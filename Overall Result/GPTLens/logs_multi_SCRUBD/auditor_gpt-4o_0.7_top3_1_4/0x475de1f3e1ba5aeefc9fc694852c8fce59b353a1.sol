        "vulnerability": "Reentrancy vulnerability",
        "reason": "The function attempts to refund gas to the sender by using `msg.sender.send`, which sends Ether back to the caller. This refund occurs after an external call is made to `ES.NewShare`, allowing an attacker to re-enter the `FreeShare` function and manipulate the state or drain funds through recursive calls. The attacker can exploit this by invoking a contract that recursively calls `FreeShare`, causing `msg.sender.send` to be executed multiple times and potentially depleting the contract's Ether balance.",

        "vulnerability": "Gas calculation manipulation",
        "reason": "The refund calculation `tx.gasprice*(startGasLeft-endGasLeft+35000)` assumes a static gas price and a fixed amount of gas used by the function, which can be inaccurate. An attacker can manipulate the gas price or the execution flow to artificially increase the refund amount, potentially leading to an over-refund that drains the contract balance. This could be exploited by inducing higher-than-expected gas consumption or manipulating the gas price externally.",

        "vulnerability": "Use of deprecated Solidity version",
        "reason": "The contract uses Solidity version `0.4.13`, which is outdated and lacks modern security features and improvements present in later versions of Solidity. This increases the risk of exploitable vulnerabilities due to missing compiler checks and optimizations, as well as the potential for compatibility issues with other contracts and libraries. Using a more recent version of Solidity would improve security and reliability.",
