If the 'nonFungibleContract' address is compromised or misconfigured to allow arbitrary calls, an attacker could withdraw the contract balance. Additionally, using 'send' to transfer Ether is unsafe due to its limited gas stipend, which might lead to failed transfers and potentially stuck funds.",

This can be exploited if the caller is a contract with a fallback function that performs further calls back into the contract, potentially allowing reentrancy attacks. The code should use 'transfer' or 'call' with proper reentrancy guards to prevent this.",

This could be exploited to drastically reduce the actual cooldown times, potentially affecting game mechanics and fairness.
