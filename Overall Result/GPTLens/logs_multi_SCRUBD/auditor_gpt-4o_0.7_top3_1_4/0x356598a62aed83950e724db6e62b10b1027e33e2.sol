        "reason": "The `withdraw` function allows the contract owner to withdraw all the Ether balance from the contract. The use of `call` to send Ether is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks, where an attacker could repeatedly call back into the contract before the balance is updated. This could potentially lead to draining of funds if the contract had more complex interactions or dependencies.",

        "vulnerability": "Potential loss of funds due to incorrect fee distribution",
        "reason": "The `lockTokens` function attempts to send Ether to `fee1Address` and `fee2Address` using `.call`. If either call fails, the function does not revert, potentially resulting in loss of funds. Additionally, if `fee1Address` is not set (i.e., zero address), no fees will be distributed, but the transaction will still proceed.",
