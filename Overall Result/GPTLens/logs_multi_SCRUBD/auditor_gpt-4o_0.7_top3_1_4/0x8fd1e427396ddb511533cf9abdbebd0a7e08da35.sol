This method does not check the success of the call, which can lead to ether being lost if the call fails or if the recipient is a contract that does not accept ETH via a fallback function. Additionally, this function can be exploited if the owner sets msg.sender to a contract that reverts the call, causing the holder's balance to decrease without transferring ETH.",
