        "vulnerability": "No checks for transfer success",
        "reason": "The multiSend function does not check the return value of the transfer function calls. In Solidity versions prior to 0.5.0, the transfer function does not return a boolean indicating success. However, if the token contract follows the ERC20 standard, it should. Failing to check the return value could mean that failed transfers are not detected, potentially leading to a situation where tokens are not actually sent to all intended recipients, but the function still reports success.",

        "reason": "The constructor BDSMAirdrop does not validate the _tokenAddress parameter, which is intended to be a token contract address. If an incorrect or malicious address is passed, it could lead to incorrect behavior of the contract, such as interacting with a malicious contract that does not adhere to the expected token interface, potentially allowing an attacker to exploit this interaction.",

        "vulnerability": "Potential for setting an inappropriate airdrop value",
        "reason": "The function changeAirdropValue allows the owner to set any uint256 value for defValue without restrictions. This could lead to setting an inappropriately high value that could deplete the contract's token balance in a single transaction if used in the multiSend function, especially if there are no checks to ensure that the contract has a sufficient balance before executing transfers.",
