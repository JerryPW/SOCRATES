        "vulnerability": "Missing allowance check before transfer",
        "reason": "The function `transferFrom` executes the `_transfer` function before checking if the `msg.sender` has sufficient allowance to transfer tokens on behalf of the `sender`. According to the ERC20 standard, the allowance should be checked before making the transfer to prevent unauthorized transfers. This error allows an attacker to transfer tokens even without having the proper allowance, which could lead to unauthorized token transfers.",

        "vulnerability": "Potential underflow in balance deduction",
        "reason": "In the `_getFeeSell` function, the balances of the `account` are deducted by `devFee + burnCount` without ensuring that the account has enough balance to cover these fees. This may lead to a potential underflow, especially since Solidity version 0.8+ has built-in overflow/underflow checks. However, deducting balances without proper checks can still cause logical errors, resulting in incorrect balance states.",

        "vulnerability": "Potential reentrancy issue with external call",
        "reason": "The `makeLiquidity` function makes an external call to the Uniswap router's `addLiquidityETH` function, which transfers ETH and adds liquidity. This operation is performed without any reentrancy guard, and since Solidity 0.8+ does not automatically prevent reentrancy, this may open up potential reentrancy vulnerabilities, especially if the external call is to a contract that could reenter the `makeLiquidity` function or any other vulnerable function in the contract.",
