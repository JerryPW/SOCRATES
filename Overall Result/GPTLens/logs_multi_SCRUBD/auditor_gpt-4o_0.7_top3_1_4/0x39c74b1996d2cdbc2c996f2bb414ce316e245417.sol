        "reason": "The function uses the send method to transfer ETH, which may fail silently if the recipient is a contract and its fallback function consumes more than 2300 gas. This can lead to inconsistent states and unexpected behavior. It would be safer to use transfer, which reverts on failure, ensuring the function behaves correctly and predictably.",
