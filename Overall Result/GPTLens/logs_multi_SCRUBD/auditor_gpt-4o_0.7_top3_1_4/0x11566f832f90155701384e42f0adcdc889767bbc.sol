        "reason": "The renounceOwnership function sets the contract owner to the zero address. This action is irreversible and will permanently lock out the original owner from performing restricted actions, such as updating settings or recovering from an attack. This could lead to a loss of control over the contract, making it impossible to upgrade or manage in the future.",

        "vulnerability": "Centralized control over blocking",
        "reason": "This function allows the owner to arbitrarily block any address by adding it to the 'bots' mapping. While this may be intended to prevent malicious activity, it also provides the owner with the capability to block legitimate users from interacting with the contract, potentially freezing their funds. This centralized control could be exploited if the owner's private key is compromised or if the owner acts maliciously.",

        "reason": "The manualsend function allows the address set as _teamAddress to withdraw all ETH held by the contract. This functionality provides a single entity with the ability to drain the contract's balance at any time, without any oversight or restrictions. If the designated team address is compromised, stolen, or acts maliciously, it could lead to a complete loss of all collected funds from fees.",
