        "vulnerability": "Uninitialized owner in constructor",
        "reason": "The constructor does not use the latest Solidity constructor syntax. In Solidity versions <0.4.22, constructors are defined with the same name as the contract. This can lead to unintended behavior or potential vulnerabilities if there are naming conflicts or if someone could redeploy the contract with a different version of Solidity. This contract should be updated to use the constructor keyword to prevent misidentification.",

        "vulnerability": "Lack of input validation",
        "reason": "The function does not validate the newOwner address, allowing the owner to transfer ownership to an invalid address (e.g., 0x0). This could potentially lock the contract functions that are restricted by the onlyOwner modifier, leading to a denial of service.",

        "vulnerability": "Improper handling of currentRound balance",
        "reason": "If the currentRound has not paid out but the balance is greater than 0, the contract attempts to withdraw and transfer ownership. However, if the withdraw call fails, the contract does not handle or revert this failure properly. This could lead to a situation where the contract logic assumes funds have been withdrawn when they have not, potentially leaving funds stuck in the contract.",
