        "vulnerability": "Reentrancy vulnerability",
        "reason": "The function `withdrawStuckETH` allows the contract owner to withdraw the entire balance of ETH from the contract. However, the use of the low-level call method without any reentrancy guard opens up the possibility of a reentrancy attack. An attacker could exploit this by recursively calling the withdraw function before the balance is updated, allowing them to drain funds.",

        "vulnerability": "Incorrect balance update order",
        "reason": "In the `tokenTransfer` function, the balances are updated after the tokens are split and taxes are calculated. This order of operations can potentially lead to incorrect balances if there are any unforeseen issues in `calculateTax` or `splitTaxTokens`. It's safer to first update the sender's balance, then perform calculations, and finally update the recipient's balance.",

        "vulnerability": "Potential for slippage exploitation",
        "reason": "The `swapTokensForETH` function uses `swapExactTokensForETHSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens` with a minimum output amount of 0, which makes the transaction vulnerable to slippage attacks. An attacker could manipulate the market to increase the price impact, resulting in the contract receiving significantly less ETH than expected.",
