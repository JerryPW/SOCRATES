        "vulnerability": "Reentrancy vulnerability",
        "reason": "The RefundDeposit function calls addr.send(amt) without using a reentrancy guard. This allows an attacker to potentially exploit the function by recursively calling it before the state variable Available is updated, leading to multiple withdrawals.",

        "reason": "The function SetPrcntRate uses Holder for authority control, but the contract does not correctly initialize it in the constructor and relies on init() to be called separately. This could allow unauthorized users to set the prcntRate if init() is never called or if msg.sender is not properly verified.",
