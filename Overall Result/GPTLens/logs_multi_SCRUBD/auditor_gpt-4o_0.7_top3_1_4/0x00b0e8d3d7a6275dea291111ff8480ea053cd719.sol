        "vulnerability": "Ownership Renunciation",
        "reason": "The `renounceOwnership` function allows the current owner to set the owner address to zero, effectively making the contract ownerless. This is a severe vulnerability if the contract requires an owner for critical administrative tasks, as it can leave the contract without any way to manage or upgrade it in the future.",

        "vulnerability": "Privileged Function Misuse",
        "reason": "Similar to `manualswap`, the `manualsend` function allows `_feeAddrWallet1` to send the entire ETH balance of the contract to predefined wallets. If `_feeAddrWallet1` is compromised, an attacker can exploit this to steal all ETH held by the contract.",
