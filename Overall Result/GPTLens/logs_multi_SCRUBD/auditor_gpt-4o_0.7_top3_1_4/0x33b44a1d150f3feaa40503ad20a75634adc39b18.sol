        "reason": "The `withdraw` function uses `send`, which transfers ether without a gas limit and does not properly update the user's balance before sending funds. This allows an attacker to create a reentrancy attack, repeatedly calling the `withdraw` function before the balance is updated, allowing them to drain the contract.",

        "reason": "The `kill` function allows the contract to be destroyed by the owner when the balance is zero. However, if an attacker takes over the ownership via the vulnerable `initCapsule`, they can call `kill` and destroy the contract, making it impossible for any remaining logic to execute.",
