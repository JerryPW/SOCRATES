        "reason": "The transfer function does not check for fees, allowing users to transfer tokens without considering any transaction fees that may be applicable. This can be exploited to bypass fee mechanisms, as the _transfer function is responsible for handling the fee logic. Since the transfer function directly calls _transfer, any flaws in fee logic within _transfer could be exploited.",

        "vulnerability": "Zero Fee Setting",
        "reason": "This function sets both buyliqFee and buymktFee to zero without any conditions or time limits. If an attacker gains access to the owner's private key, or if the owner account is compromised, they could call this function to effectively disable transaction fees indefinitely, leading to potential loss in revenue or manipulation of tokenomics.",

        "vulnerability": "Potential Slippage Loss",
        "reason": "This function uses swapExactTokensForETHSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens with a minimum amount of zero (amountOutMin = 0), which exposes the contract to significant slippage. This could be exploited by front-running or sandwich attacks, where an attacker could manipulate the token price to gain ETH at more favorable rates, leading to potential loss of funds during swaps.",
