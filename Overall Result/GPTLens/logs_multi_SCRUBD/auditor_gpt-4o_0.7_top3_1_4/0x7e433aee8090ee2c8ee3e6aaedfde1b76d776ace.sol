        "reason": "The 'end_time' is set directly to 'lockTime', which is expected to be a future timestamp. However, without proper validation, the 'lockTime' can be set to a past or current timestamp, allowing immediate release of tokens. This makes the locking mechanism ineffective. The function should set 'end_time' to 'now + lockTime' assuming 'lockTime' is a duration, or validate that 'lockTime' is a future timestamp.",

        "vulnerability": "Lack of transfer return value check",
        "reason": "The 'release' function calls 'token_reward.transfer', but does not check its return value. If the transfer fails for any reason (e.g., due to insufficient gas or a failure in the token contract), the function will still proceed as if the transfer was successful. This could lead to a false assumption that the tokens have been transferred when they have not, potentially leading to discrepancies and misuse of funds.",

        "reason": "The 'transferOwnership' function allows transferring ownership to any address, including addresses that are contracts or not capable of managing ownership (such as address(0)). While the function prevents transferring ownership to address(0) directly, it does not prevent transferring to other unfit addresses, which could result in the loss of control of the contract if the new owner does not handle the ownership properly.",
