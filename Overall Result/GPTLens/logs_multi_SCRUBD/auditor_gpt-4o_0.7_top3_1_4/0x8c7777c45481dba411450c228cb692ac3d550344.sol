        "vulnerability": "Incorrect Minimum Deposit Check",
        "reason": "The Deposit function uses a '>' instead of '>=' when checking if the msg.value is greater than the MinDeposit. This means that users depositing exactly 1 ether will not be able to deposit, which is likely not the intended functionality. This can lead to user confusion and potential loss of funds if the contract is interacted with under the assumption that 1 ether deposits are valid.",

        "vulnerability": "Reentrancy Vulnerability",
        "reason": "The CashOut function is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The call to msg.sender.call.value(_am)() sends ether to the caller before updating the balances mapping. An attacker could exploit this by recursively calling CashOut within the fallback function to drain the contract's funds before the balance is updated.",
