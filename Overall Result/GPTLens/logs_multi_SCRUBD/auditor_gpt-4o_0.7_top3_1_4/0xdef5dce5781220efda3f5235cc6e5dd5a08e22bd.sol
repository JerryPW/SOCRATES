        "vulnerability": "Destruction of contract by owner.",
        "reason": "The presence of a selfdestruct function allows the owner to destroy the contract, which transfers all contract funds to the owner's address and makes the contract unusable. This can be exploited by a malicious owner to steal all funds and terminate the contract unexpectedly, leaving other users without recourse.",

        "vulnerability": "Unsafe external call and incorrect token distribution.",
        "reason": "The fallback function sends ether to the owner without checking for the success of the transfer, which is unsafe and can lead to failed transactions if the owner's receiving address has issues (e.g., a contract that does not accept ether transfers). Additionally, it calculates the token amount using multiplication with buyPrice, which is inconsistent with the division used in the buy function, potentially leading to incorrect token amounts being transferred.",
