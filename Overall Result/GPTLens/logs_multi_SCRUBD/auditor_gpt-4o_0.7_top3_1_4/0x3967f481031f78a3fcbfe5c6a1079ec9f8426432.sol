        "reason": "This function allows anyone to transfer the entire balance of the contract to a single address. The lack of a proper access control mechanism means that any user can call this function and drain the contract's balance by specifying their own address.",

        "reason": "This function does not check if the contract balance is sufficient to cover the total transfer amounts.

        "vulnerability": "Unsafe usage of call() for token transfer",
        "reason": "The function uses the low-level call() method to transfer tokens, which does not guarantee that the function exists or executes correctly. This can lead to failed token transfers without the caller being aware, as call() does not throw errors on failure. Instead, it returns a boolean indicating success or failure, which is not being checked here. Moreover, this introduces a potential reentrancy vulnerability if the token contract is malicious.",
