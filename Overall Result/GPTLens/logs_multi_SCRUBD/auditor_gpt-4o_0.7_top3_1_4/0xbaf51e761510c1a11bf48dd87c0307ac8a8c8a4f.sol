        "vulnerability": "Reentrancy vulnerability",
        "reason": "The CashOut function uses msg.sender.call.value(_am)(), which is a low-level call that sends ether and allows the calling contract to call back into the CashOut function before balances[msg.sender] is updated. This can lead to a reentrancy attack where an attacker can repeatedly withdraw funds beyond their balance.",

        "reason": "The Deposit function only checks if msg.value is greater than MinDeposit, allowing any deposit above 1 ether. However, it should use '>=' to include exactly 1 ether deposits. This issue may lead to confusion and potential misuse, as users may expect deposits of exactly 1 ether to be valid.",
