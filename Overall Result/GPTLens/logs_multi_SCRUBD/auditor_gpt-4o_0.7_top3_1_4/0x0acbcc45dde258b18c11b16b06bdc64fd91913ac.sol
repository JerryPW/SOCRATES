This can lead to a situation where the contract is stuck with the newOwner being set but unable to take control, thus freezing any ownership-dependent functionality.",

        "vulnerability": "Reentrancy vulnerability",
        "reason": "The withdraw function uses a noAnyReentrancy modifier that sets bitlocks to uint(-1) before the transfer and resets it afterward. However, this does not prevent reentrancy effectively because the external call to beneficiary.transfer(_amount) could potentially trigger a fallback function in the beneficiary contract that reenters this contract. This is a classic reentrancy vulnerability where an attacker can craft a malicious contract as the beneficiary to drain funds.",

        "vulnerability": "Integer division by zero",
        "reason": "The function setTokenPriceAsRatio does not check if _tokenCount is zero, leading to a division by zero error when setting currentPrice.
