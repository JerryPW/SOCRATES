        "reason": "The `renounceOwnership` function allows the current owner to set the owner address to zero, effectively leaving the contract without an owner. This could lead to a situation where no one can call functions that are restricted to the owner, potentially freezing critical functionality.",

        "vulnerability": "Potential reentrancy attack",
        "reason": "The `withdrawEther` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks because it calls an external address with `send` before updating the contract's state.
