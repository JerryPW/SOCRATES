        "reason": "The setBots function allows the owner to mark any address as a bot, effectively preventing them from participating in transactions. This centralized control can be misused by the owner to block legitimate users from transferring tokens, leading to potential censorship and loss of funds for those users.",

This results in an irreversible loss of control over functions restricted by the onlyOwner modifier.
