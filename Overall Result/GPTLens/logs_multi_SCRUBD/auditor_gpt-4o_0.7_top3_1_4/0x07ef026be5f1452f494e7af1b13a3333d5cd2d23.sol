        "vulnerability": "Lack of Ownership Renouncement",
        "reason": "The `transferOwnership` function allows the owner to transfer ownership to another address, but it does not provide a mechanism to renounce ownership completely, which can be a desirable feature if the smart contract is meant to be fully decentralized after deployment. This can lead to centralization risks where the owner could potentially misuse their privileges.",

        "reason": "In the `swapBack` function, the call to `distributor.deposit{value: amountETHReflection}()` is wrapped in a try-catch block, but the catch block does not handle any errors meaningfully. This can lead to silent failures, making it hard to detect and diagnose issues during operation, which could result in loss of funds or failure to execute intended logic.",

        "vulnerability": "Risk of Front-running",
        "reason": "The `buyTokens` function performs a token swap without any slippage protection. An attacker could front-run this transaction by submitting a transaction with a higher gas price, causing the token price to be manipulated unfavorably by the time the swap is executed, resulting in potential financial loss.",
