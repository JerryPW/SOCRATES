        "reason": "The swapBack function involves multiple external calls such as swapTokensForETH and addLiquidity, which could potentially lead to reentrancy attacks if the token being swapped or liquidity added has malicious fallback functions. The use of reentrancy guards (lockTheSwap modifier) helps mitigate this risk, but thorough testing and auditing are necessary to ensure no reentrancy vulnerabilities exist, especially since it involves transferring ETH.",
