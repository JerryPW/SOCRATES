        "vulnerability": "Incorrect Balance Calculation in ownerTransfer",
        "reason": "The function calculates the available balance by comparing the contract's token balance with the sum of current balances for all accounts. This method is flawed because it does not account for the possibility of tokens being transferred out of the contract by other means. If tokens are transferred out of the contract, the require statement may pass incorrectly, allowing the owner to transfer more tokens than should be available, potentially leading to an overdraft of the contract's actual holdings.",
