        "reason": "The use of `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` is an unsafe way to transfer Ether because it forwards all available gas and opens up the contract to various attacks, including reentrancy. Using `transfer` or `send` is safer as they only forward 2300 gas, which is generally not enough to execute a reentrancy attack.",

        "reason": "The `AddMessage` function is public and anyone can call it, which allows attackers to spam the history with arbitrary messages. This could lead to unnecessary storage consumption and potential DoS situations by filling up the blockchain storage quickly.",
