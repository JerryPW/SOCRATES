        "reason": "The 'getTokens' function does not check if the contract has enough tokens to fulfill the bounty.

        "reason": "The 'setBountyAmount' function allows the owner to set any positive value for the bounty amount without any upper limit. This can lead to a situation where the bounty amount is set higher than the contract's token balance, causing failures in the 'getTokens' function, as there might not be enough tokens to distribute to all participants. This could be exploited by setting an unsustainable bounty amount, potentially leading to contract malfunction.",
