        "reason": "The `voteForCandidate` function is overloaded, which can lead to unexpected behavior. An attacker could exploit this by calling a specific overloaded version to bypass certain logic or checks, especially since the overloaded functions with referrers do not have checks for the validity or presence of a referrer. This could potentially lead to incorrect state updates or rewards being misallocated.",

        "reason": "The `sendReward` function directly transfers Ether to the `to` address before updating the voter's vote balances.
