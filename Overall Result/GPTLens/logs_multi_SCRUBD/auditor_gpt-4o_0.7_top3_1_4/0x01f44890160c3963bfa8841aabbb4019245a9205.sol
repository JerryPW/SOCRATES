        "vulnerability": "Loss of Ownership",
        "reason": "The function allows the owner to renounce ownership, setting the owner to the zero address. This action is irreversible and would prevent any further functions that require `onlyOwner` access from being executed. It effectively locks out any ability to update or manage the contract, including potentially critical functions like managing fees or trading settings. This could be exploited by an attacker if they trick the owner into renouncing ownership, resulting in a permanently unmanaged contract.",

        "vulnerability": "Single Address Control",
        "reason": "The manualswap function can only be called by _feeAddrWallet1, which means this single address has exclusive control over when tokens are swapped for ETH. If this address is compromised, an attacker could repeatedly call this function to manipulate the token balance and potentially disrupt the token's liquidity and price on exchanges. Moreover, if _feeAddrWallet1 loses access to this address, there would be no mechanism to trigger manual swaps, potentially resulting in stuck tokens.",

        "vulnerability": "Potential for Blacklisting",
        "reason": "The setBots function allows the owner to arbitrarily add addresses to a blacklist, preventing them from participating in transfers. While this may be intended to block malicious actors, there is potential for abuse if the owner adds legitimate users to the blacklist. This could be exploited to manipulate the market by selectively blocking trades from specific addresses, potentially affecting the token's liquidity and market perception.",
