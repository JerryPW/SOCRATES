        "vulnerability": "ownerless_contract",
        "reason": "The renounceOwnership function allows the contract owner to set the owner to the zero address, effectively making the contract ownerless. This can be a severe issue if the contract relies on the owner for administrative functions or if the contract needs to be upgraded or maintained in the future. An ownerless contract can lead to a lack of control over the contract's functions and parameters, potentially making it vulnerable to exploitation.",

        "vulnerability": "bot_blacklisting_centralization",
        "reason": "The blockBots function allows the contract owner to arbitrarily blacklist addresses by adding them to the bots mapping. This centralization of power can be exploited by a malicious owner to block legitimate users from participating in the contract. Additionally, since this can be done at any time, users are at risk of losing access to their tokens if blacklisted. This function could be used maliciously to censor or manipulate token transfers.",

        "vulnerability": "unrestricted_eth_transfer",
        "reason": "The sendETHToFee function transfers ETH from the contract address to the _teamAddress and _marketingFunds without any restrictions or conditions. This could be dangerous if the function can be triggered without proper checks, as it might allow an attacker to drain ETH from the contract if they can manipulate conditions to trigger the function. Additionally, this method assumes that the ETH balance of the contract is always sufficient, which may not be the case in all scenarios, leading to potential reentrancy risks if not handled properly.",
