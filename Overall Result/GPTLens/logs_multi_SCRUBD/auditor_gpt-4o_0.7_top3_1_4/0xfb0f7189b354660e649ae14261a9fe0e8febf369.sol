        "reason": "The multiplication operation (totalCandyNo * 1e18) can lead to an overflow in the token transfer, potentially causing unexpected behavior or loss of tokens if totalCandyNo is large enough. This vulnerability arises because Solidity 0.4.18 does not have built-in overflow checks.",

        "vulnerability": "Reentrancy vulnerability",
        "reason": "The fallback function allows for the transfer of tokens before updating the balanceOf mapping and totalCandyNo. If the token being transferred follows the ERC223 standard or includes a callback function, it can lead to a reentrancy attack where an attacker could repeatedly call the fallback function to drain tokens.",
