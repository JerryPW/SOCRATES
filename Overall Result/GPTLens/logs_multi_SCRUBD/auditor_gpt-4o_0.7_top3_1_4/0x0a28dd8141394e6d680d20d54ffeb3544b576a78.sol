        "vulnerability": "Integer overflow/underflow in betting calculations",
        "reason": "The `play` function and its associated `_play` function perform calculations on user-provided bet amounts without using SafeMath for all operations. This oversight can lead to integer overflow or underflow, allowing attackers to manipulate the bet amounts and potentially causing incorrect Ether transfers.",

        "reason": "The `getAward` function iterates over an array of play numbers without imposing a limit on its size.

An attacker could exploit this to prevent legitimate users from claiming their awards.",
