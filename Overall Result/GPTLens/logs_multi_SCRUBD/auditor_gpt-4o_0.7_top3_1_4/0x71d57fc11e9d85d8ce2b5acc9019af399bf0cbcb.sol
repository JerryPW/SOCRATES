        "reason": "The 'end_time' is set to 'lockTime', which is directly passed by the caller. This allows the owner to set the 'end_time' to a past time or any arbitrary value. This could potentially allow the owner to immediately call 'release' after locking tokens, bypassing the intended lock duration.",

        "vulnerability": "End time manipulation",
        "reason": "This function determines if the lock period is over by comparing the current time with 'end_time'. Since 'end_time' can be set arbitrarily by the owner during the 'lock' function, this check can be easily manipulated, making the locking mechanism ineffective.",

        "vulnerability": "Lack of reentrancy protection",
        "reason": "The 'release' function transfers tokens to the beneficiary without using any reentrancy protection mechanisms. Although a reentrancy attack is less likely in this context due to the nature of token transfers, it is still a best practice to use reentrancy guards (e.g., a mutex or the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern) to ensure state changes are made prior to any external calls.",
