        "reason": "The receive function allows the contract to accept Ether, but there is no clear mechanism to withdraw this Ether for most users. This could lead to a situation where Ether is locked within the contract without a means to recover it, posing a significant risk of loss of funds.",

        "vulnerability": "Reentrancy Risk",
        "reason": "The function `addLiquidity` involves transferring Ether and tokens and then calling external contracts without using any reentrancy guards like `nonReentrant` modifier.

        "vulnerability": "Improper Access Control",
        "reason": "The `teamWithdraw` function allows team members to withdraw Ether from the contract based on the balance recorded in `m_TeamBalance`. However, the function does not have appropriate access control, as it only checks for team membership via the `m_TeamMember` mapping, which could potentially be manipulated if there are vulnerabilities in other parts of the contract that allow modification of this mapping.",
