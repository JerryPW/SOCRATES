This could result in funds being locked in the contract if any recipient fails to receive the funds, and the remaining balance will be sent to the wallet, potentially causing discrepancies in expected payments.",

        "reason": "The contract does not handle the case where .send() fails for any of the recipients, which means that the function will continue executing even if some transfers fail. This could lead to the contract sending the remaining balance to the wallet without alerting the caller about failed transactions, potentially causing loss of funds.",
