        "vulnerability": "Missing authorization removal",
        "reason": "When ownership is transferred, the previous owner's authorization is not revoked. This means the previous owner retains authorization privileges, which is not expected in a typical ownership transfer scenario. An attacker can exploit this by transferring ownership to a new address while retaining control, potentially leading to unauthorized access.",

        "vulnerability": "Token swap failure handling",
        "reason": "The function attempts to swap tokens and catches any failure without reverting the transaction. This can lead to unexpected behaviors where the function continues execution despite a failure, potentially causing incorrect balances or state inconsistencies. An attacker could exploit this by causing the swap to fail under certain conditions, leading to potential payout manipulation.",

        "vulnerability": "Potential reentrancy attack",
        "reason": "The buyTokens function performs a swap operation which involves sending ETH. If the receiving contract is untrusted, it can potentially execute a reentrancy attack by calling back into the contract before the state is updated. Although this function is marked as 'internal', if indirectly exposed or improperly used, it could be a vector for reentrancy. Proper use of reentrancy guards or checks-effects-interactions pattern is recommended to mitigate such risks.",
