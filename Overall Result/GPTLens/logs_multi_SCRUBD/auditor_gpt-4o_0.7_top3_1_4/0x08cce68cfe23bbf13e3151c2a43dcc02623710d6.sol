        "vulnerability": "Lack of safe transfer checks",
        "reason": "The transferOwnership function directly changes the owner to a new address without any checks or confirmations. This poses a risk if the owner mistakenly sets an incorrect address or if an attacker manages to call this function due to a compromised owner address. Implementing a two-step process or requiring a confirmation could mitigate this risk.",

        "vulnerability": "Reentrancy risk with external calls",
        "reason": "The swapBack function involves transferring ETH and calling an external function moneyPrinter.deposit() without checking the result properly. This could be exploited if the moneyPrinter contract has a fallback function that executes code and interacts with the state. Implementing checks-effects-interactions pattern and using reentrancy guards can help mitigate this risk.",

        "vulnerability": "Potential race condition on allowance change",
        "reason": "The approve function allows setting allowances directly, which may lead to a race condition where the current allowance is spent before it is changed, especially if the spender is using the allowance. Utilizing the increaseAllowance and decreaseAllowance pattern is recommended to mitigate this race condition and prevent potential double-spend issues.",
