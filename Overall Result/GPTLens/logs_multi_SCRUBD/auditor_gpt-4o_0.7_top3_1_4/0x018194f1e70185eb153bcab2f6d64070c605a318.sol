        "reason": "The function 'owner_rescueERCTokens' allows the owner to withdraw any excess ERC20 tokens from the contract address. This is a potential vulnerability because it allows the owner to drain ERC20 tokens that might have been sent to the contract by mistake or as a part of a larger transaction. There is no limit or condition for what 'excessTokens' can be, allowing the owner to potentially withdraw all tokens if 'pendingTaxTokens' is set to zero or a very low value.",
