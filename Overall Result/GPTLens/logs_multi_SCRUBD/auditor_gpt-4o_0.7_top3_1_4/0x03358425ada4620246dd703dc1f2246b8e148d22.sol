        "reason": "The `payout` function is called directly after adding a participant, which can lead to an uncontrolled loop. If there are many participants, the loop in `payout` may run out of gas before completing, potentially leaving some participants unpaid. This can be exploited by an attacker to create denial of service by forcing many participants, preventing others from getting payouts.",
