        "vulnerability": "Unsafe Ether withdrawal",
        "reason": "The `withdraw` function uses `send` to transfer Ether, which forwards only 2300 gas and may fail due to gas stipend issues. Additionally, it does not handle failure cases. The use of `send` without checking for a successful transfer can result in unintended Ether lockup. It is safer to use `transfer` or `call` with proper checks.",

        "vulnerability": "Lack of allowance check",
        "reason": "The `transfer` function does not check for allowance, meaning that anyone with access to another's private key could transfer tokens without prior approval. This violates the ERC20 standard which aims to enforce checks on token allowances to prevent unauthorized transfers.",

        "vulnerability": "Race condition vulnerability",
        "reason": "The `approve` function does not prevent the race condition known as the 'ERC20 approve/transferFrom race condition'. If a spender is given an allowance and then spends the allowed tokens, the owner might reset the allowance to a lower number or zero, but the spender can still use the original allowance until the change is enacted. This can lead to double spending of allowance.",
