        "reason": "The function allows the contract owner to transfer any ERC20 tokens from the contract's balance to their own address, except for the tokens associated with POWH.

        "reason": "The function does not reset `ownerCandidate` after ownership transfer is accepted. If `acceptOwnership` is called by the current `ownerCandidate`, they remain able to become the owner again without going through the `changeOwner` process, which may not be the intended behavior and could lead to potential misuse.",
