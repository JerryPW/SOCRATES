        "reason": "The approve function does not check for the current allowance before setting it to a new value. This can lead to the 'race condition' problem where if someone else is using the allowance, it could lead to unexpected spending of tokens. The recommended mitigation is to require the allowance to be set to zero before setting a new value.",

        "vulnerability": "Reentrancy Vulnerability",
        "reason": "The withdrawEth function transfers Ether to the wallet without updating the contract state before the transfer. This can allow reentrancy attacks where an attacker can call withdrawEth again before the balance is updated, potentially draining the contract. The transfer should be done after state changes to mitigate this risk.",

        "vulnerability": "Lack of Verification for Token Transfer Success",
        "reason": "The returnTokens function does not check the return value of the OppToken.transfer call. If the transfer fails, the function will still emit a TokensTransfered event and return true, which could mislead the owner into thinking the tokens were successfully returned. It is important to check the return value of token transfers to ensure they are successful.",
