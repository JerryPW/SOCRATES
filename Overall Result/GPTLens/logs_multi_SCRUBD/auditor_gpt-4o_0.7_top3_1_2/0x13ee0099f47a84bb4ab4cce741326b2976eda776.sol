        "reason": "The setWithdrawAddress function allows the withdraw address to be changed by the current withdrawer. If the current withdrawer address is compromised, an attacker can change the withdraw address to a malicious address, thus redirecting all funds of the contract to themselves. To mitigate this risk, access to this function should be more strictly controlled or multi-signature mechanisms should be used.",

        "reason": "The _transfer function calls _swapTokensForEthOnTransfer before completing the token transfer. Although the function uses a lockTheSwap modifier, the swap operation could still interact with external contracts, potentially introducing reentrancy vulnerabilities if not handled properly. This can be exploited if an attacker controls one of the tokens involved in the swap to execute arbitrary code during the swap process.",

        "vulnerability": "Improper allowance handling",

A better practice would be to always update the allowance and then check if it is sufficient to ensure consistency and prevent abuse.",
