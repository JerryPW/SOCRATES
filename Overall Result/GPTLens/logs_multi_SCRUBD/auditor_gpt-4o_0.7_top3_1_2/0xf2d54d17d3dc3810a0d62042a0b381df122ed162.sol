Additionally, there is no check to prevent setting the owner to the zero address, which can lead to a loss of control over the contract.",

This could allow reentrancy attacks if the owner is a smart contract with fallback functions designed to exploit this vulnerability. Although the owner is typically an externally owned account, the contract's lack of restrictions allows a contract to assume ownership, posing a security risk.",

        "vulnerability": "Reentrancy vulnerability",
        "reason": "The withdraw function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks since it updates the user's balance after the transfer operation.
