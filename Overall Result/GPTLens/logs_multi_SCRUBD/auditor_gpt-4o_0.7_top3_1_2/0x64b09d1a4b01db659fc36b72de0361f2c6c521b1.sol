        "vulnerability": "Missing allowance change event",
        "reason": "The function does not emit an event when the allowance is changed, which can lead to issues in tracking changes to allowances. This can hinder transparency and make it difficult to track approval changes, potentially leading to unnoticed unauthorized transfers.",

        "reason": "The buy function does not check if the calculated token amount is greater than zero or if the contract has enough tokens to transfer to the buyer. This can lead to failed transactions or unintended behavior where buyers receive no tokens for their payment.",

        "reason": "The selfdestruct function allows the contract owner to destroy the contract and send all its Ether balance to the owner's address. This is a severe vulnerability as it can be exploited by the contract owner to abscond with all funds, leaving token holders with worthless tokens and no recourse.",
