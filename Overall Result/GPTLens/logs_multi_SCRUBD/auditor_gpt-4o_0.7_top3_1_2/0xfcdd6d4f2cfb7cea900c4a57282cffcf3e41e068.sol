        "reason": "The function uses `send` to transfer funds, which only forwards 2300 gas, potentially causing it to fail for recipients with complex fallback functions. This could lead to funds being stuck in the contract as the `send` call fails silently without reverting the transaction. Using `transfer` or `call` with proper checks is safer.",

        "vulnerability": "Reentrancy vulnerability",
        "reason": "The `payInterest` function updates the `interestPaid` mapping after calling `payout`, which itself calls `send` on the recipient. If the recipient's fallback function calls back into `payInterest`, it could exploit this to withdraw more funds than intended. The state changes should occur before the external call to prevent reentrancy.",
