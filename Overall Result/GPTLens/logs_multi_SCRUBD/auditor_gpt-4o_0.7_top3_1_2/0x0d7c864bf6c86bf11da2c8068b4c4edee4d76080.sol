        "vulnerability": "Missing checks-effects-interactions pattern",
        "reason": "The withdraw function transfers the entire balance of the contract to the contractOwner without updating any state variables before the transfer. This makes it susceptible to reentrancy attacks if any address with malicious fallback functions is able to become the contractOwner. Although the onlyContractOwner modifier is used, it is still a best practice to follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern to prevent potential reentrancy vulnerabilities.",

        "vulnerability": "Potential loss of funds due to failed sends",
        "reason": "The updateAd function uses the send method to transfer funds to theInvestor and lastOwner. The send method only forwards 2300 gas and returns a boolean indicating success or failure. If the send operation fails, there is no rollback of state changes or error handling, which could result in a loss of funds and inconsistent contract state. It is advisable to use the call method with proper checks to ensure successful transfers.",

        "vulnerability": "Potential loss of funds due to failed sends",
        "reason": "Similar to the updateAd function, updateInvestor uses the send method to transfer funds to theInvestor. If the send operation fails, the contract does not handle the failure, potentially leading to a loss of funds and incorrect state updates. Using the call method with proper checks and handling would mitigate this issue, ensuring the transfer is successful before proceeding with state changes.",
