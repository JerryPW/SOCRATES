This could allow the owner to accidentally or maliciously set the ownership to an invalid address (e.g., the zero address), which could render the contract without an owner, making administrative functions inaccessible.",

        "reason": "The function interacts with external contracts and then deletes the current round reference. If any of the external contract calls (distributeWinnings, claimOwnerFee, or withdraw) are exploited for reentrancy before the state of the current round is deleted, it could lead to reentrant calls that exploit the contract's logic or state.",

        "vulnerability": "Improper access control",
        "reason": "The function uses the onlyCurator modifier for access control, but if the curator address is compromised or if the current curator becomes inactive (e.g., losing their private key), it could lead to a situation where the curator cannot be updated. Furthermore, the function does not validate the new curator address, allowing potential setting to an invalid address.",
