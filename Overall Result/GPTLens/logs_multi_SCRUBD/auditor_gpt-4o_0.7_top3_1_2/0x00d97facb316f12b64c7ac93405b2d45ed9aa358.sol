        "reason": "The renounceOwnership function allows the current owner to renounce ownership of the contract, setting the owner to the zero address. This effectively makes the contract ownerless and can lead to the inability to perform any future owner-only functions, potentially freezing certain functionalities of the contract if owner intervention is required.",

        "reason": "The manualswap function allows the address _feeAddrWallet1 to swap all tokens held by the contract for ETH. This gives excessive control to a single wallet address, which may lead to potential misuse if the wallet is compromised. An attacker gaining control of this address could deplete the contract's token balance for personal gain.",
