        "vulnerability": "Unrestricted fund transfer by admin",
        "reason": "The emergencyDrain function allows the admin to transfer any amount of tokens to any address without any restriction or condition. This means that the admin can potentially drain all tokens from the contract, which poses a severe risk if the admin's private key is compromised or if the admin acts maliciously.",

        "vulnerability": "Token transferability toggle control",
        "reason": "The transfer function is controlled by the isTokenTransferable flag, which can be toggled by the owner.

        "vulnerability": "Repeated airdrops to same recipient",
        "reason": "The airDropSingleAmount function utilizes a mapping to prevent multiple airdrops to the same recipient. However, this mapping only prevents multiple airdrops within this specific function, meaning recipients can still receive multiple airdrops from other functions like twitterDropSingleAmount or signatureDropSingleAmount. This could be exploited by a recipient to receive more tokens than intended by participating in multiple airdrop types.",
