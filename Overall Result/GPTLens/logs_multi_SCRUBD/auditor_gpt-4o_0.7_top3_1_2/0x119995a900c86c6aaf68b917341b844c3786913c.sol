Since this function is external and doesn't use a reentrancy guard, it is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack.

        "reason": "Although there is a check to prevent transferring ownership to the zero address, there is no mechanism to prevent the contract from being locked if the new owner becomes a black hole or non-responsive.
