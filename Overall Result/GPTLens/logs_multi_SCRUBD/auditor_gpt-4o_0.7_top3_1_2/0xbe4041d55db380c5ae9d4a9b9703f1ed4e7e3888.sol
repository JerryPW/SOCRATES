        "vulnerability": "Incorrect Initialization Check",
        "reason": "The contract uses `intitalized` as a flag to prevent re-initialization, but the spelling is incorrect ('intitalized' instead of 'initialized'). This means the check will always pass, allowing anyone to reset the minimum sum after it has been initially set. This could be exploited by an attacker to set the minimum sum to a very low value and withdraw funds that should have been locked based on the initial rules.",

        "reason": "The use of `call.value()` to send Ether is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. An attacker could exploit this by recursively calling the `Collect` function before the balance is updated, allowing them to withdraw more funds than intended. The balance update should occur before the external call to prevent this.",
