        "vulnerability": "Irreversible Ownership Renouncement",
        "reason": "The `renounceOwnership` function sets the owner to the zero address, permanently relinquishing control of the contract. This prevents any further administrative actions that require owner permissions, such as updating the maximum transaction amount or adjusting fees, and can potentially lock critical contract functionality if the owner role is required for future operations.",

        "vulnerability": "Potential Front-Running",
        "reason": "The function `swapTokensForEth` does not set a minimum amount of ETH that must be received for the swap to succeed (amountOutMin = 0). This exposes the function to front-running, where an attacker can manipulate the price by executing transactions before and after the swap, potentially causing the contract to receive significantly less ETH than expected.",

        "vulnerability": "Insufficient Liquidity Safeguards",
        "reason": "The `startTrading` function initializes liquidity without any slippage control (min amountToken and amountETH are set to 0). This may lead to significant slippage or price manipulation, where an attacker can exploit the absence of slippage safeguards to gain a disproportionate share of the liquidity pool at the contract's expense.",
