        "reason": "The `Count` function sends Ether to arbitrary addresses stored in the `Tx` array without ensuring that the recipient contracts are secure.

        "reason": "The `while (counter>0)` loop accesses `Tx[counter]` without properly checking if `counter` is a valid index, leading to potential out-of-bounds access. The decrement operation `counter-=1` runs the risk of underflow, which could result in accessing incorrect or unintended storage slots.",
