        "reason": "The setPeriod function allows any user to modify the periods array. This is a critical vulnerability because periods dictate the timing for vesting and limits. An attacker can exploit this by setting periods to arbitrary values, potentially disrupting the vesting schedule and allowing themselves or others to withdraw more tokens than intended.",

        "reason": "The ownerTransfer function calculates the total current balance of all accounts and checks that the contract's balance exceeds this before allowing a transfer. However, it does not account for the possibility of previously transferred tokens not being accounted for. This could allow the owner to transfer more tokens than are actually available, as the check only considers current balances rather than total possible locked balances.",
