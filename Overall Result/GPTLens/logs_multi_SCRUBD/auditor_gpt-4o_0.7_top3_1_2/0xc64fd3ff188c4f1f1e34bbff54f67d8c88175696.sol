        "vulnerability": "lack_of_approval_race_condition_prevention",
        "reason": "The approve function is susceptible to the well-known 'race condition' vulnerability, where an attacker can potentially exploit the time gap between setting an allowance and spending it. This can lead to scenarios where an attacker might spend more tokens than intended if the allowed value is changed before the spender uses it. This vulnerability can be mitigated by implementing the 'increaseApproval' and 'decreaseApproval' pattern, which is partially implemented in this contract.",

        "vulnerability": "burn_without_balance_check",
        "reason": "The burn function lacks a check to ensure that the sender has a sufficient balance to burn the specified amount of tokens. This could potentially allow a user to reduce the total supply of tokens more than they actually own, which could disrupt the tokenomics and lead to unexpected behavior.",

        "vulnerability": "transfer_possible_during_minting",
        "reason": "The transfer function in the CrowdfundableToken contract includes a restriction that prevents transfers unless minting is finished. This limitation could be exploited if there is any way to bypass the mintingFinished check or if minting is never finished, effectively locking users' tokens. This can lead to user dissatisfaction and potential financial loss if not managed properly.",
