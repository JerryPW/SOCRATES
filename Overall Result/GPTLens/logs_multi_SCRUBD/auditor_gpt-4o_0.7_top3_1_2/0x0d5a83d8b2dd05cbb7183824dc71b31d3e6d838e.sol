        "vulnerability": "Fee Manipulation by Owner",

        "reason": "The `renounceOwnership` function allows the owner to set the contract owner to the zero address, effectively making certain functions that require `onlyOwner` modifier unusable.

        "vulnerability": "Allowance Double-Spend",
        "reason": "The `transferFrom` function does not protect against the re-entrancy attack pattern, where an attacker could potentially call the function multiple times before the allowance deduction is completed. Although Solidity 0.8.x includes built-in overflow checks, the pattern could still lead to unexpected behaviors if not carefully handled.",
