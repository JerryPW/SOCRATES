        "vulnerability": "Potential loss of ownership control",
        "reason": "The `renounceOwnership` function allows the current owner to set the owner address to the zero address, effectively making the contract ownerless. If executed, this action is irreversible and could result in the inability to perform any owner-restricted actions, such as setting the bots or enabling trading. Making the contract ownerless could be exploited by an attacker to freeze the contract's functionality, especially if critical functions are gated by the onlyOwner modifier.",

        "reason": "The `setBots` function allows the owner to mark any address as a bot, effectively blacklisting it from trading. While the function is restricted to the owner, if the owner's private key is compromised or if the owner is malicious, they can prevent legitimate users from participating in trading by adding their addresses to the bots mapping.",

        "reason": "The `manualswap` function allows the address `_feeAddrWallet1` to trigger a swap of all tokens held by the contract for ETH. This centralized control means that `_feeAddrWallet1` can decide when and how often to perform the swap, potentially impacting token price and liquidity. If this wallet is compromised, an attacker could manipulate the swap frequency for personal gain.",
