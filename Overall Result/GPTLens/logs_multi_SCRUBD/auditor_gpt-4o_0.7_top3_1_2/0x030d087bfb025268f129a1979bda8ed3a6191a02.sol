        "vulnerability": "Excess Token Drain by Owner",
        "reason": "The `owner_rescueTokens` function allows the contract owner to transfer any tokens held by the contract that exceed the pending tax tokens to the marketing wallet. This means the owner can drain excess tokens from the contract, which could include tokens sent by mistake or tokens meant to be locked for a different purpose. This creates a centralization risk and potential for abuse by the owner.",

        "vulnerability": "Manipulation of Watchdog Timer",
        "reason": "The `owner_setDogSellTimeForAddress` function allows the contract owner to arbitrarily set the 'dog sell time' for any address. This can be used to manipulate trading by restricting or allowing sales for specific addresses, potentially impacting the token's market dynamics and fairness. It also introduces a centralization risk where the owner can favor certain addresses over others.",

        "vulnerability": "Unchecked Allowance Decrease",
        "reason": "In the `transferFrom` function, the allowance is decreased using subtraction without checking for underflow conditions. Although Solidity 0.8+ includes overflow and underflow checks, explicitly ensuring that the allowance is sufficient before performing subtraction can prevent potential logical errors and is considered a best practice for security.",
