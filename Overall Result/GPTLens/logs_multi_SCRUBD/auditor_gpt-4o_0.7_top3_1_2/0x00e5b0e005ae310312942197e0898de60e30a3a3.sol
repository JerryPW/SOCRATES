        "vulnerability": "Permanent Loss of Ownership Control",
        "reason": "This function allows the current owner to renounce ownership, which sets the owner to the zero address. Once this is done, no one can call functions protected by the onlyOwner modifier, potentially leaving the contract in a state that can't be modified or controlled further. This can be particularly problematic if critical functions require owner access. It is exploitable by an attacker if the owner can be tricked into executing this function.",

        "vulnerability": "Centralized Control Risk",
        "reason": "This function allows the owner to mark any address as a bot, which can prevent those addresses from interacting with the contract. This introduces a centralized control point, making the system less decentralized and open to potential abuse by a malicious owner. An attacker, if acquiring owner rights, could use this to block legitimate users.",

        "reason": "This function allows the team address to manually send all ETH held by the contract to the predefined team and marketing addresses. If the team address's private key is compromised or if the function is executed inappropriately, it could lead to unauthorized withdrawal of funds.
