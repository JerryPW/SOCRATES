        "vulnerability": "Reentrancy vulnerability",
        "reason": "The Collect function transfers ether to the caller using msg.sender.call.value(_am)() without following the checks-effects-interactions pattern.

        "vulnerability": "Potential DoS with Block Gas Limit",
        "reason": "The Put function writes to the storage with every call (LogFile.AddMessage), which can increase storage use and eventually reach the block gas limit, making the function unusable. This could be exploited by an attacker to fill up storage with unnecessary data, especially since there's no limit on the number of messages added to the log.",
