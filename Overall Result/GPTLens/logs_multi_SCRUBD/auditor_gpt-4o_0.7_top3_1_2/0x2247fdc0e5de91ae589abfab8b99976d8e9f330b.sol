        "vulnerability": "Owner can drain all contract funds",
        "reason": "The `exitScam` function allows the contract owner to transfer the entire balance of the contract to themselves. This is a critical vulnerability as it enables the contract owner to perform a rug pull, stealing all the funds deposited by participants. While the function is protected by `onlyOwner`, it still poses a significant risk since the owner can execute it at any time.",

        "vulnerability": "Reentrancy attack through external call",
        "reason": "The `payout` function makes an external call using `call.value().gas()`, which sends Ether to a participant. This external call allows for reentrancy, enabling a malicious participant to re-enter the contract and manipulate the state or drain funds. This can be exploited if the recipient contract has a fallback function that calls `payout` again before the balance updates are completed, potentially draining the contract.",

        "vulnerability": "Ownership transfer can be hijacked",
        "reason": "The `acceptOwnership` function requires the caller to be the `ownerCandidate`, but it does not reset `ownerCandidate` after ownership transfer. This means if `ownerCandidate` is mistakenly set to an attacker-controlled address, the attacker can claim ownership without any further restrictions. This could allow an attacker to gain control over the contract, including the ability to call `exitScam` and withdraw all funds.",
