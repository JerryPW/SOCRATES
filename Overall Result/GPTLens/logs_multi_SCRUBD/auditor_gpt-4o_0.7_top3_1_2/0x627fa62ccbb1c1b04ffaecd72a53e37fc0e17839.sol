        "reason": "The function uses 'call' to interact with external tokens, which is unsafe because it doesn't verify if the call executed successfully. It may lead to unexpected behavior or security risks if the token contract does not implement the 'transfer' function as expected or if it reverts for some reason.",

        "reason": "The 'confirmOwner' function allows a new owner to be set without any further checks or confirmations after 'changeOwner' is called. If 'newOwner' is set to an unintended address due to a mistake or malicious intent, it can lead to unauthorized ownership change.",

        "vulnerability": "Reentrancy vulnerability",
        "reason": "The function uses 'call.value()' to transfer Ether, which allows the receiving address to call back into the contract and potentially exploit it. Since the state update 'Holders[_addr]-=_wei;' happens after the Ether is sent, an attacker could re-enter the contract and manipulate the balance.",
