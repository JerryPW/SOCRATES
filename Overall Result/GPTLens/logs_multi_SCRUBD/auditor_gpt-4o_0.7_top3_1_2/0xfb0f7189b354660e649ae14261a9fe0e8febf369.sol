        "reason": "The transferOwnership function allows the current owner to transfer ownership of the contract to a new owner. However, there is no check to ensure that the new owner address is not the zero address (0x0). This can lead to the contract being unintentionally or maliciously locked, as no one would then have the authority to perform owner-only actions.",

        "vulnerability": "Potential loss of tokens",
        "reason": "The collectBack function transfers all remaining tokens to the collectorAddress and sets totalCandyNo to 0. However, if the token transfer fails for any reason (e.g., due to lack of gas or a revert in the token contract), totalCandyNo would still be set to 0, indicating that all tokens have been collected while they actually remain locked in the contract.",
