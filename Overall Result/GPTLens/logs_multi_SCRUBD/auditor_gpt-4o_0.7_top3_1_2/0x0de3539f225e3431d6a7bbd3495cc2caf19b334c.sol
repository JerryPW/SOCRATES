        "reason": "The function allows the owner to renounce ownership, which sets the owner to the zero address. This is a severe issue because once ownership is renounced, no one can perform owner-only functions, which might be required for critical updates or functions. This can lead to the contract being unmanageable and potentially locking funds or other functionalities permanently.",

        "reason": "The manualswap function allows a specific address (_feeAddrWallet1) to swap all tokens held by the contract for ETH.

        "vulnerability": "Centralized ETH transfer control",
        "reason": "Similar to manualswap, the manualsend function gives _feeAddrWallet1 the ability to transfer all ETH held by the contract to itself and another wallet.
