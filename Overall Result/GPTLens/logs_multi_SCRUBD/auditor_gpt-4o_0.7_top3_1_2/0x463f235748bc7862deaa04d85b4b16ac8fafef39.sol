        "vulnerability": "Reentrancy",
        "reason": "The CashOut function is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack because it uses the low-level call method to send ether to the caller. This allows a malicious contract to repeatedly call back into the CashOut function before the balance is updated, resulting in funds being drained from the contract.",

        "reason": "The constructor allows specifying an arbitrary address for the TransferLog contract.
