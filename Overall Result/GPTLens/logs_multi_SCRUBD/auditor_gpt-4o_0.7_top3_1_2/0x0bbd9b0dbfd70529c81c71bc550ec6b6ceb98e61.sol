        "reason": "This function allows the current owner to renounce ownership, which sets the owner to the zero address. Once called, no one can call functions with the `onlyOwner` modifier, potentially leaving the contract in a state where it cannot be upgraded, have parameters adjusted, or recover from errors.",

        "reason": "The function enables trading without any restriction on `botBlocks`, which means the owner can manipulate the number of blocks considered as bot blocks. This could lead to arbitrary accounts being flagged as bots during the initial trading period, potentially blocking legitimate users and enabling unfair practices.",
