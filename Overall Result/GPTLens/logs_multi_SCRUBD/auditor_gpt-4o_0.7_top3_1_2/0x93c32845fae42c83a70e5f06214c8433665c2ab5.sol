        "vulnerability": "Reentrancy vulnerability",

        "vulnerability": "Insecure balance handling",
        "reason": "The function allows adding funds with an arbitrary '_unlockTime'. If an attacker can influence the 'now' value (albeit difficult), they could potentially withdraw funds prematurely. Furthermore, using 'var' with 'Acc[msg.sender]' may lead to unexpected behavior due to type inference issues in older Solidity versions.",
