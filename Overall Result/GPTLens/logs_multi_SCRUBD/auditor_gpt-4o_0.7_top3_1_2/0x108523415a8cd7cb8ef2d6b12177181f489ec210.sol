        "vulnerability": "Ownership can be renounced irrevocably",
        "reason": "The `renounceOwnership` function allows the current owner to renounce ownership and set the owner address to zero address (address(0)). This action is irreversible and makes the contract without an owner, which means that any function protected by the `onlyOwner` modifier will no longer be callable, potentially leaving critical functions inaccessible. This can lead to a loss of control over the contract settings and functions that require ownership privileges.",

        "reason": "The `removeStuckEth` function allows the owner to withdraw any Ether sent to the contract. While this function is protected by the `onlyOwner` modifier, it can be misused if the owner is malicious or if the ownership is compromised. This could lead to a situation where users who sent Ether to the contract mistakenly or for specific purposes could lose their funds permanently.",

        "vulnerability": "Potential denial of service (DoS) by setting high gas limit",
        "reason": "The `setDistributorSettings` function allows the owner to set the gas limit for the dividend distributor process. Although there is a check to ensure the gas limit is below 750,000, setting this value too high could still cause issues with transaction execution and lead to a denial of service (DoS) in the dividend processing. This could prevent dividends from being processed efficiently, affecting all shareholders.",
