        "reason": "The renounceOwnership function allows the current owner to set the owner to the zero address, effectively making the contract ownerless. Once ownership is renounced, no one can call onlyOwner functions, which can lead to loss of control over critical functions like cashOut, potentially resulting in locked funds.",

        "vulnerability": "Unlimited token allowance",
        "reason": "The constructor sets an unlimited allowance for the Uniswap contract with setAllowance(_uniswapAddress, uint256(-1)).
