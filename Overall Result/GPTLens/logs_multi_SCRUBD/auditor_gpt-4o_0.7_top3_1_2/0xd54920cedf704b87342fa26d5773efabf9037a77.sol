        "reason": "The withdraw function is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack because it updates the user's pending withdrawals balance after sending the amount.

If maxForThisRun is set too high, it could lead to excessive gas consumption and potentially cause the transaction to fail. This loop-based approach is not gas efficient and can lead to denial of service if the gas cost exceeds the block gas limit.",
