        "reason": "The function calls an external contract's transfer function before updating the SellAmount state variable. This can be exploited if the token contract's transfer function allows for reentrancy, enabling an attacker to repeatedly call buyTokens before the state is updated, potentially acquiring more tokens than intended.",
