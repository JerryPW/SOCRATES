        "reason": "The `transferFrom` function does not protect against the race condition known as 'allowance double-spend.' If an allowance is modified by the spender before the `transferFrom` call is completed, it might allow them to spend more tokens than originally intended. This is commonly mitigated by using the 'checks-effects-interactions' pattern or by first setting the allowance to zero and then to the new value.",
