        "reason": "The withdraw function is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. It transfers Ether to msg.sender before setting their balance to 0. An attacker could exploit this by calling withdraw() from a contract with a fallback function that calls withdraw() again, allowing them to drain the contract's funds.",

        "vulnerability": "Forced Ether send",

        "reason": "When bought_tokens is true, the fallback function attempts to transfer tokens based on balances[msg.sender] * 100 without considering the actual token balance of the contract. If the calculated token amount exceeds the contract's token balance, the ERC20 transfer call will fail, preventing users from receiving their tokens and potentially causing loss of funds.",
