        "vulnerability": "Improper end_time assignment",
        "reason": "The 'end_time' is set directly to the 'lockTime' provided by the owner. This allows the owner to set an arbitrary end time, including one that is in the past, which could immediately trigger the lock as complete, bypassing the intended lock duration. This vulnerability can be exploited by the owner to release tokens prematurely.",

        "vulnerability": "No validation of token_reward contract",
        "reason": "The contract assumes that 'token_reward' adheres to a standard token interface which supports 'transfer'. If a malicious or non-standard contract is used as 'token_reward', it could prevent tokens from being transferred properly or execute unintended code. This assumption without validation could be exploited by deploying a non-standard token contract to manipulate 'release' behavior.",

        "reason": "The ownership transfer relies entirely on a single transaction without any two-step process or confirmation mechanism. If the owner's private key is compromised, an attacker can transfer ownership immediately, taking full control of the contract.
