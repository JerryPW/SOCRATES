        "vulnerability": "Lack of input validation",
        "reason": "The buyTicket function does not validate msg.value to ensure that the amount being sent to purchase a ticket is correct. This could allow an attacker to send a very small amount of ether to register as a participant without paying the full ticket price, resulting in a financial loss for the event organizer.",

        "vulnerability": "Unsafe use of send",
        "reason": "The refundTicket function uses send to transfer ether, which only forwards 2300 gas and may fail if the recipient is a contract with a fallback function that requires more gas. This can lead to situations where the refund does not execute as expected, leaving the contract in an inconsistent state without proper error handling.",

        "reason": "The destroy function can be called by the organizer at any time, which can result in the contract being terminated unexpectedly. If the organizer's account is compromised, an attacker could destroy the contract, seizing control over the remaining balance, and disrupting the service for all participants.",
