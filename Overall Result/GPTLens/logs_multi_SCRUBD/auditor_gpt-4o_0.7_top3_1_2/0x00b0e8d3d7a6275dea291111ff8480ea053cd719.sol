        "vulnerability": "Ownership cannot be recovered",
        "reason": "The renounceOwnership function sets the owner to the zero address, effectively leaving the contract without an owner. This can be problematic because it means that no one will be able to execute functions that are restricted to the owner, such as opening trading or managing bots, potentially leading to a situation where certain functionalities become permanently inaccessible.",

        "vulnerability": "Potential misuse of manual swap function",
        "reason": "The manualswap function allows an external call to trigger the swap of all contract tokens for ETH, but is restricted to _feeAddrWallet1. If the private key for _feeAddrWallet1 is compromised, an attacker could continually trigger token swaps at inopportune times, possibly causing significant market impact or loss of value for token holders.",

        "vulnerability": "Open trading without security checks",
        "reason": "The openTrading function enables trading by setting various parameters and adding liquidity. However, it does not include any checks or precautions to protect against potential front-running or bot attacks that can occur when a new token is listed. Without measures like an initial trading delay or anti-sniping mechanisms, this function could lead to significant losses for initial investors.",
