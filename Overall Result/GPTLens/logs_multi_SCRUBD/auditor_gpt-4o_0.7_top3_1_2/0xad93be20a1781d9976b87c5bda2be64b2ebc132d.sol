        "vulnerability": "Unsafe Ether transfer to owner",
        "reason": "The withdraw function uses the send method to transfer Ether to the contract owner. The send method only forwards 2300 gas, which may be insufficient for the recipient's fallback function, potentially causing the transaction to fail. Additionally, the function does not check the return value of send, which can lead to Ether being stuck in the contract if the transfer fails.",

        "vulnerability": "Lack of input validation",
        "reason": "The transfer function does not validate the input parameters adequately. Specifically, it does not check if the 'to' address is valid (i.e., not the zero address). This can lead to tokens being 'burned' if sent to the zero address, which is typically not desired behavior.",

        "vulnerability": "Lack of input validation",
        "reason": "Similar to the transfer function, the transferFrom function does not check if the 'to' address is valid (i.e., not the zero address).
