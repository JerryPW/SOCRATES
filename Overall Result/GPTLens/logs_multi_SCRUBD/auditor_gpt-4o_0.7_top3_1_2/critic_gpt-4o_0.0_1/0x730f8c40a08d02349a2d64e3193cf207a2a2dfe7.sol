The balance is updated after the external call, which allows an attacker to re-enter the function and drain funds before the balance is updated. This is a classic reentrancy pattern. The severity is high because it can lead to a complete loss of funds from the contract. The profitability is also high for an attacker who can exploit this vulnerability.",
