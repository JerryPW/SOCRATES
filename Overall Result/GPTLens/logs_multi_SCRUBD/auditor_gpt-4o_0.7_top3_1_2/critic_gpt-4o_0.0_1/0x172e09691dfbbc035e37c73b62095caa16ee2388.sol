However, the function does not use call.value(), but rather send, which is less susceptible to reentrancy as it only forwards 2300 gas. The checks-effects-interactions pattern is not strictly followed, which could lead to state inconsistencies if reentrancy occurs. The severity is moderate because reentrancy could lead to incorrect state changes, but the profitability is low due to the use of send.",
