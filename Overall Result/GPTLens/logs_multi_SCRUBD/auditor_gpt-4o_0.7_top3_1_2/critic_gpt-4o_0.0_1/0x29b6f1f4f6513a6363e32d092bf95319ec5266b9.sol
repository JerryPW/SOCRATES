        "criticism": "The reasoning is correct in identifying that the function allows the current marketing wallet to change the address without additional checks. This could be a significant vulnerability if the private key of the marketing wallet is compromised. However, the function does require the caller to be the current marketing wallet, which provides a layer of security. The severity is moderate because it depends on the security of the marketing wallet's private key. The profitability is moderate as well, as an attacker with access to the private key could redirect funds.",

This is a common risk in owner-controlled functions. The severity is high because the treasury typically holds significant funds, and changing its address could lead to a total loss of those funds.
