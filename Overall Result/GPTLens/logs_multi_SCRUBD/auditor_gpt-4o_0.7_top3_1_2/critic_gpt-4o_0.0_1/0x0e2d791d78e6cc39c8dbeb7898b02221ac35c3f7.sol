The check for the max wallet count is only applied when adding a new wallet, not when updating an existing wallet's allocation. This could indeed allow the owner to circumvent the intended limit by first setting allocations to zero and then updating them back to non-zero. The severity is moderate as it could lead to an unintended increase in the number of tax wallets, potentially affecting the contract's behavior. The profitability is low because this vulnerability primarily benefits the contract owner rather than an external attacker.",
