        "criticism": "The reasoning is correct. The use of blockhash for generating secrets is a well-known vulnerability because miners can influence the block hash to some extent, especially if the reward is significant. This predictability allows attackers to exploit the system by determining when the secret will be a multiple of 5. The severity is high because it compromises the fairness of the function, and the profitability is also high as it allows attackers to become winners and potentially claim rewards.",

        "severity": 8,
        "profitability": 8,
        "reason": "The secret is generated using the block hash of the previous block, which can be manipulated or predicted by miners. This allows an attacker to predict when the secret will be a multiple of 5, and thus become the winner, exploiting the predictability of the secret generation process.",

This is particularly dangerous if combined with the predictable secret generation vulnerability, as it allows an attacker to drain the contract's funds. The severity is high because it can lead to a complete loss of funds, and the profitability is also high for the attacker.",

However, the severity and profitability depend on how the seed values are used in the contract.
