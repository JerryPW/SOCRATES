However, the likelihood of a reentrancy attack depends on the implementation of addLiquidity and whether it allows reentrant calls. The severity is moderate because if reentrancy is possible, it could lead to significant issues like unauthorized state changes. The profitability is moderate as well, as an attacker could potentially exploit this to manipulate contract state or drain funds.",
