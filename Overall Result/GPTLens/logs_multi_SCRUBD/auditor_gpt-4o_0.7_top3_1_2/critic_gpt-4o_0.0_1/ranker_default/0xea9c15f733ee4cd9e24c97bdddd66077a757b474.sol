        "criticism": "The reasoning is correct. The 'exitScam' function allows the contract owner to transfer all the contract's balance to their own address, enabling a potential rug pull. This is a significant risk for participants as it allows the owner to defraud them and take all funds. The severity is high because it can lead to a total loss of funds for participants. The profitability is also high for the owner, who can exploit this function.",
