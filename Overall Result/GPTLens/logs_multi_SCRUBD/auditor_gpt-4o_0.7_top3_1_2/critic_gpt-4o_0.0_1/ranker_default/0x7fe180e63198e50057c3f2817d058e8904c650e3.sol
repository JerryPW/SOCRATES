This can lead to the contract being terminated unexpectedly, resulting in a complete loss of funds and service disruption. The severity is very high due to the potential for total contract destruction.

This is a significant issue as it directly impacts the financial integrity of the contract. The severity is high because it can lead to financial losses for the event organizer.

This can indeed lead to failed transactions if the recipient is a contract with a complex fallback function.
