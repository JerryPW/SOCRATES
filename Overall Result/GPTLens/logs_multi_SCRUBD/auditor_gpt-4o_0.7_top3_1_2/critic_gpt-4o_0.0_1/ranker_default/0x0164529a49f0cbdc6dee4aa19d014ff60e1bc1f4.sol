This is a design decision rather than a vulnerability. The severity is moderate because it depends on the trustworthiness of the deployer and the security of their account.

The function manualSnipeBots calls snipeBalances, which could potentially be abused to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) if there is no mechanism to limit its usage. However, the severity of this vulnerability depends on the implementation of snipeBalances and whether it has any gas-intensive operations. Without further details on snipeBalances, the severity and profitability are speculative.

The ETH transfer occurs after the token swap, and the function does not call any external contracts after transferring ETH.
