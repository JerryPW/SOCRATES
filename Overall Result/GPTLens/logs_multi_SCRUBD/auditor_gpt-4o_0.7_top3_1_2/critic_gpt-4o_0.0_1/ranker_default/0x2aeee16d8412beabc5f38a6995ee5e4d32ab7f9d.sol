However, the function does include a check to prevent the tax from exceeding 35%, which is a safeguard against excessively high fees. The severity is moderate because it can affect user trust and trading activity, but it is not an immediate security risk.

Although there's a check that prevents the tax from exceeding 35%, setting taxes up to this maximum can still significantly hinder trading for users, making the token less attractive and potentially leading to a loss of user trust.
