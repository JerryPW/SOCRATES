This could defraud participants who have sent ETH to the contract. The severity is high because it directly affects the trust and financial interests of participants.

This could indeed make the contract vulnerable to manipulation or front-running attacks. The severity is moderate to high because removing these limits can expose the contract to various risks, but the profitability is low for external attackers unless they can exploit the lack of limits in a specific scenario.",

If the `_owner` address is not securely controlled, it could lead to potential security issues. However, this is more of a design decision rather than a direct vulnerability, as it depends on the security practices of the contract owner. The severity is moderate because it could lead to significant issues if mishandled, but the profitability for an external attacker is low unless they can compromise the `_owner` address.",
