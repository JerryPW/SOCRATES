This is a significant issue as it undermines the integrity of the crowdsale, allowing the beneficiary to receive free tokens. The severity is high because it directly impacts the fairness and expected behavior of the crowdsale.

This is a critical issue as it prevents any contributions from being made, effectively making the contract unusable for its intended purpose.

The use of 'send' to transfer ether, which only forwards 2300 gas, can lead to failed transfers without reverting the transaction. The function updates 'amountRemaining' to 0 only after a successful send, which could lead to inconsistencies if the call fails. This is a common vulnerability pattern that can lead to unexpected behavior. The severity is moderate because it can cause inconsistencies, but it does not directly lead to a loss of funds.
