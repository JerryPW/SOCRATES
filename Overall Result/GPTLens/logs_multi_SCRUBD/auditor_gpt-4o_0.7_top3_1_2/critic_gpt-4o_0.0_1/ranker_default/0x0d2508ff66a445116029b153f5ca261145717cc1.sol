The function does have a conditional check that could be bypassed if `m_DidDeploy` is false, allowing any owner to modify allocations without verifying the caller's identity.

However, the use of `transfer` mitigates reentrancy risks because it only forwards 2300 gas, which is not enough to perform a reentrant call. The severity is low because the use of `transfer` inherently limits reentrancy. The profitability is also low because exploiting this would require a specific setup and the attacker would not gain significant funds.",

        "reason": "The function `payTaxes` includes a call to an external contract via the `transfer` method, followed by another external call to `External.deposit` without using a reentrancy guard.
