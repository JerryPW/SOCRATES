This could be abused to prematurely end campaigns and return tokens. The severity is high because it undermines the integrity of the campaign process. The profitability is high as well, as it allows the owner to manipulate campaign outcomes for financial gain.",

However, the vulnerability is not directly within the createCampaign function itself but rather in the ERC20 standard's design. The severity is moderate because front-running can lead to token loss, but it requires specific conditions to be met. The profitability is moderate as well, as an attacker could potentially deplete tokens if they act quickly.",
