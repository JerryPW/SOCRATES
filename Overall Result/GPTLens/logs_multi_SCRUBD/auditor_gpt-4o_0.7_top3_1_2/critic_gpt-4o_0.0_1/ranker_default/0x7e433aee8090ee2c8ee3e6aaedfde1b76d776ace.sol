The function assumes 'token_reward' adheres to a standard interface without validation, which could lead to issues if a non-standard or malicious contract is used.

If a malicious or non-standard contract is used as 'token_reward', it could prevent tokens from being transferred properly or execute unintended code. This assumption without validation could be exploited by deploying a non-standard token contract to manipulate 'release' behavior.",

However, this is a design decision rather than a vulnerability, as the function is restricted to the owner.

This vulnerability can be exploited by the owner to release tokens prematurely.",
