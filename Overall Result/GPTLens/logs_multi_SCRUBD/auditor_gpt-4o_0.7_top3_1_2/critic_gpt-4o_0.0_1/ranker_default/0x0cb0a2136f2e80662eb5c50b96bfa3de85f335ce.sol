This is a significant vulnerability if the icebox address is compromised or misconfigured, as it can lead to inflation and devaluation of the token.

This is a design decision rather than a vulnerability, as it is expected behavior for an owner-controlled function. However, if ownership is compromised, it could lead to a complete loss of funds.
