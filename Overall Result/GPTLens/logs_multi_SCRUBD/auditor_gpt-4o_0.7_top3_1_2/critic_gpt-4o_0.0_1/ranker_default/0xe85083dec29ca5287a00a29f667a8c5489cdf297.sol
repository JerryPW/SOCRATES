This is a classic reentrancy issue where an attacker could potentially re-enter the function and manipulate the state to their advantage.

This can indeed lead to a situation where the spender might exploit the timing to use both the old and new allowances.

By simply decrementing the index without rearranging the list, the function can leave gaps and stale entries, leading to inconsistencies.
