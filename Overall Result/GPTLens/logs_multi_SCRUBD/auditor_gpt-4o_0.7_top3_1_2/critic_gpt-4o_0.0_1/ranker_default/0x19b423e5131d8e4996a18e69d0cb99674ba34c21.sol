This could lead to high transaction fees, effectively draining funds. The severity is high because it can directly impact users' funds. The profitability is also high for a malicious actor with authorization, as they can set fees to siphon off funds.",

However, this is a common design choice in many contracts and not inherently a vulnerability. The severity is moderate because it depends on the owner's security practices. The profitability is low because an external attacker cannot directly exploit this unless they have already compromised the owner's account.",
