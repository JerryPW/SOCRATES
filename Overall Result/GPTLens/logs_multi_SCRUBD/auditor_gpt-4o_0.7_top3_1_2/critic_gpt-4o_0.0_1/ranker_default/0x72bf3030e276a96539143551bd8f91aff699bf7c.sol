The use of the onlyCurator modifier does provide access control, but if the curator is compromised or inactive, it could indeed prevent updates to the curator address. However, this is more of a design limitation rather than a direct vulnerability. The lack of validation for the new curator address is a valid concern, as it could lead to setting an invalid address. The severity is moderate because it can lead to governance issues, but it does not directly affect the contract's financial state.
