The severity is moderate because reentrancy can lead to significant losses if exploited. The profitability is high for an attacker if they can successfully exploit this vulnerability to drain tokens.",

Using 'send' to transfer Ether is indeed unsafe due to the limited gas stipend, which can cause transactions to fail if the recipient's fallback function requires more gas.
