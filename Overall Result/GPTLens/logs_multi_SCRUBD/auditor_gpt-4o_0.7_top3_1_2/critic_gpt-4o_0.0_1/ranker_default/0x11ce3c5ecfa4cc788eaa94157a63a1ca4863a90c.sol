This can lead to unexpected interactions with other contracts relying on ERC165 interface support checks.

The function attempts to approve ERC20 tokens from the contract's own balance, which may not have the intended effect unless a proper allowance setup is in place. However, the function does not inherently allow for manipulation by external contracts, as the approval is limited to the contract itself.

The concern about transferring Ether before updating the state is valid in general, but the nonReentrant modifier should mitigate this risk.
