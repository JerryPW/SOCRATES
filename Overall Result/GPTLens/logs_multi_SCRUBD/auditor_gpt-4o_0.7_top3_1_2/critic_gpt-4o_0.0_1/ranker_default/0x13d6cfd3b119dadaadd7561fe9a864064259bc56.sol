However, the use of 'send' with its limited gas stipend does mitigate the risk to some extent, as it prevents complex reentrant calls. Nonetheless, the vulnerability still exists and could be exploited if the attacker finds a way to reenter the function. The severity is moderate due to the potential for fund drainage, and the profitability is high if exploited successfully.",
