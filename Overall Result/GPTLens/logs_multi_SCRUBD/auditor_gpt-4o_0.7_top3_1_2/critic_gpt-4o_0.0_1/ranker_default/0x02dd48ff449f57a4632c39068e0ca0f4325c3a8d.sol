While it is true that the balance is updated before the logging operation, the primary concern should be whether the logging operation can fail and revert the transaction. In Solidity, if a function call fails, it reverts the entire transaction, including state changes. Therefore, the state inconsistency described is unlikely to occur unless the logging function is designed to handle exceptions improperly.
