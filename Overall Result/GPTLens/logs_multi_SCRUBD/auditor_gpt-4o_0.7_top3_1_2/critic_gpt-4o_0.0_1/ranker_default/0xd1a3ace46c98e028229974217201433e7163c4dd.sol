However, the use of transfer() itself is generally considered safe against re-entrancy because it forwards a limited amount of gas, preventing further calls. The real risk comes from the thankYou function in the HelpMeToken contracts, which could be malicious. The severity is moderate because it depends on the behavior of external contracts.
