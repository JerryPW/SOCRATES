This could indeed lead to unauthorized sales if the token ownership has changed without updating the listing. The severity is moderate because it can lead to unauthorized sales, but it requires specific conditions to be met. The profitability is moderate as well, as an attacker could potentially exploit this to purchase tokens they should not be able to.",
