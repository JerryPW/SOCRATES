This can lead to unauthorized access and control over functions that rely on the OwnerO address, potentially leading to fund mismanagement or unauthorized actions by attackers. The severity is high because it can lead to a complete takeover of the contract. The profitability is also high because an attacker can gain control over the contract and potentially steal funds or perform unauthorized actions.",

The use of the send function is unsafe because it only forwards 2300 gas, which may not be sufficient if the recipient is a contract with a fallback function requiring more gas. Additionally, there is no check on the return value of send, which means failed transactions due to insufficient gas or other issues won't revert the state, potentially leading to inconsistent balances. The severity is moderate because it can lead to loss of funds or inconsistent state.
