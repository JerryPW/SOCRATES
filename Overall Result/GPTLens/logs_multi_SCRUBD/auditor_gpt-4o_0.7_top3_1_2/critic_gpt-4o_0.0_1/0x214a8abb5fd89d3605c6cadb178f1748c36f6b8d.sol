This is a design decision rather than a vulnerability, as the function is explicitly marked with 'onlyOwner', indicating that this behavior is intentional.

The profitability is also low for external attackers, as only the owner can execute this function.",

        "reason": "The `withdrawStuckETH` function allows the owner to withdraw all the ETH balance of the contract. This means that if ETH is sent to the contract either accidentally or as part of some operation, the owner can extract all of it, potentially leaving the contract without any ETH for operational costs like gas refunds during token transfers.",
