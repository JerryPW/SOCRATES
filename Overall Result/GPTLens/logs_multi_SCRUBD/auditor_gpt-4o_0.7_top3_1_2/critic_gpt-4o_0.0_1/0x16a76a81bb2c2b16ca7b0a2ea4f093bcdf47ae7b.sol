However, the function does not directly allow reentrancy on the same function call, as the swap and send operations are separate from the main transfer logic. The severity is moderate because reentrancy could be exploited if the swapTokensForEth or sendETHToTeam functions are vulnerable. The profitability is moderate as well, as an attacker could potentially manipulate the contract's ETH balance.",
