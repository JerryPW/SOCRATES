The function is marked as internal and onlyOwner, which limits its exposure. Additionally, the function does not transfer Ether or interact with external contracts, which are typical vectors for reentrancy attacks. The concern about the owner being a contract is valid, but it does not inherently lead to reentrancy in this context.",

Though the function uses `onlyOwner`, if the owner is a contract, and it can call back into `setTaxAlloc`, the state variables can be manipulated unexpectedly.",
