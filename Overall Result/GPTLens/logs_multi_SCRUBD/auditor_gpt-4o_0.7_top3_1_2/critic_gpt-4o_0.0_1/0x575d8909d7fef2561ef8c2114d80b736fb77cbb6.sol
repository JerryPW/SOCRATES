This is a well-known issue in ERC20 tokens where a spender can exploit the timing of transactions to use both the old and new allowance. The severity is moderate because it can lead to unexpected token transfers, but it requires specific timing to exploit. The profitability is moderate as well, as an attacker could potentially double-spend the allowance.",
