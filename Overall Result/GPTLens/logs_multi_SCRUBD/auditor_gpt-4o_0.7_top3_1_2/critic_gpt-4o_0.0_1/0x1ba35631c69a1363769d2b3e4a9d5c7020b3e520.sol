However, the claim that an attacker could exploit this inefficiency to drain funds via gas fees is somewhat overstated. While frequent rebalancing can indeed lead to inefficiencies and increased costs, it is typically the contract owner or authorized entity that triggers such functions, not an external attacker. Therefore, the profitability for an attacker is low. The severity is moderate as it affects the contract's operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness.",
