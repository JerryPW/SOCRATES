In Solidity versions prior to 0.8.0, integer operations do not automatically check for overflow, which can lead to unexpected behavior. However, the impact of this overflow is limited to the computation of the address, which is then used in a send operation. The severity is moderate because it could lead to unintended address computations, but the profitability is low as it does not directly allow an attacker to gain control over funds.",

        "reason": "The function sol_clean does not have any checks for integer overflow. In Solidity version 0.4.4, integer operations do not throw an overflow/underflow exception. Therefore, the operation x = x + s can lead to an overflow, causing x to wrap around to 0.
