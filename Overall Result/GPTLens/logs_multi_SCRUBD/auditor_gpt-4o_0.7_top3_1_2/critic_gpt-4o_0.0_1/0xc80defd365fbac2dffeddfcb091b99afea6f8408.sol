The repeated use of call without checking return values or implementing reentrancy guards can be exploited by a malicious contract to reenter the function or consume excessive gas, leading to denial of service.

Without any restrictions or checks, a malicious contract could exploit this by reentering the `getTokens` function or causing excessive gas consumption leading to denial of service.
