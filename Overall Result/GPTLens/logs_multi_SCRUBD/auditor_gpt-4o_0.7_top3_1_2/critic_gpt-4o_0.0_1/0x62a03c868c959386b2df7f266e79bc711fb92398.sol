This behavior indeed makes the _owner parameter useless and always assigns ownership to the deployer of the contract. While this might not be the intended behavior, it does not introduce a security vulnerability per se, as the ownership is still controlled by the deployer. The severity is low because it does not lead to a security breach, but rather a potential design flaw. The profitability is also low as it does not provide an opportunity for exploitation.",
