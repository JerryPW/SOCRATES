This could mislead developers or users into thinking the state is being updated when it is not.

This allows for a potential reentrancy attack where an attacker could re-enter the function and manipulate the state (e.g., by resetting the price) before the initial execution completes. This can be exploited to withdraw more funds than intended. To mitigate this, the state should be updated before the external call, or the 'checks-effects-interactions' pattern should be followed.",
