This can indeed lead to funds being stuck in the contract. The suggestion to use `transfer` or `call` with proper checks is valid. However, the severity is moderate because it depends on the recipient's fallback function, and the profitability is low as it doesn't directly benefit an attacker.",

This could lead to funds being stuck in the contract as the `send` call fails silently without reverting the transaction. Using `transfer` or `call` with proper checks is safer.",

This could allow a malicious recipient to exploit the contract by re-entering the `payInterest` function before the state is updated.
