However, the claim of overflow is not substantiated by the code provided, as Solidity handles arithmetic operations with overflow checks in newer versions. The severity is moderate because high fees can deter users, but the profitability for an attacker is low since they cannot directly exploit this for financial gain.",

Additionally, such high fees can discourage legitimate users and could be exploited by an attacker who manipulates the fee structure.",
