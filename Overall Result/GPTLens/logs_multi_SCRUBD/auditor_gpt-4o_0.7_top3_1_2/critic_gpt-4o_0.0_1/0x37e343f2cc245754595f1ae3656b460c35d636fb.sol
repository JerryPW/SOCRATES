The OwnershipTransferred event is emitted with incorrect data because the newOwnerCandidate is reset to address(0) before the event is emitted. This could lead to confusion in tracking ownership changes. However, this issue does not affect the actual ownership transfer logic, which is correctly implemented. The severity is low as it does not impact the contract's functionality, and the profitability is also low since it does not provide any financial gain to an attacker.",

This is a significant security oversight, as it allows manipulation of the contract's state by unauthorized entities.

This can lead to inconsistencies between the blockchain state and off-chain records, which rely on events for tracking. The severity is moderate because it affects the reliability of event-based tracking systems, but it does not directly impact the contract's core functionality.
