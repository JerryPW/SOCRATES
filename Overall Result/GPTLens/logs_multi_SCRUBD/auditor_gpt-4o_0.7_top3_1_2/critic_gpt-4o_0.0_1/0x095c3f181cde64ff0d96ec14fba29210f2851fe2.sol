The constructor does not explicitly check if the initial owner is whitelisted, which could potentially allow a non-whitelisted address to control the crowdsale. However, this depends on the implementation of the setWhitelistContract function and the overall design of the contract. If the whitelist logic is enforced elsewhere, this might not be a critical issue. The severity is moderate as it could undermine the whitelist mechanism, but the profitability is low since it requires specific conditions to be met.",

The function only updates internal state variables and emits an event.
