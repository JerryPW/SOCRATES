The function sends tokens to the caller before updating the state variables, which can be exploited by an attacker to reenter the contract and claim more tokens than intended. This is a classic reentrancy issue, similar to the one seen in the DAO hack. The severity is high because it can lead to significant financial loss by depleting the contract's token reserves.

The function does allow the owner to withdraw all Ether from the contract, but this is a common pattern in smart contracts where the owner has control over the funds.
