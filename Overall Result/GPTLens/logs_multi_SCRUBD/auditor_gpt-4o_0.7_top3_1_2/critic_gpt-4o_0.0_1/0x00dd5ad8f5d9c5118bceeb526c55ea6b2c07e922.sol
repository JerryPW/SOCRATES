The function does allow the owner to set the marketing wallet to any non-contract address, which could be a malicious address controlled by the owner. However, this is a design decision rather than a vulnerability, as the owner is expected to act in the best interest of the contract. The severity is low because it relies on the owner's malicious intent, which is a risk inherent in any contract with owner privileges. The profitability is also low for external attackers, as they cannot exploit this without being the owner.",
