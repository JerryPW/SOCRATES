This can indeed cause transfers to fail if the recipient is a contract that requires more gas to execute its fallback or receive function.

If any recipient is a contract that requires more than 2300 gas to execute its fallback/receive function, the transfer will fail, potentially leaving the contract in an unexpected state. This could be exploited by an attacker to block further transactions or cause unintended behavior, especially if the system depends on these transfers succeeding.",

This can result in loss of funds or inconsistent states, especially if the contract logic assumes all transfers succeed.

In Solidity, '.send()' returns a boolean indicating success or failure, but the current implementation ignores this. If a transfer fails due to any reason (e.g., running out of gas or rejection by the recipient), this could lead to loss of funds or inconsistent states without any alert to the contract owner or users. Attackers could exploit this by ensuring some transfers fail deliberately.",
