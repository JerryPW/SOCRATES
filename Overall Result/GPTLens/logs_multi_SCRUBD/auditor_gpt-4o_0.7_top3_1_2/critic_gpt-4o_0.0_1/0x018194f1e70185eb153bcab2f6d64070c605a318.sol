        "criticism": "The reasoning is correct. The absence of an onlyOwner modifier allows any user to call the function and transfer excess tokens to the marketing address. This is a significant vulnerability as it can lead to unauthorized token transfers, effectively draining the contract's token balance. The severity is high because it compromises the security of the contract's funds. The profitability is also high since an attacker can directly benefit by transferring tokens to an address they control.",

While the function does send ETH to the marketing address, the risk of reentrancy is mitigated by the fact that the function is marked as private and uses a lockTheSwap modifier, which likely prevents reentrant calls. However, if the marketing address is a contract, it could still execute code upon receiving ETH. The severity is moderate due to the potential for reentrancy, but the profitability is low as exploiting this would require specific conditions and the ability to reenter the contract.",
