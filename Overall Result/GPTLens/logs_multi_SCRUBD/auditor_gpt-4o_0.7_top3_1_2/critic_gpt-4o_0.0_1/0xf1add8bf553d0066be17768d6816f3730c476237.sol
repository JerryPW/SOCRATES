This can lead to silent failures if the recipient contract requires more gas to execute its fallback function. The severity is moderate because it can lead to loss of ether if not handled properly, but it does not allow for direct exploitation by an attacker. The profitability is low as an attacker cannot directly profit from this vulnerability.",
