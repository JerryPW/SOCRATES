This could lead to a situation where the transfer fails, but the function still returns true, misleading the user into thinking the transaction was successful. This can result in a loss of funds for the user. The severity is moderate because it can cause financial loss, and the profitability is low because an external attacker cannot directly exploit this for profit.",
