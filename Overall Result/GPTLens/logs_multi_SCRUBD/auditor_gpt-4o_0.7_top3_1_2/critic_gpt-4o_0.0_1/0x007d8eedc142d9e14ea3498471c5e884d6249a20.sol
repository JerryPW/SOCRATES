        "criticism": "The reasoning correctly identifies a discrepancy between the code and the comment, which suggests a potential oversight in the intended fee cap. However, the severity of this issue is moderate because the deployer is the only one who can change the fees, and it is a design decision rather than a vulnerability. The profitability is low for external attackers, but the deployer could exploit users by setting high fees.",
