The _transfer function indeed emits a Transfer event without modifying any balances, which can mislead users and other contracts into believing a transfer has occurred. This could potentially be exploited for fraudulent purposes, such as creating false transaction histories. The severity is moderate because it can cause significant confusion and potential misuse. The profitability is low for an external attacker, as it primarily affects the integrity of the transaction records rather than directly benefiting an attacker.",

When 'streit' is false, the function can bypass balance updates and tax logic, emitting a Transfer event without an actual transfer or tax deduction. This inconsistency can be exploited to avoid tax deductions, which is a significant issue in systems relying on tax mechanisms. The severity is high due to the potential financial impact on the system's tax mechanism.
