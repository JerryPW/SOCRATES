This can indeed lead to incorrect unlocking behavior. However, the exploitability of this vulnerability depends on whether an attacker can influence the 'lockTime' parameter. If 'lockTime' is controlled by the owner, the risk is lower. The severity is moderate because it can lead to premature unlocking or indefinite locking, but the profitability is low unless the attacker can control 'lockTime'.",
