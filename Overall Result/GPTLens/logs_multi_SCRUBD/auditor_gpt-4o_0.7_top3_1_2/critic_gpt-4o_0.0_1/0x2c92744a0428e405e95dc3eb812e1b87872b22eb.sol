This can lead to funds being sent to an unintended or invalid address, resulting in a loss of funds. However, the claim that malicious actors could exploit this by controlling the destination address is incorrect, as the address is hardcoded and cannot be changed by external actors. The severity is moderate due to potential fund loss, but profitability is low as attackers cannot directly benefit.",
