The function allows users to queue up for tickets if the requested amount exceeds the available tickets, which could be manipulated by an attacker to fill the queue with large requests, potentially delaying other users. However, the function does not inherently block other users from participating, as it processes the queue in a first-come, first-served manner. The severity is moderate because it can delay the game, but it does not prevent participation entirely. The profitability is low because the attacker does not gain a direct financial advantage.",
