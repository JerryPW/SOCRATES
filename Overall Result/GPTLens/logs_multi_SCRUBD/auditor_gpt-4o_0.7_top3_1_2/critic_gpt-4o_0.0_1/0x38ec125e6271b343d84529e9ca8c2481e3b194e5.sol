This action is irreversible and prevents any further administrative control, which could be critical for managing contract settings and addressing any future issues. The severity is high due to the potential impact on the contract's functionality and security.

However, the likelihood of exploitation depends on the implementation of the protections contract. If it is a trusted contract with no harmful callbacks, the risk is mitigated.
