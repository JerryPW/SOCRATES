The function does indeed send ETH to the owner without a reentrancy guard, which could be a concern if the contract allows ETH deposits and has other functions that could be re-entered. However, the function uses a direct call to transfer ETH, which is generally safe from reentrancy attacks unless the contract has other vulnerabilities that allow reentrancy. The severity is moderate because it depends on the presence of other vulnerabilities, and the profitability is low unless combined with other issues.",

If any of the recipient addresses are contracts with fallback functions, they could potentially re-enter the contract. However, the function is marked as 'internal' and 'lockTheSwap' is assumed to be a modifier that prevents reentrancy, which reduces the risk.
