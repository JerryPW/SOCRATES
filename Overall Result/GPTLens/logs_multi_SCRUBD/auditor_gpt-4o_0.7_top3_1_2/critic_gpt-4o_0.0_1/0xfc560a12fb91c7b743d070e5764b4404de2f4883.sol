This external call can indeed be exploited if the beneficiary is a contract with a fallback function that re-enters `safeWithdrawal`. However, the function does not update any state variables after the external call, which reduces the risk of reentrancy. The severity is moderate because it depends on the beneficiary's contract implementation. The profitability is moderate as well, as an attacker could potentially drain funds if the conditions are met.",

However, this is a common pattern in contract deployment, where the deployer sets initial parameters.
