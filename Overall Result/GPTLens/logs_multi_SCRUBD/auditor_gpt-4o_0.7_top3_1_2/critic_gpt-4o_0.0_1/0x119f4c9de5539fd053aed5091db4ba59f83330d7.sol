Hardcoding addresses can indeed lead to difficulties in updating or changing them if organizational changes occur. Additionally, if any of these addresses become invalid or compromised, it could result in a loss of funds. However, the severity is moderate as it primarily affects the flexibility and maintainability of the contract rather than posing an immediate security threat. The profitability for an attacker is low since this issue does not directly allow for unauthorized fund access.",
