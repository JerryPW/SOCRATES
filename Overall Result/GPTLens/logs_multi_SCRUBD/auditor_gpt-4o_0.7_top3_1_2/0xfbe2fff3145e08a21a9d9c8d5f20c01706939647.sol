        "vulnerability": "Lack of check on `msg.value`",
        "reason": "The `Collect` function does not check whether any Ether was sent with the transaction. While it doesn't directly affect the logic, it could lead to confusion or unexpected behavior if someone tries to collect with Ether attached to the call. It's best practice to ensure that no Ether is sent by accident.",

        "vulnerability": "Incorrect use of `var` for storage variable",
        "reason": "The `Put` function uses `var` to define `acc`, which is a storage reference to a mapping element. Using `var` can lead to unexpected behavior as it defaults to the smallest type that can store the value, potentially causing errors or inefficiencies. It is safer and more readable to explicitly define the type of such variables.",
