        "reason": "The `transferOwnership` function does not have extra safeguards to prevent accidental transfers to unintended addresses, such as allowing only whitelisted addresses or requiring multiple confirmations. An attacker could potentially exploit social engineering tactics to trick the owner into transferring ownership to an attacker-controlled address.",

        "vulnerability": "Potential time manipulation",
        "reason": "The `unlock` function relies on the `now` keyword, which can potentially be manipulated by miners. An attacker with control over block timestamps could prematurely unlock the contract by manipulating the timestamp, bypassing the intended lock period.",
