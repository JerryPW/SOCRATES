        "reason": "The function `buy` is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks because it transfers Ether to the seller before resetting the token's price. An attacker could exploit this by re-entering the `buy` function before the price is reset, potentially causing incorrect state updates or double spending.",

This can be exploited by a malicious owner to drain the contract's funds without transparency or accountability.",

        "reason": "The `setFee` function is marked as `view`, which means it does not alter the state. However, it attempts to set new fee values, which will not persist due to the `view` modifier. This function effectively does nothing to change the fees, and it can mislead contract users into thinking fees have been updated.",
