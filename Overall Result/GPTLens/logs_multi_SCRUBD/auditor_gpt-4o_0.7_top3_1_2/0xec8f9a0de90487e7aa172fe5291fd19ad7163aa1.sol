        "vulnerability": "Lack of input validation for _dests array",
        "reason": "The multiSend function does not validate the _dests array, which can lead to unintended behavior if the array is empty or contains invalid addresses. An empty array will result in unnecessary computation, while invalid addresses may lead to token loss as the transfer function could fail silently depending on the implementation of the token contract.",

        "vulnerability": "Potential reentrancy in tokensBack function",
        "reason": "Although the tokensBack function uses a direct transfer, if the token contract does not follow best practices, it might call back into the contract. The function does not update the state before the call, which can be exploited in such scenarios if the token supports reentrancy. To prevent this, it is advisable to update the state variables before making any external calls.",

        "vulnerability": "No upper limit on airdrop value",
        "reason": "The changeAirdropValue function allows the owner to set an arbitrary defValue without any upper limit. This can potentially exhaust the contract's token balance very quickly if set to a high value, leading to failed transactions and potential loss of funds if the contract cannot fulfill the multiSend transfers.",
