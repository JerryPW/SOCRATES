        "vulnerability": "Ownership renouncement to zero address",
        "reason": "The renounceOwnership function sets the contract owner to the zero address, effectively making the contract ownerless. This prevents any further administrative control over the contract settings such as setting fees, managing liquidity pairs, and other critical functions. Consequently, any bugs or necessary upgrades cannot be managed, posing a significant risk to the contract's security and functionality.",

        "vulnerability": "Potential reentrancy issue",
        "reason": "The finalizeTransfer function attempts to call an external contract (protections) without proper reentrancy guards. Although the inSwapFlag modifier is used in other functions, it is not applied here. An attacker could exploit this by using a reentrancy attack to call back into the finalizeTransfer function, potentially allowing them to manipulate the state of the contract in ways that could be harmful.",

However, there is no validation to ensure that the new router address is correct, genuine, or compatible with the existing contract logic. If an incorrect or malicious address is set, it could lead to loss of funds or disruption of the token's liquidity operations.",
