        "vulnerability": "Insecure token transfer",
        "reason": "The fallback function calls `tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender, amount / price);` without checking the return value for success. In Solidity versions prior to 0.5.0, the absence of a return value check can result in an insecure token transfer where the function might fail silently, and the tokens would not be transferred correctly to the sender. This might leave contributors without tokens despite the Ether being deducted.",

        "vulnerability": "Logic flaw in fund transfer",
        "reason": "The fallback function sends the entire `amountRaised` to the beneficiary each time it is executed, then resets `amountRaised` to zero. This logic does not correctly account for individual contributions and immediately empties the contract balance, making it impossible to track or refund individual contributions correctly. This can be exploited by an attacker to force the contract into a state where no funds are left for legitimate contributors, potentially leading to loss of funds if a refund mechanism is added.",
