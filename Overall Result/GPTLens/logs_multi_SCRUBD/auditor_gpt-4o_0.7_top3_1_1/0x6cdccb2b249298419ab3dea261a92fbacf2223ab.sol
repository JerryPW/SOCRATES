        "vulnerability": "Unchecked send call",
        "reason": "The use of `send` for transferring ether is risky because it only forwards a fixed amount of gas. If the recipient is a contract with complex logic in its fallback function, the call may fail. The return value of the `send` function, which indicates success or failure, is currently not checked beyond event logging. This could lead to scenarios where funds are unintentionally not transferred, but the logic continues executing as if they were.",

        "vulnerability": "Lack of reentrancy protection",
        "reason": "The payout function uses a loop to process transactions to multiple recipients. Given that the `send` call forwards a small amount of gas, if it were replaced with `call` or if the recipient contract has some form of reentrancy attack vector, an attacker could exploit this to drain funds by reentering the `payout` function.",
