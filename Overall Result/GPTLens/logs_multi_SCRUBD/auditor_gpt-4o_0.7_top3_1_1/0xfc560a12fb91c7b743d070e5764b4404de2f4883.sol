        "reason": "The token allocation calculation `((balanceOf[buyerId] * 500) * 125) / 100` is hard-coded and does not properly account for the actual token supply or distribution logic that might be expected by the participants. Additionally, if the token balance (`totalTokens`) is miscalculated or insufficient, the contract will not properly distribute tokens among all buyers, potentially leading to unfair distribution or depletion of tokens before all participants are rewarded.",

This could allow the attacker to re-enter the `safeWithdrawal` function and manipulate the state or drain additional funds.",
