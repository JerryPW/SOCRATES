This could lead to a loss of tokens intended for airdrop if the 'transfer' function fails for some addresses.",

        "vulnerability": "Use of 'send' instead of 'transfer'",
        "reason": "The 'withdraw' function uses 'send' to transfer the contract's balance to the owner. 'Send' only forwards 2300 gas and does not throw an error if the transfer fails, which may lead to funds being stuck in the contract if the recipient address is a contract with a fallback function that requires more than 2300 gas. Using 'transfer' or 'call.value' with correct gas handling is recommended.",

        "vulnerability": "Reentrancy risk",
        "reason": "Although 'send' mitigates reentrancy to some extent by forwarding limited gas, it's still possible to reenter by other means if the owner is a contract. The function first sends Ether and then returns true without checking if the transfer was successful. An attacker could potentially exploit this by reentering the contract and calling 'withdraw' again before the first call finishes. To prevent reentrancy, consider using a reentrancy guard or the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern.",
