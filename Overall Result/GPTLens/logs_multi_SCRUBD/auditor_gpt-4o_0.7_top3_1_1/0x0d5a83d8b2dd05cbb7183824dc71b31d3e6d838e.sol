        "vulnerability": "Ownership Renouncement",
        "reason": "This function allows the current owner to renounce ownership and set the owner to the zero address, effectively making the contract ownerless. Once the ownership is renounced, no one can call functions with the `onlyOwner` modifier, potentially locking important functionality such as changing fees or enabling/disabling trading.",

        "vulnerability": "Lack of Transfer Fee Handling",
        "reason": "The `transfer` function does not explicitly handle or deduct transaction fees. Instead, it relies on the `_transfer` internal function to manage fees through complex logic. This indirect handling can lead to potential errors or misconfiguration, especially if the `_transfer` logic is altered or if there are edge cases that bypass fee deduction.",

        "vulnerability": "Zero Fee Setting",
        "reason": "This function sets the buy market and liquidity fees to zero without any restrictions or time limits. If the owner repeatedly calls this function and does not reset the fees after the cooldown period, it can lead to significant loss of potential revenue from fees. Additionally, the lack of transparency in the function's effect may mislead token holders.",
