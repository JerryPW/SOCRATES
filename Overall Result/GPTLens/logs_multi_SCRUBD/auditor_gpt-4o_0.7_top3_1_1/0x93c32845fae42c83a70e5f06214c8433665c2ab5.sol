        "vulnerability": "Timestamp Dependence",
        "reason": "The `Put` function uses `now` to determine the `unlockTime`. This is problematic because miners can manipulate the timestamp slightly, which could be exploited in time-sensitive logic and potentially allow an attacker to set a non-ideal unlock time.",
