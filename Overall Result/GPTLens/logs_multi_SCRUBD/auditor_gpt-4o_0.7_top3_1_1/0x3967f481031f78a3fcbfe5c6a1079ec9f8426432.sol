This is dangerous as it bypasses the standard ERC20 function checks and can result in unexpected behavior or failed token transfers. Moreover, there is no validation that the 'from' address has approved the contract to transfer tokens on their behalf, which can lead to failed transactions and potential token loss if not properly managed.",
