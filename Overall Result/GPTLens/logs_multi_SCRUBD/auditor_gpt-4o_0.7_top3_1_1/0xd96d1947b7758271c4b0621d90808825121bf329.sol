Additionally, .send returns false on failure but this is not checked, potentially leading to funds not being properly refunded without any action taken.",

As in the refundBid function, this can fail silently without checking the return value, potentially leaving funds stuck in the contract. This can also be exploited by attackers if the owner address is a contract with a fallback function that consumes more than 2300 gas.",
