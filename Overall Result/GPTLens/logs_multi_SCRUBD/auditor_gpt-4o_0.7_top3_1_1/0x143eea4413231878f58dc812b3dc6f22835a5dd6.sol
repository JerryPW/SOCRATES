        "vulnerability": "Reentrancy",

        "vulnerability": "Inadequate Lock Time Check",
        "reason": "The `Put` function sets the `unlockTime` to the maximum of `_unlockTime` or `now`. This allows a user to potentially lock their funds immediately by passing an `_unlockTime` less than `now`, which could lead to logic errors or unexpected behavior, especially if combined with other vulnerabilities like reentrancy.",

This can be exploited by an attacker to cover up malicious activities or confuse users.",
