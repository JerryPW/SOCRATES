        "reason": "The function allows the contract owner to change both buy and sell fees. While there is a check to ensure the fees are not too high, there is no lower bound set. This means the owner could set the fees to zero, potentially allowing fee-free trades for themselves or their associates, which could be used to manipulate trading or liquidity provision strategies at the expense of other users.",

        "reason": "The renounceOwnership function sets the owner to a 'dead' address. This is a common pattern to truly renounce ownership, but it may cause issues if the owner needs to intervene in the future for any reason. It effectively locks the contract and could potentially trap funds or stop essential functionality if the owner needs to update or fix any contract logic.",

        "vulnerability": "Approval race condition",
        "reason": "The function approves an infinite amount of tokens for the router to spend. This is a potential security risk because if the router or any external contract is compromised, it could drain all the tokens from the contract. Additionally, the approval is done within the function without a specific allowance check, leaving it open to race conditions or unexpected behavior if called concurrently.",
