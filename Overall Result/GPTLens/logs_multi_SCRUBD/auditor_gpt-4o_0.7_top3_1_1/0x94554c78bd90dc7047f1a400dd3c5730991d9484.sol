        "vulnerability": "Race condition/transaction order dependence",
        "reason": "The approve function allows changing the allowance for a spender without considering the current allowance value. This can lead to a race condition where a spender might exploit this by spending the current allowance before the new allowance is set, resulting in unexpected double spending. A safer approach is to use increaseApproval and decreaseApproval functions that mitigate this risk.",

        "vulnerability": "Reentrancy vulnerability",
        "reason": "This function contains a reentrancy vulnerability because it updates the state variable 'withdrawed' after the external call to 'OppToken.transfer'. This allows an attacker to re-enter the function and execute it multiple times before the state is updated, leading to multiple withdrawals. The state change should occur before calling external functions to prevent reentrancy attacks.",
