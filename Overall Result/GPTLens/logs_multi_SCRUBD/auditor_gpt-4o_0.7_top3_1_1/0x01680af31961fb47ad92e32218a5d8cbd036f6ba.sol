        "vulnerability": "Ownerless Contract",
        "reason": "The `renounceOwnership` function allows the current owner to set the owner address to the zero address, which effectively makes the contract ownerless. Once the owner is set to the zero address, no further privileged actions that require owner permission can be performed. This can be potentially risky if the owner needs to perform future administrative tasks or recover from errors.",

        "vulnerability": "Single Address Control",
        "reason": "The `manualswap` function can only be called by a specific address, `_feeAddrWallet1`. This centralized control can be risky if the private key of `_feeAddrWallet1` is compromised or lost, as it grants the ability to swap all tokens held by the contract, potentially draining it of its token balance.",

        "vulnerability": "Single Address Control",
        "reason": "Similar to `manualswap`, the `manualsend` function is controlled by a single address, `_feeAddrWallet1`. This function allows the entire ETH balance of the contract to be sent to the fee addresses. If the private key of `_feeAddrWallet1` is compromised, an attacker could misuse this function to transfer all ETH from the contract to the fee addresses or potentially manipulate the process for malicious purposes.",
