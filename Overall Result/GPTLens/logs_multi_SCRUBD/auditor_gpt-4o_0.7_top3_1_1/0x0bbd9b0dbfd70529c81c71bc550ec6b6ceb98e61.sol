        "vulnerability": "ownership_renouncement",
        "reason": "The `renounceOwnership` function allows the owner to set the contract's owner to the zero address, effectively making the contract ownerless. While this might be intended for decentralization, it poses a risk as it prevents any further administrative control or upgrades to the contract, which could be problematic if future vulnerabilities or needed changes arise.",

        "vulnerability": "irreversible_pause_disabling",
        "reason": "The `disablePauseAbility` function allows the owner to permanently disable the ability to pause trading. Once this function is called, the `disableToken` function becomes unusable, and trading cannot be paused in the future. This could be exploited by an attacker or become problematic if the contract needs to be paused due to unforeseen circumstances or vulnerabilities.",

        "reason": "The `addBot` function allows the owner to arbitrarily add any address to the `bots` mapping. Once an address is flagged as a bot, it is restricted from trading. This centralizes significant control in the hands of the owner, enabling potential abuse where legitimate users might be unfairly restricted from trading.",
