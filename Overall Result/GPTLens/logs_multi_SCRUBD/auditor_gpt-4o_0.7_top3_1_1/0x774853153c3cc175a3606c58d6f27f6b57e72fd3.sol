        "vulnerability": "Use of deprecated and unsafe `call` method",
        "reason": "The `call` method is used to send Ether, which does not propagate exceptions, making it difficult to handle errors properly. Using `transfer` or `send` is safer as they throw exceptions on failure. This can cause unintended behavior if the call fails silently.",
