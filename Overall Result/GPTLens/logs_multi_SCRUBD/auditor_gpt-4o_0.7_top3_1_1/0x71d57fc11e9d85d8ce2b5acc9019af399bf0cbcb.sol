        "reason": "The function sets 'end_time' to the value of 'lockTime', which is intended to be the duration for which tokens should be locked. However, it directly assigns 'lockTime' to 'end_time' instead of calculating it as 'start_time + lockTime'. This means that if 'lockTime' is set to a timestamp in the past or near the current time, the lock period may be invalid or immediately expired, allowing the lock period to be bypassed.",

        "vulnerability": "Lack of transfer success verification",
        "reason": "The 'release' function calls 'token_reward.transfer' to transfer tokens to the beneficiary but does not check the return value of this function call. If the transfer fails (for example, due to insufficient gas or a failure in the token contract), 'isReleased' will still be set to true, and the tokens will remain locked in the contract, potentially permanently.",

        "vulnerability": "Lack of event emission for lock action",
        "reason": "The 'lock' function does not emit any event when tokens are locked. This omission makes it difficult to track locking actions on the blockchain, reducing transparency and auditability. An attacker could exploit this lack of transparency to perform unauthorized or suspicious locking actions without being easily detected.",
