        "vulnerability": "Unsafe Ether withdrawal",
        "reason": "The use of 'send' for transferring Ether can result in funds being stuck due to the 2300 gas limit imposed by 'send'. If the recipient is a contract, it might not be able to execute complex logic in its fallback function, leading to a failed transaction and potential loss of Ether. A more reliable approach is using 'call' with a gas stipend.",
