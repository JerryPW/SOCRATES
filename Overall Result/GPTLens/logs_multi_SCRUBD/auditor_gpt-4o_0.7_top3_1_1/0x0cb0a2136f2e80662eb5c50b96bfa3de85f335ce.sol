This could lead to severe inflation, devaluing the token and causing economic harm to token holders.",

        "reason": "The _payTreasury function involves external calls to the treasury contract and the staking contract. If these contracts are untrusted or can call back into the IGLOO contract, they could potentially exploit a reentrancy vulnerability. Although the function uses a swapping modifier to prevent reentrancy, this modifier only sets a boolean flag, which may not be sufficient against sophisticated reentrancy attacks if other functions in the contract can be influenced.",

        "reason": "The transferETH function allows the contract owner to withdraw all ETH held by the contract using a low-level call. If the owner address is compromised, all ETH can be irreversibly drained from the contract. Additionally, using call without handling the return status may result in failures if the receiving address has specific logic in its fallback function or if it runs out of gas.",
