        "vulnerability": "Irreversible Ownership Renouncement",
        "reason": "The renounceOwnership function allows the current owner to renounce ownership and set the owner address to zero. This action is irreversible and will make several functions that require the onlyOwner modifier inaccessible, such as setCooldownEnabled, liftMaxTx, and openTrading. As a result, the contract may become non-functional and unable to adapt to future changes or respond to emergencies.",

        "reason": "The manualswap function is restricted to only be called by the address _feeAddrWallet1. This creates a centralization risk because if this address is compromised, the attacker can call the function to swap all tokens in the contract for ETH. This could lead to a significant loss of funds for token holders.",

        "reason": "Similar to manualswap, the manualsend function can only be called by the address _feeAddrWallet1, which poses a centralization risk.
