        "vulnerability": "Missing Access Control",
        "reason": "The `withdraw` function is protected by a simple require statement that checks if the caller is equivalent to the hardcoded address `safe`. However, if the private key of the address `safe` is compromised, an attacker can withdraw all funds from the contract. Additionally, the use of `msg.sender.transfer` is discouraged because it could lead to reentrancy vulnerabilities if not properly secured. Instead, using a withdrawal pattern with checks-effects-interactions or using `send` or `call` with proper checks would be safer.",

        "vulnerability": "Incorrect Randomness",
        "reason": "The random number generation using `keccak256(abi.encodePacked(voidOwner, msg.value))` is predictable and can be exploited by miners or adversaries to manipulate the randomness. This could allow attackers to gain an advantage in the collectible creation process by predicting or manipulating the outcome. A more secure source of randomness should be used, such as Chainlink VRF or another oracle-based solution.",

        "vulnerability": "Data Inconsistency",
        "reason": "After calling `_burn(tokenId)`, the token's existence is completely removed from the contract. However, the function proceeds to manipulate data structures related to the token (e.g., `tokenIdToRand`, `tokenIdToVoid`, `tokenIdToOwner`) which are intended to be associated with existing tokens. This could lead to inconsistent states or unintended side effects. Once a token is burned, any associated data mappings should be cleaned up properly or not manipulated post-burn.",
