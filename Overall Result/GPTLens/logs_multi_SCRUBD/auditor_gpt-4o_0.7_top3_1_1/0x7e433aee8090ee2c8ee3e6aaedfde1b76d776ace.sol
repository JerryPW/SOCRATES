        "reason": "The 'lock' function allows the owner to set any arbitrary 'end_time' by passing a 'lockTime' value, which is expected to be a future timestamp. However, there is no validation to ensure that 'lockTime' is actually a future time compared to 'now'. This means the owner can set 'end_time' to a past time, immediately satisfying the 'lockOver' condition and making the lock ineffective.",

        "reason": "The 'release' function is restricted to the owner of the contract, meaning that only the owner can release the tokens after the lock period is over. If the owner becomes malicious or loses the private key, the beneficiary will never be able to access the locked tokens even after the lock period has ended.",
