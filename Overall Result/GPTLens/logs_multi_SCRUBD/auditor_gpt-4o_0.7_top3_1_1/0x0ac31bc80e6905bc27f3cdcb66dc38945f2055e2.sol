        "vulnerability": "Unsafe Ether transfer",
        "reason": "The withdraw function uses the transfer method to send Ether, which can be unsafe due to the 2300 gas stipend limitation. If the recipient is a smart contract with complex logic in its fallback or receive function, the transfer may fail. Additionally, transfer does not handle reentrancy vulnerabilities, which could allow an attacker to exploit this function if the reentrancy guard is not implemented.",

An attacker could call this function in a reentrant manner, potentially manipulating the total supply and causing inconsistencies in the contract's state. Reentrancy guards like OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard should be used to prevent such attacks.",
