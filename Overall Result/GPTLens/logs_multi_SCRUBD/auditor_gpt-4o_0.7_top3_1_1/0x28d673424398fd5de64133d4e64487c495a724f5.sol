        "reason": "The calculation 'address(this).balance - msg.value' is intended to refund the sender with the entire contract balance minus the sent value.

        "vulnerability": "Use of 'send' instead of 'transfer'",
        "reason": "The 'send' method is used to transfer ether, which only forwards 2300 gas and does not throw an error on failure. This can lead to silent failures where transactions appear to succeed but do not actually transfer ether, leaving the contract in an inconsistent state if not properly handled.",
