        "vulnerability": "Ownership cannot be reclaimed",
        "reason": "The `renounceOwnership` function sets the owner to the zero address, effectively making the contract without an owner. This means that no one can call `onlyOwner` functions in the future, potentially locking important functionality that should only be accessible to the owner. This is particularly dangerous if any critical functions, such as functions to withdraw funds or modify important parameters, are protected by the `onlyOwner` modifier.",

        "vulnerability": "Potential reentrancy risk with liquidity addition",
        "reason": "Using `addLiquidityETH{value: address(this).balance}` without proper reentrancy protection can be risky. If the contract receives Ether through a fallback function that triggers `startTrading`, and if `addLiquidityETH` makes an external call before setting important state variables, it could open up potential reentrancy vulnerabilities. Although the contract uses a `lockTheSwap` modifier elsewhere, `startTrading` does not employ such protection. This does not seem immediately exploitable but is a good practice to ensure reentrancy protections are in place where external calls are involved.",
