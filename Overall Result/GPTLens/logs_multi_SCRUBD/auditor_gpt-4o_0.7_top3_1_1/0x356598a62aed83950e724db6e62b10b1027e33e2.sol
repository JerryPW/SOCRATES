        "reason": "The withdraw function allows the contract owner to withdraw the entire balance of the contract using a low-level call. If the owner is a contract, it could potentially reenter the contract during the withdrawal process. This is a classic reentrancy vulnerability, which could be exploited if the receiving account is a contract that implements a fallback function to reenter the withdraw function before the balance is updated.",

        "reason": "The function makes external calls to fee1Address and fee2Address using the call method, but does not check the success value of these calls.

This could lead to a situation where the contract state is inconsistent with the intended state, as fees might not be properly distributed.",

        "vulnerability": "Lack of transfer return value check",
        "reason": "The _releaseTokens function calls the transfer method on the IERC20 interface without checking the return value.

If the transfer fails, and the return value is not checked, the function might assume the transfer succeeded, potentially leading to inconsistencies in the token balance tracking.",
