        "vulnerability": "race_condition_on_approve",
        "reason": "The approve function contains a potential race condition vulnerability known as the 'multiple withdrawal attack' or 'approve/transferFrom race condition'. This occurs because the function does not reduce the allowance to zero before setting it to a new value. An attacker could exploit this by transferring tokens and then quickly setting a new allowance before the owner realizes what has happened, potentially allowing double-spending of tokens.",

        "vulnerability": "lack_of_transfer_restrictions",
        "reason": "The internalTransfer function does not check for conditions like preventing transfers to the zero address. This could lead to scenarios where tokens are sent to the zero address, effectively burning them and causing a loss of tokens for the user.",
