        "vulnerability": "Improper Authorization",
        "reason": "The withdraw function allows only the contract owner to withdraw funds of any user. The use of msg.sender to access deposits allows the owner to withdraw funds from any depositor's balance, rather than only their own. This can lead to unauthorized withdrawals and loss of funds for depositors, as the owner has complete control over all balances.",

        "vulnerability": "Denial of Service",
        "reason": "The kill function requires the contract balance to be zero before allowing self-destruction. If there are residual funds due to rounding errors or miscalculations, the owner will never be able to destroy the contract, leading to a potential denial of service where the contract cannot be properly cleaned up or terminated.",

        "vulnerability": "Lack of Reentrancy Protection",
        "reason": "The deposit function does not use a reentrancy guard. Although it does not directly transfer funds out, it could be part of a larger system where reentrancy attacks might be possible. If combined with other vulnerabilities or functions, an attacker could exploit this to manipulate their deposit balances during the execution of another call.",
