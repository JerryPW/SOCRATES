        "vulnerability": "Potential Reentrancy Attack",
        "reason": "The `withdrawEther` function sends Ether to the `to` address using `send`. If the recipient is a contract, it can perform further operations before the balance is updated, potentially causing a reentrancy attack where repeated calls drain the contract's balance. Although `send` only sends 2300 gas, limiting reentrancy scope, it's still a potential concern if the recipient is a contract.",

        "vulnerability": "Improper Ownership Transfer Check",
        "reason": "The function does not check if the new BZx contract address is already set to the current contract address, allowing an attacker to set the `bZxContractAddress` to a contract they control if the check is bypassed somehow, gaining unauthorized access to functions protected by `onlyBZx` modifier.",
