        "reason": "The function `transferOwnership` allows the current owner to transfer control of the contract to any address, including zero address or the contract address itself. This can lead to loss of control over the contract. Proper validation should ensure that the new owner is a valid address.",

        "reason": "The function `setDistributorSettings` allows an authorized user to set the gas limit for the distributor process. The specified limit (17500000) is very high and may cause issues with gas consumption. Although there is a check, it is too high to be practical. Setting an excessively high gas limit can lead to denial of service by consuming all available gas for a single transaction.",

        "vulnerability": "Reentrancy vulnerability",
        "reason": "The function `shouldAutoBuyback` checks conditions for auto-buyback but does not prevent reentrancy effectively. If an attacker can manipulate the balance or the block number during the execution of auto buyback operations, they might repeatedly trigger buybacks, potentially draining contract funds. Using a reentrancy guard would help mitigate this risk.",
