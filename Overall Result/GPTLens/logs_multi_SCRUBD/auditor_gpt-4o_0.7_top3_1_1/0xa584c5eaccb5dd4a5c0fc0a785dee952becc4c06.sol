        "reason": "The multiplication 'tobesent*10e7' can cause an integer overflow if 'tobesent' is a large value. This can lead to incorrect token distribution, allowing an attacker to receive more tokens than they paid for.",

        "vulnerability": "Unsafe send operation",
        "reason": "The use of 'send' is insecure because it only forwards 2300 gas, potentially causing the transaction to fail. Additionally, it does not check for the success of the transaction, meaning funds could be lost if the send fails. This should be replaced with 'transfer' or 'call' with proper checks.",

        "vulnerability": "Reentrancy vulnerability",
        "reason": "Although the function is restricted to the contract owner, if compromised, the 'send' operation could potentially be exploited through a fallback function in a malicious contract, allowing reentrancy attacks to drain funds before the balance is updated.",
