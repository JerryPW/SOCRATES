        "vulnerability": "Potential loss of control",
        "reason": "The renounceOwnership function allows the current owner to relinquish ownership, setting the owner address to zero. This action is irreversible and results in the contract having no owner, which means that no further administrative actions can be taken, such as adjusting fees or recovering from errors. While this may be intentional to decentralize control, it permanently disables any administrative capabilities, which could be problematic if contract changes are needed later.",
