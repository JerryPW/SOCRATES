        "vulnerability": "Irreversible renounce ownership",
        "reason": "The renounceOwnership function allows the contract owner to set the owner address to the zero address, effectively making the contract ownerless. This action is irreversible, and no further administrative functions that require the onlyOwner modifier can be executed. While this might be intended in some contexts, if done unintentionally, it can lead to a situation where essential functions like setting trading parameters or retrieving funds are no longer possible.",

        "reason": "The manualswap function allows the account set as _feeAddrWallet1 to swap all contract-held tokens for ETH. If _feeAddrWallet1 is compromised or if access management is not properly handled, this function could be exploited. Additionally, it is susceptible to frontrunning attacks where an attacker can manipulate the token balance or ETH price before the swap is executed.",

        "reason": "The manualsend function allows the account set as _feeAddrWallet1 to send the entire balance of ETH held by the contract to another address. If the _feeAddrWallet1 is compromised, this could lead to the unauthorized withdrawal of all ETH from the contract. This function lacks proper access control mechanisms, making it a target for misuse if the designated account is not secure.",
