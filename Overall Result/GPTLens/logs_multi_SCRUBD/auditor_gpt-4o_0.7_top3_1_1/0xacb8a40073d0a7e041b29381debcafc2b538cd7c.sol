        "vulnerability": "Incorrect usage of msg.value",
        "reason": "The function 'ToLend' allows users to call it with any value, including zero, which can result in an increase in the user's 'Invested' amount without actually transferring any funds. This could be exploited by users to manipulate the 'Certificates' mapping inaccurately, allowing them to potentially claim more than they have invested.",

        "vulnerability": "Use of send() for Ether transfer",
        "reason": "Using 'send' for Ether transfer is not recommended due to its limited gas stipend, which could cause the transaction to fail if the receiving address's fallback function requires more than 2300 gas. This could lead to a situation where refunds are not processed correctly, potentially trapping funds in the contract.",

        "vulnerability": "Use of suicide (selfdestruct)",
        "reason": "The 'Close' function allows the contract owner to call 'suicide', which will destroy the contract and send all remaining funds to the owner's address. This can be dangerous and allow for rug pulls if the owner decides to close the contract abruptly, especially if proper checks and balances are not in place to protect investors.",
