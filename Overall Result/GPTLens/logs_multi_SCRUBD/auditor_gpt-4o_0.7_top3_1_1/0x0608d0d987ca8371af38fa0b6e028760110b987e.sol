The send function only forwards 2300 gas, which prevents reentrancy through fallback functions, but it does not prevent other forms of reentrancy attacks that can be performed if the external call is to a contract with a fallback that calls back into the contract. This could lead to unexpected behavior, especially if the contract state is modified after the send.",
