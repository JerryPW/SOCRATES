        "reason": "The 'manualSend' function allows '_feeAddrWallet1' to send the entire ETH balance to predefined wallets. This centralization of control can be exploited if the '_feeAddrWallet1' account is compromised, allowing an attacker to redirect substantial funds without any checks or balances, leading to a loss of funds.",
