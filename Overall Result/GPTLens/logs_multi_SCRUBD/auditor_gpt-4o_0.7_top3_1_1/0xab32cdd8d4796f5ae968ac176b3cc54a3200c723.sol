        "vulnerability": "Unsafe use of send",
        "reason": "The withdraw function uses the send method to transfer Ether to the owner. The send method forwards a fixed amount of 2300 gas, which might not be sufficient for the receiving contract to execute further operations, potentially leading to a failure. Additionally, send does not revert on failure and returns false instead, making it harder to handle errors properly. This can lead to fund loss if the owner does not check the return value of send.",

        "reason": "The setToken function allows the owner to change the token contract address to any arbitrary address without any validation. This can lead to a situation where the owner sets a malicious or incorrect token contract, which can result in loss or misallocation of tokens when users interact with the ICO contract, as token transfers would be directed to an unintended contract.",

        "vulnerability": "Lack of validation on token transfer",
        "reason": "The claimUnsold function transfers all remaining tokens in the contract to the owner once the ICO duration is over. However, there is no validation to ensure that the token transfer was successful. If the token contract does not implement the transfer function correctly or has a different implementation, the transfer may fail silently, leading to potential discrepancies and loss of unsold tokens.",
