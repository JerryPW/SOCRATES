        "vulnerability": "Unsafe Ether transfer using 'send'",
        "reason": "The use of 'send' for transferring Ether is unsafe because it only forwards 2300 gas, which might not be enough for the receiving contract to execute its fallback function. This can lead to a failed transfer and loss of funds. Additionally, 'send' does not revert on failure, which can cause inconsistency in the contract's state. It's safer to use 'transfer' or 'call' with proper error handling.",

        "vulnerability": "Lack of input validation leading to potential denial of service",
        "reason": "The function does not validate the length of '_tokenIds' array, which could lead to excessive gas consumption and cause the transaction to fail if a very large array is passed. This could be exploited to cause a denial of service by repeatedly calling this function with a large array, consuming the block gas limit and preventing other operations.",

        "vulnerability": "Lack of access control for token sweeping",
        "reason": "The 'sweepToken' function allows any user to trigger a transfer of all ERC20 tokens from the contract to the owner without any access restriction. This could potentially lead to unauthorized users draining tokens from the contract to the owner's address, depending on the contract's usage context and assumptions.",
