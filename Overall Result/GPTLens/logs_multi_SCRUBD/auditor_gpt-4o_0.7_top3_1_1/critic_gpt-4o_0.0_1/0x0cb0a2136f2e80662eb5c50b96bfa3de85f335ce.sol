This could lead to an arbitrary increase in the token supply, devaluing existing tokens. However, this isn't inherently a vulnerability, but rather a design decision that might be questionable. The severity is moderate because it is based on the owner's intention. The profitability is low because an external attacker cannot profit from it unless they gain control of the icebox address.",

If these contracts are untrusted or can call back into the IGLOO contract, they could potentially exploit a reentrancy vulnerability.
