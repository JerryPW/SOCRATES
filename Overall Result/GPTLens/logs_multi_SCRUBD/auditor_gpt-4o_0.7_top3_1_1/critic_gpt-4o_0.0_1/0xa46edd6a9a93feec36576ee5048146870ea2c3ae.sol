While the use of the low-level call function can indeed lead to reentrancy attacks, it is not the lack of checking the return value that causes this, but rather the lack of a reentrancy guard.

        "reason": "The use of the low-level call function without checking the result can also lead to reentrancy attacks if the target contract is malicious.
