If the withdrawer's credentials are compromised, an attacker could redirect funds. However, this is more of a design decision rather than a vulnerability, as the function is intended to allow the withdrawer to update the address. The severity is moderate due to the potential impact if credentials are compromised, but the profitability is low as it requires prior access to the withdrawer's credentials.",
