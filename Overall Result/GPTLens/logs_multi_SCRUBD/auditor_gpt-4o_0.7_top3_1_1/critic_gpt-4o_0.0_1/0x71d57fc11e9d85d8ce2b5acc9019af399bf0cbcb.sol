However, it directly assigns 'lockTime' to 'end_time' instead of calculating it as 'start_time + lockTime'. This means that if 'lockTime' is set to a timestamp in the past or near the current time, the lock period may be invalid or immediately expired, allowing the lock period to be bypassed. The severity is high because it can lead to immediate expiration of the lock period. The profitability is moderate because an external attacker cannot directly profit from it, but it can lead to potential loss for the owner.",
