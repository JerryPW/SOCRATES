However, spoofing msg.sender is not feasible in Ethereum, so the main risk lies in the maintenance of the tokenMaster list. The severity is moderate due to potential unauthorized transfers, and profitability is moderate as well, as an attacker could potentially transfer tokens to themselves.",

However, the use of send() with limited gas mitigates the risk of reentrancy attacks, as it does not provide enough gas for a reentrant call to modify state.
