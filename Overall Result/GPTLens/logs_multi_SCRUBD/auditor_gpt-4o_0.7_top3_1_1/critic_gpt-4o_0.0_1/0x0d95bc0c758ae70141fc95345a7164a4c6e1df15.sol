These restrictions could potentially be exploited by attackers who front-run transactions to ensure they are not subject to these limits, especially if the limits are lifted at a later time. Additionally, the initial restriction of trading only being allowed after a certain number of blocks (deadBlocks) opens up the potential for manipulative practices during the early stages of trading.",
