However, the use of `send` mitigates this risk to some extent by forwarding only 2300 gas, which is typically insufficient for reentrant calls. The vulnerability is more theoretical unless future changes introduce more complex interactions. The severity is moderate due to the potential impact if exploited, but the profitability is low given the current implementation.",
