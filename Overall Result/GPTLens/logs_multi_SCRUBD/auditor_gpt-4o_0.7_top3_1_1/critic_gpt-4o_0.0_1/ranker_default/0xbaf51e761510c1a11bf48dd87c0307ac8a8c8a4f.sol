        "reason": "The CashOut function uses `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()` to transfer Ether to the caller, which is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. An attacker could exploit this by recursively calling the CashOut function before the balance is updated, allowing them to drain funds from the contract.",
