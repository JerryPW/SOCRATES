The function 'requestPayout' is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks as it directly transfers Ether to 'msg.sender' without using the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern. The severity is high as it could potentially drain all funds from the contract. The profitability is also high as an attacker could repeatedly call the function to drain funds.",
