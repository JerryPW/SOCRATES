        "criticism": "The reasoning is correct that the swapBack function could potentially allow reentrancy attacks. However, the lockTheSwap modifier is used to prevent reentrancy within the same function, which mitigates the risk. The severity is moderate because if an external call leads to a fallback function that calls back into the contract, it might lead to unexpected behavior. The profitability is low because an external attacker cannot directly profit from it.",

Although the lockTheSwap modifier is used to prevent reentrancy within the same function, if any of the external calls (like transfer) to marketingWallet or devWallet lead to a fallback function that calls back into the contract, it might lead to unexpected behavior. It is generally safer to perform all state changes before making external calls.",
