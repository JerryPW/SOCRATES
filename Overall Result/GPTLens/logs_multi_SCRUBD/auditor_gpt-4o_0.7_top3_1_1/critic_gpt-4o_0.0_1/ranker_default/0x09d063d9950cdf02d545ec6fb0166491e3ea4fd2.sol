If these external calls fail (e.g., due to slippage or insufficient liquidity), the function may not execute as expected, potentially resulting in locked funds within the contract. Additionally, failure in the `bensRevival.deposit` call is silently caught, which means that any issues in this process will not be surfaced, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.",
