However, the risk of reentrancy attack is low as the function is only callable by the owner. The severity is low because it requires the owner to act maliciously or negligently. The profitability is also low because an external attacker cannot directly profit from this vulnerability.",

        "reason": "Using `addLiquidityETH{value: address(this).balance}` without proper reentrancy protection can be risky. If the contract receives Ether through a fallback function that triggers `startTrading`, and if `addLiquidityETH` makes an external call before setting important state variables, it could open up potential reentrancy vulnerabilities. Although the contract uses a `lockTheSwap` modifier elsewhere, `startTrading` does not employ such protection. This does not seem immediately exploitable but is a good practice to ensure reentrancy protections are in place where external calls are involved.",
