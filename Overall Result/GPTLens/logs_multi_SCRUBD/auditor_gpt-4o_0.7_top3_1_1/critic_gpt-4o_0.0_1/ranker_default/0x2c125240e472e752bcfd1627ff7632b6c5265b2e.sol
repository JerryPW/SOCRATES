        "reason": "The buy function performs an external call to transfer funds to the token owner before resetting the price of the token. This pattern can lead to a reentrancy attack where the tokenOwner's fallback function or other called function could re-enter the contract and potentially manipulate the contract's state or call the function again before the state is updated. To mitigate this, the contract should update the state before making external calls.",
