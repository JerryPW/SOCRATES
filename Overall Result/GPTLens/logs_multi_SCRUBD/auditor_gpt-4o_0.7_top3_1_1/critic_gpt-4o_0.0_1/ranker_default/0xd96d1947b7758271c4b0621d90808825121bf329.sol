The refundBid function sends Ether to the previous highest bidder, and if the recipient is a contract, it can re-enter the placeBid function before the highestBid is updated. This can allow a malicious contract to manipulate the auction process. The severity is high because reentrancy can lead to significant financial loss, and the profitability is also high as an attacker can exploit this to win auctions unfairly.",
