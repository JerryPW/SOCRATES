Instead, it returns a fixed value, which can be misleading and exploited by users to claim they have tokens they do not possess. The severity is high because it undermines the integrity of the token balance system. The profitability is moderate, as users can falsely claim token ownership.",

This can mislead users and systems relying on the event logs to track token transfers. The severity is moderate because it affects the transparency and reliability of token transfers.

However, this is not inherently a vulnerability unless the contract is misleading users into thinking they are purchasing tokens or receiving some service.
