This may lead to failed transactions if the recipient address has a fallback function that consumes more than 2300 gas.

While it's true that strings in Solidity are less efficient and could potentially lead to a denial of service attack, the function does not seem to be vulnerable to such an attack as it does not loop over the string characters.
