The function 'calculateInterest' can result in integer overflow when calculating interest, which can be exploited by providing a large 'interestRate'.

If an overflow occurs, it could result in incorrect interest calculations and potentially allow an attacker to drain funds from the contract by receiving inflated interest payouts.
