        "reason": "The function allows the contract owner to change both buy and sell fees. While there is a check to ensure the fees are not too high, there is no lower bound set. This means the owner could set the fees to zero, potentially allowing fee-free trades for themselves or their associates, which could be used to manipulate trading or liquidity provision strategies at the expense of other users.",
