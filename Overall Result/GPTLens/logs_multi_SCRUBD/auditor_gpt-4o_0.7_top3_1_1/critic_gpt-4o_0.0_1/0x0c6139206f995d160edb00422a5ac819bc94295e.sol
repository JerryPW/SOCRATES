This is indeed dangerous as it permanently disables any function that requires owner privileges. If this function is called accidentally or maliciously, it can lead to a loss of contract control and funds, rendering the contract unusable for further updates or fund management. The severity is high because it can lead to a complete loss of control over the contract. The profitability is low because an external attacker cannot profit from it.",

This transfer occurs before the state update, which could be exploited using reentrancy. An attacker could create a contract that calls depositOutput and then executes further actions before the deposits mapping is updated, potentially allowing them to manipulate deposits or withdraw more ETH than they are entitled to by recursively calling depositOutput before the state changes.
