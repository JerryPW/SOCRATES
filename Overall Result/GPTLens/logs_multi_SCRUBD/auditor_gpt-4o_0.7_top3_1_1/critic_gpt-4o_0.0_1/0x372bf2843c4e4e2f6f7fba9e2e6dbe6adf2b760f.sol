However, as the function is private and called internally, the risk of this happening is significantly reduced. The risk would be higher if the function was public and could be called externally. Therefore, the correctness is moderate, the severity is low, and the profitability is also low as an external attacker cannot profit from this vulnerability.",

This can potentially lead to a race condition if the allowance is being manipulated between approval and transfer, particularly if the contract is interacted with while tokens are being swapped. While this issue is mitigated in this specific setup since 'swapTokensForEth' is private and called internally, the pattern can lead to issues if externalized or if the logic changes.",
