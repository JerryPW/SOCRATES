In Solidity version 0.4.18, constructors should not use the 'function' keyword, and the constructor name should match the contract name. However, the provided code does not show any such issue. The severity is low because this is more of a syntactical issue that would prevent deployment rather than a security vulnerability. The profitability is non-existent as this does not lead to any exploitable condition.",
