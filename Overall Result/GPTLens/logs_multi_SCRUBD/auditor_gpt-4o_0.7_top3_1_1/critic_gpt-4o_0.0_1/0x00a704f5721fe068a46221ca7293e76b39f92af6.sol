        "criticism": "The reasoning is correct. The renounceOwnership function allows the owner to irrevocably renounce ownership, which could render the contract non-functional if certain owner-only functions are required for operation. The severity is high because it could potentially render the contract non-functional. The profitability is low because an external attacker cannot profit from this vulnerability.",
        "correctness": 9,
        "severity": 8,
        "profitability": 0,
        "reason": "The renounceOwnership function allows the current owner to renounce ownership and set the owner address to zero. This action is irreversible and will make several functions that require the onlyOwner modifier inaccessible, such as setCooldownEnabled, liftMaxTx, and openTrading. As a result, the contract may become non-functional and unable to adapt to future changes or respond to emergencies.",

        "reason": "The manualswap function is restricted to only be called by the address _feeAddrWallet1.
