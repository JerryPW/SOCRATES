This can lead to a situation where any function requiring the onlyOwner modifier becomes unusable, potentially locking critical contract functionality. The severity is high because it can permanently disable important functions. The profitability is low because an external attacker cannot directly profit from this action.",

However, the vulnerability is not about unrestricted access but rather about centralized control. If the _teamAddress is compromised, it could lead to misuse of funds.
