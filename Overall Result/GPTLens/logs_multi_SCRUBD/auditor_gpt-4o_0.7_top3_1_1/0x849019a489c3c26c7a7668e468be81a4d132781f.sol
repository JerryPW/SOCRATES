        "reason": "The SetTrustee function allows the transfer of ownership to a new trustee but lacks proper access control. It only checks if the caller is the current Owner_O2 or the Creator. If an attacker gains control of Owner_O2, they can change the trustee without any further authentication, potentially taking control of the contract.",

        "reason": "The RefundDeposit function uses the send method to transfer ether, which forwards only 2300 gas, but still, it is susceptible to reentrancy attacks if the recipient is a contract.
