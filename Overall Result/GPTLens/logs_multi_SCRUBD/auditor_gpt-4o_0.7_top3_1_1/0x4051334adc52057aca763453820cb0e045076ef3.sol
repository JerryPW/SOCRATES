        "vulnerability": "Use of low-level call",
        "reason": "The use of 'caddress.call' is unsafe because it does not check if the function call was successful. If the call fails, the transaction will not revert, and control will continue. An attacker could exploit this to make the contract behave incorrectly or consume more gas than necessary without executing the intended function.",

        "vulnerability": "Lack of event logging",
        "reason": "The function does not emit any events after performing transfers, which makes it difficult to track or audit transfers.
