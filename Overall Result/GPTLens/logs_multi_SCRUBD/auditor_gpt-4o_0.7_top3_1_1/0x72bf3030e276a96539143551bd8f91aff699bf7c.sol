        "vulnerability": "Lack of input validation",
        "reason": "The transferOwnership function allows the current owner to transfer ownership to any address, including the zero address (0x0), which would lock the contract since no one controls the zero address. This could potentially lead to the contract becoming unusable if ownership is transferred to an inappropriate address.",

        "vulnerability": "Reentrancy vulnerability",
        "reason": "The finalizeRound function calls external functions distributeWinnings, claimOwnerFee, and withdraw on the currentRound contract, which are potentially untrusted contracts, before any state changes are made. This could allow an attacker to exploit reentrancy by recursively calling functions within the contract, potentially disrupting the expected flow and causing unexpected behaviors or financial loss.",

        "vulnerability": "Lack of input validation",
        "reason": "Similar to transferOwnership, the setCurator function does not validate the newCurator address. As a result, the curator could be set to an invalid or unintended address, such as the zero address, which can disrupt the functionality of the contract since the curator has privileged roles in managing the game rounds.",
