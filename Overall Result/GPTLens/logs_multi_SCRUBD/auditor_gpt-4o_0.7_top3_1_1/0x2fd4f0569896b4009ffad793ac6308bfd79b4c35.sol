        "reason": "The removeLimits function allows the owner to remove transaction and wallet size limits without any restrictions once called.

        "reason": "The _transfer function determines a taxAmount based on whether the transaction is a swap and if trading is open. However, if the from and to addresses are both excluded from fees, no tax is applied. This allows the contract owner, who can set exclusions, to potentially create tax-free transactions, leading to an unfair advantage and potential abuse.",

        "reason": "The withdrawERC20 function allows the owner to withdraw any ERC20 tokens from the contract's balance, not just the native token. This can be problematic if the contract inadvertently receives tokens it should not have access to (e.g., through an airdrop or mistaken transfer), as the owner can remove these tokens and potentially use them maliciously or against the token holder's intentions.",
