        "vulnerability": "Ownerless Contract",
        "reason": "The `renounceOwnership` function allows the owner to set the `_owner` to the zero address, making the contract ownerless. This is a common practice to decentralize control, but it also means that any functionality restricted to the owner will no longer be accessible, potentially locking essential functions and leaving the contract in a non-upgradable state.",

        "vulnerability": "Centralized Control Over Bots",
        "reason": "The `setBots` function allows the contract owner to arbitrarily add addresses to the `bots` mapping, potentially blocking them from participating in transactions. This centralized control can be abused by a malicious owner to unfairly restrict access to the contract functionalities for certain users.",

        "vulnerability": "Potential for Locked Funds",
        "reason": "The swapBack function relies on external calls to swap tokens and add liquidity. If these external calls fail (e.g., due to slippage or insufficient liquidity), the function may not execute as expected, potentially resulting in locked funds within the contract. Additionally, failure in the `bensRevival.deposit` call is silently caught, which means that any issues in this process will not be surfaced, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.",
