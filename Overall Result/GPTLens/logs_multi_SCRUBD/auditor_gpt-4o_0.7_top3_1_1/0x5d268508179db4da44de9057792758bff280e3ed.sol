        "reason": "The fallback function allows the contract to receive Ether from any address without any restrictions.

        "vulnerability": "Unsafe withdrawal pattern",
        "reason": "Using `send` for transferring Ether is unsafe because it doesn't check for successful execution like `transfer` or `call`. If the recipient is a contract with a fallback function using more than 2300 gas, the transfer will fail, potentially locking funds in the contract. It also lacks a mechanism to handle failed transfers.",
