        "vulnerability": "Unsafe use of call with value",
        "reason": "The drain function uses low-level call with value, which forwards all gas to the callee. This can lead to reentrancy attacks, allowing the implementation address to repeatedly call drain and withdraw funds before the balance is updated. Additionally, using call.value() without checking for success can cause the contract to lose funds if the call fails.",

        "vulnerability": "Lack of access control on payable fallback",
        "reason": "The contract has a payable fallback function which allows anyone to send ether to the contract. While this is not inherently a vulnerability, it can result in unintended ether deposits. Coupled with the drain function vulnerability, an attacker could potentially use this to manipulate the contract's balance, making it a target for attacks aiming to execute the drain function.",

        "reason": "The constructor allows setting an arbitrary address as the implementation. If not properly managed or restricted during deployment, it can lead to unauthorized entities being set as the implementation, which can then exploit the drain function to transfer the contract's entire balance to themselves.",
