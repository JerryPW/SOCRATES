The code tries to update 'quotes' and 'quoteTimes' mappings with 'thisQuote', which will always be the default zero value for a string. This results in overwriting the same key repeatedly, leading to incorrect and potentially exploitable state updates.",

        "reason": "The function 'changeOwner' does not check whether 'newOwner' is a valid address (i.e., not zero address).

        "vulnerability": "Unsafe usage of send function",
        "reason": "The 'send' function is used to transfer ETH, which only forwards 2300 gas and can fail silently. If the transaction fails, the contract does not handle it, leaving the contract balance unchanged and potentially leading to unexpected behavior. Moreover, this can be exploited in scenarios with a fallback function that uses more than 2300 gas.",
