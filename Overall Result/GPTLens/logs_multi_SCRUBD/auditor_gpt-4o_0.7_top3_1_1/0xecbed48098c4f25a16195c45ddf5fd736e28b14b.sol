        "vulnerability": "Reentrancy",
        "reason": "The function allows for reentrancy attacks because the `transfer` function is called before transferring the remaining balance back to the sender. If any of the recipient contracts have a fallback function that calls back into this contract, it can exploit this vulnerability to drain funds.",

        "vulnerability": "Denial of Service (DoS)",
        "reason": "The function does not handle the case where the `send` operation fails. If one of the recipients is a contract that rejects ether, the entire transaction will fail, preventing funds from being distributed to other recipients.",

        "vulnerability": "Mismatched Array Lengths",
