        "vulnerability": "Lack of input validation",
        "reason": "There is no validation on the `_unlockTime` input, allowing users to set an unlock time that is in the past or at the current time, potentially bypassing intended lock mechanisms. Additionally, using `var` can lead to unexpected behavior due to type inference.",
