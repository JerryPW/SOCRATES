        "vulnerability": "Use of send() without checking result",
        "reason": "The send() function in Solidity only forwards a limited amount of gas and does not throw an error on failure. This can lead to situations where the payout fails, but the contract does not handle this failure, potentially leaving the contract in an inconsistent state or leading to unexpected behavior.",

        "vulnerability": "Lack of input validation for interestRate",
        "reason": "The interestRate parameter is not validated, allowing potentially unintended values. An attacker could exploit this by passing excessively high interest rates, causing the contract to calculate and attempt to pay out more interest than is available in the balance, potentially leading to incorrect state or financial loss.",

        "vulnerability": "Incorrect ether limit check",
        "reason": "The deposit function checks if msg.value is greater than or equal to 2, but it does not specify units, meaning it checks for a value of 2 wei instead of 2 ether. This allows deposits of less than 2 ether, potentially leading to incorrect assumptions about the amount of ether managed by the contract.",
