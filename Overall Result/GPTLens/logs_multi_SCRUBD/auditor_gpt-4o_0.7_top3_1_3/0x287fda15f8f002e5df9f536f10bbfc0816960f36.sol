        "vulnerability": "Reentrancy vulnerability",
        "reason": "The approveAndCall function allows an external contract to be called before the first function completes. This can be exploited by the external contract using reentrancy to call back into this contract and potentially manipulate the state in unexpected ways. Since the contract does not guard against reentrancy, an attacker could exploit this to, for example, change balances or allowances inappropriately.",

        "reason": "The buy function does not check for a minimum purchase amount, potentially allowing attackers to send minuscule amounts of Ether to the contract, causing it to perform unnecessary operations.
