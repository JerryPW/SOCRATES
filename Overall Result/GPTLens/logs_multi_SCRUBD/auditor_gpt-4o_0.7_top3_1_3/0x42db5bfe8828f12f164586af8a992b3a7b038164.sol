        "reason": "The function uses 'adr.send(this.balance)' to transfer Ether, which forwards only 2300 gas, possibly causing an Ether transfer failure without reverting the transaction. This could lock funds if the recipient is a contract with a fallback function that requires more than 2300 gas.",
