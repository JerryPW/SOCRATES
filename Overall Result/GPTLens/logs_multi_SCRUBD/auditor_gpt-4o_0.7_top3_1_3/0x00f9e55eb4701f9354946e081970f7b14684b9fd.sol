        "reason": "The `setSellTax` function allows the owner to set arbitrary values for sell taxes, which can be as high as 90% for the dev tax. This could be exploited by the owner to set extremely high sell taxes, effectively trapping users' tokens in the contract and preventing them from selling at a reasonable rate.",

        "vulnerability": "Potential misuse of `triggerTax` function",
        "reason": "The `triggerTax` function allows the owner to call `handleTax` directly, potentially manipulating the tax mechanism. Although the implementation checks for tax amounts, the owner can still trigger tax calculations at any time, potentially causing unexpected behavior or disrupting token transfers.",

        "reason": "The `burn` function is restricted to the owner, allowing them to burn tokens at will. While this may seem harmless, it gives the owner disproportionate control over the token supply and can be used to manipulate the token's market dynamics by reducing supply arbitrarily.",
