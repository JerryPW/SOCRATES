        "reason": "The ownerTransfer function calculates current_balance_all as the sum of current balances from the account_data mapping. However, it assumes that the total balance of the contract is always greater than this sum. This can lead to a situation where the owner can transfer more tokens than should be allowed, bypassing restrictions on token distribution.",

        "reason": "The tokenFallback function is missing a visibility modifier, which defaults to public in Solidity 0.4.21. This leaves the function accessible to anyone, potentially allowing unintended interactions with the contract.
