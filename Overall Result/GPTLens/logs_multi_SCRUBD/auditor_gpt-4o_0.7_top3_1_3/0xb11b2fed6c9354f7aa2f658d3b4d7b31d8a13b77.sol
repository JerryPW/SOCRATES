        "reason": "The 'Vault' function allows any external account to become the Owner of the DepositProxy contract by simply calling this function. This is because it sets the Owner to 'msg.sender' if 'msg.sender' is equal to 'tx.origin', which is always true for direct calls from external accounts. This allows an attacker to take control of the contract and potentially drain funds.",

        "reason": "The 'withdraw' function checks if 'msg.sender' has enough deposits but allows withdrawal by the Owner, not the depositor. This function can be exploited by an attacker who gains ownership of the contract to withdraw funds deposited by others, as the deposit check is incorrectly performed against 'msg.sender' instead of the Owner or against the correct depositor.",
