        "vulnerability": "Incorrect handling of approvals",
        "reason": "The approve function does not handle the race condition where a spender can use both the old and new allowance if the owner changes it using approve. This allows a spender to potentially double-spend the tokens. A safer pattern is to require the allowance to be set to zero before setting a new value, or use increaseAllowance and decreaseAllowance functions.",

        "reason": "The withdrawEth function transfers Ether to the wallet without guarding against reentrancy attacks.

The function should use a reentrancy guard or ensure that state changes (like setting the balance to zero) occur before the transfer.",

        "reason": "The removeAssetsOwner function decreases assetOwnersIndexes without considering if the index actually corresponds to an existing asset owner.
