        "vulnerability": "Lack of access control on contractOwner transfer",
        "reason": "The withdraw function allows the contractOwner to transfer all of the contract's balance to themselves without any restrictions or conditions. If the contractOwner's account is compromised, an attacker could easily drain the entire balance of the contract. This function should include mechanisms such as multi-signature or time-locks to prevent unauthorized or accidental withdrawals.",

        "vulnerability": "Unsafe use of send function",
        "reason": "The updateAd function uses the send method to transfer ether, which sends a limited amount of gas and does not throw an error if the transfer fails. This can lead to loss of funds if the recipient is a contract that requires more gas to execute its fallback function, or if it rejects the funds for any reason. It is safer to use the transfer method or call.value()(), which throw an error on failure and can handle reentrancy better.",

        "vulnerability": "Arbitrary updates to theInvestor and increasing investmentMin",
        "reason": "The updateInvestor function allows any address to become theInvestor by sending a sufficient amount of ether and also doubles the investmentMin each time it is called. This can lead to theInvestor being set to an unintended address, potentially controlled by an attacker. Additionally, the exponential increase in investmentMin could make future updates unaffordable or impractical. This function should include checks and balances to ensure updates are intentional and sustainable.",
