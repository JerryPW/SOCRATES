        "vulnerability": "Unchecked Allowance Subtraction",
        "reason": "The `transferFrom` function does not check if the allowance is sufficient before performing the subtraction `_allowances[sender][_msgSender()] - amount`. This may lead to integer underflow in older Solidity versions, although in Solidity 0.8.0 and above, it will revert the transaction. Nonetheless, it is best practice to include an explicit check for allowance sufficiency to ensure clarity and prevent potential issues if the code is adapted or reused in a different context.",

        "vulnerability": "Reentrancy Risk During Swap",
        "reason": "The function `_transfer` includes a token swap that can call external contracts. This modifies the contract's state (balances) after the external call, which can introduce reentrancy vulnerabilities. Although the `inSwapAndLiquify` flag is used to prevent reentrancy, the logic for state updates and external calls should still be carefully reviewed to ensure no reentrancy can occur.",

        "vulnerability": "Potential For Unauthorized Token Extraction",
        "reason": "The `claimStuckTokens` function allows the owner to extract any ERC20 tokens from the contract, which can be dangerous if the owner account is compromised. While this is intended to recover 'stuck' tokens, it essentially gives the owner control over any tokens sent to the contract, which might not align with user expectations or the intended tokenomics. This function should be carefully managed and possibly restricted with additional security measures.",
