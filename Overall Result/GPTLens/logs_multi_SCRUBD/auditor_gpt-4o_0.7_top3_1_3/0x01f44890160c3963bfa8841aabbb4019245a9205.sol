        "vulnerability": "Ownerless Contract Vulnerability",
        "reason": "The `renounceOwnership` function allows the current owner to relinquish control over the contract, setting the owner address to zero. This can lead to an ownerless contract where no one can perform privileged operations, potentially freezing certain functionalities that require owner intervention. If the owner calls this function without a robust plan for future governance, it could render the contract unmanageable.",

        "vulnerability": "Centralized Control Risk",
        "reason": "The `setBots` function allows the owner to mark any address as a bot, effectively blocking it from participating in transfers. This introduces a risk of centralization where the owner can arbitrarily blacklist any address, potentially for malicious reasons, such as censoring valid users or competitors. This power can be exploited if the owner becomes malicious or if their account is compromised.",

        "vulnerability": "Single Address Control of Funds",
        "reason": "The `manualsend` function allows only `_feeAddrWallet1` to trigger the distribution of ETH from the contract balance. This creates a single point of failure where if `_feeAddrWallet1` is compromised, an attacker could drain the contract's ETH balance. Furthermore, it centralizes control over a potentially significant amount of funds, which could be misused.",
