        "vulnerability": "Ownership Renouncement",
        "reason": "The `renounceOwnership` function allows the current owner to relinquish control over the contract permanently by setting the owner address to zero. This makes it impossible for any future administrative actions or upgrades, potentially leading to the contract being stuck in a state that cannot be changed, which could be exploited if the contract requires active management or updates.",

        "vulnerability": "Restricted Fund Withdrawal",
        "reason": "The `manualsend` function allows only the address `_feeAddrWallet1` to withdraw all ETH balances from the contract. This centralizes control over the funds, which could be exploited if the controlling address is compromised or acts maliciously, thereby draining the contract funds without any checks or balances.",
