        "reason": "The use of the send method for transferring Ether is problematic due to its limited gas stipend, which could potentially lead to a failed transfer and a loss of funds. Furthermore, there is no check on the success of the send operation, which could lead to silent failures where funds are not transferred as intended.",

        "reason": "The restriction that msg.sender must be the nonFungibleContract address is incorrect for the bid function, as this function is supposed to be called by users who wish to place bids on auctions.
