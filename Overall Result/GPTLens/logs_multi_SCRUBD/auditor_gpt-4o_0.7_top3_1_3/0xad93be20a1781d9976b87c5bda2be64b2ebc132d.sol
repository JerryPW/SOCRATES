        "reason": "The 'withdraw' function uses 'send' to transfer Ether, which forwards only 2300 gas and can fail silently. If the receiving contract has a fallback function that requires more than 2300 gas, the transfer will fail and the Ether will remain locked in the contract. Although reentrancy is less likely due to the 'onlyOwner' modifier, using 'call.value()' with proper reentrancy protection is a better practice to prevent any potential issues and ensure the transfer is successful.",
