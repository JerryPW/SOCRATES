        "reason": "The payout function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. This is because it makes an external call to the participant's address using send/call, and updates the participant's payout after the call. An attacker could use a fallback function to recursively call payout and deplete funds.",

        "reason": "This function allows the contract owner to transfer any ERC20 tokens held by the contract to themselves, except for the POWH token.
