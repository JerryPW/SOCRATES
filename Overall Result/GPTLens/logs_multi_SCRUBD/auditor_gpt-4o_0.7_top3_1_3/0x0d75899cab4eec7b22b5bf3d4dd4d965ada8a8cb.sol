        "reason": "The _transfer function, called within transfer, involves multiple state updates and external calls (e.g., emit Transfer events), which could be manipulated through a reentrancy attack if an attacker manages to call back into the contract. This is especially concerning as the contract does not use any checks-effects-interactions pattern to mitigate this risk.",

        "reason": "The unstuckETH function allows the owner to withdraw all the Ether from the contract to any address. If the owner's private key is compromised, an attacker can drain all Ether from the contract. This centralized control poses a risk to the funds stored in the contract.",

        "reason": "The swapForTokenomics function bundles multiple operations that may lead to high gas consumption.
