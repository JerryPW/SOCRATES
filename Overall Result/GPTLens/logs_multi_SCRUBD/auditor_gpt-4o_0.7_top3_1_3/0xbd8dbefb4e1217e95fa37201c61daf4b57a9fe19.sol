This can lead to a situation where the transfer fails (e.g., due to insufficient balance), but the Airdrop contract is unaware and assumes success. It may result in logical errors or incorrect state assumptions, leading to potential loss of funds or incorrect airdrop distributions.",

        "vulnerability": "Unsafe use of 'send'",
        "reason": "The 'withdraw' function uses 'send', which only forwards 2300 gas and does not propagate the error if the send fails. This can cause ether to be stuck in the contract if the recipient is a contract with a complex fallback function that requires more than 2300 gas to execute. It should use 'transfer' or handle the return value of 'send' to ensure proper error handling.",
