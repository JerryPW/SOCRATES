        "vulnerability": "Reentrancy vulnerability",
        "reason": "The CashOut function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks because it transfers funds to the caller using msg.sender.call.value(_am)() before updating the user's balance. An attacker can exploit this by calling CashOut recursively before the balance is updated, allowing them to withdraw more funds than they have deposited.",

        "reason": "The constructor allows setting an arbitrary address for the TransferLog contract. If an attacker deploys a malicious contract and passes its address during the instantiation of PrivateBank, they can execute arbitrary code when AddMessage is called, potentially leading to loss of funds or denial of service.",

        "reason": "The AddMessage function is publicly accessible, allowing any user to add arbitrary messages to the log.
