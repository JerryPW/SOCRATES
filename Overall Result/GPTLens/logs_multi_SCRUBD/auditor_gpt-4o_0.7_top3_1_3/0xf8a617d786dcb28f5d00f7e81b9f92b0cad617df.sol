        "vulnerability": "Unsafe use of send() for Ether transfer",
        "reason": "The withdraw function uses the send() method to transfer Ether, which forwards only a limited amount of gas and does not revert if the transfer fails. This can lead to Ether being stuck in the contract if the recipient is a contract with a fallback function that requires more gas than provided by send(). Additionally, since the function does not check the result of send(), it could lead to inconsistencies in the contract state if the transfer fails.",

        "vulnerability": "Lack of zero-address validation",
        "reason": "The transfer function does not check whether the 'to' address is the zero address (0x0).
