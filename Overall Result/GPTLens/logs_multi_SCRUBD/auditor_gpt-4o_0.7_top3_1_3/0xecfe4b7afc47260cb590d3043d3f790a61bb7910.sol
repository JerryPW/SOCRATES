        "vulnerability": "Lack of checks on token availability",
        "reason": "The function does not verify if the contract has enough tokens to distribute to all addresses in the input array. This can lead to a situation where the contract attempts to transfer more tokens than it owns, causing failed transactions or unexpected behavior.",
