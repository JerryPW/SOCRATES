        "reason": "The forceSend function transfers all ETH balance from the contract to a specified feeWallet using a low-level call without any reentrancy protection. This can be exploited by attackers who manage to manipulate the call stack to re-enter the function, potentially draining funds if the feeWallet address is controlled by an attacker. Additionally, the success variable is always set to false, ignoring the actual outcome of the call.",

These conditions depend on block numbers and timestamps which can be manipulated by miners or anticipated by attackers to execute advantageous trades or restrict legitimate transactions. Also, the use of variables like transferDelayEnabled and _holderLastTransferTimestamp can inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities that attackers might exploit to execute trades ahead of legitimate users.",
