        "reason": "The function `openTrading` is controlled by the contract owner and sets the `isOpen` flag to true, which enables trading. It also calls the internal function `_d()` that sets `treasuryFeeBPS` to 9800 and `liquidityFeeBPS` to 0, resulting in an extremely high total fee of 98%. This can be manipulated by the owner to drain value from users trading the token.",

        "reason": "The internal function `_d()` sets the treasury fee to 9800 basis points, equivalent to 98%, and the liquidity fee to 0. This results in a total fee of 98% on transactions, which is excessive and can be considered malicious as it allows the contract owner to extract value from token holders through high fees.",

This functionality can be exploited by the owner to move funds out of the contract without the consent or knowledge of token holders, potentially draining the contract's balance.",
