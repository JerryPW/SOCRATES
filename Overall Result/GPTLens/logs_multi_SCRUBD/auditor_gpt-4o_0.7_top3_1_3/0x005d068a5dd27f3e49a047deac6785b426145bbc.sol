        "vulnerability": "Ownership renouncement risk",
        "reason": "The `renounceOwnership` function allows the current owner to set the owner address to the zero address, effectively making the contract ownerless. While this is sometimes desired, it can also lead to a lack of control over the contract, making it impossible to perform any owner-only actions in the future, such as updating parameters, fixing bugs, or pausing the contract in case of an emergency.",

        "vulnerability": "Single point of control for ETH transfer",
        "reason": "The `manualsend` function allows the `_feeAddrWallet1` address to transfer the entire ETH balance of the contract to the designated fee addresses. This creates a centralization risk where if `_feeAddrWallet1` is compromised, an attacker could drain the contract's ETH balance. Adding additional controls or multi-signature requirements could mitigate this risk.",

        "vulnerability": "Potential denial of service via bot list",
        "reason": "The `setBots` function allows the contract owner to mark addresses as bots, potentially restricting their ability to interact with the contract. This could be misused to arbitrarily blacklist addresses, leading to a denial of service for those users. It could also be used maliciously to target specific users without any due process or decentralized governance.",
