        "vulnerability": "Incorrect Ether deposit condition",
        "reason": "The deposit function checks if msg.value is greater than or equal to 2, but there is no unit specified, so this condition allows deposits with extremely low ether values (2 wei instead of 2 ether). This can lead to very small deposits being allowed, which might be unintended and could complicate contract logic or allow exploitation of low-value deposits.",

        "vulnerability": "Potential reentrancy vulnerability",
        "reason": "The use of recipient.send(weiAmount) in the payout function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks because send only forwards 2300 gas, potentially allowing the recipient to re-enter the contract if they implement a fallback function. Although the use of send limits gas forwarding, it is generally safer to use transfer or checks-effects-interactions pattern to prevent this type of vulnerability.",

        "vulnerability": "Lack of interest rate validation",
        "reason": "There is no validation on the interestRate parameter in the payInterest function. This means that an attacker with control over one of the authorized addresses (creator, Owner0, or Owner1) could set an extremely high interest rate, draining the contract's funds through excessive interest payouts.",
