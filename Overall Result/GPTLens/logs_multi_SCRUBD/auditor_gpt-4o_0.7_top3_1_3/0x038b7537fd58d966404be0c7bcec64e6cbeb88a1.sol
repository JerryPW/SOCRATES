        "reason": "The `renounceOwnership` function allows the owner to renounce ownership by setting the owner address to zero. This can lead to the contract becoming ownerless, which could be problematic if there are functions that require owner privileges. Once ownership is renounced, it cannot be reclaimed, and important functions may become permanently inaccessible.",

        "reason": "The `startTrading` function allows the owner to add liquidity to the Uniswap pool without restrictions. If the owner is malicious or the private key is compromised, they can manipulate the liquidity or execute this function multiple times, affecting the token's market dynamics.",
