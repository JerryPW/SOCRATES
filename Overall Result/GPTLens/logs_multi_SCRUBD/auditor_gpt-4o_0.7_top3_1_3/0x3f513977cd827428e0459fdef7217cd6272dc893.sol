After the `kittenContract.transfer` call, an attacker can potentially re-enter the fallback function if `kittenContract` is a malicious contract that calls back into the fallback function. This can allow the attacker to drain more tokens than intended because the state changes (like updating `participants` or `kittensRemainingToDrop`) occur after the external call.",
