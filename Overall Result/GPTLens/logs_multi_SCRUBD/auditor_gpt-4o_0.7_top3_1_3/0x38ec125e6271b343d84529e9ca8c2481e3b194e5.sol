        "reason": "Renouncing ownership sets the owner to zero address, which is irreversible, potentially locking out any future administrative actions that require owner privileges. This can include changing tax rates, updating liquidity pairs, or enabling contract swaps, which could be detrimental to the contract's operation if changes are needed.",

This misconfiguration can lead to loss of funds during swaps or liquidity provision, as the contract would interact with an unintended or malicious DEX.",
