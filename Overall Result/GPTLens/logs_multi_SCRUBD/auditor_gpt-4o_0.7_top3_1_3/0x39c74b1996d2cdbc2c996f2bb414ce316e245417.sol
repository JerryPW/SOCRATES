        "reason": "The function uses the 'send' method, which forwards a limited amount of gas and does not revert on failure. This can lead to loss of funds if the recipient is a contract that requires more gas to execute its fallback function or if it rejects the transfer due to other reasons. It's safer to use 'transfer' or call with proper error handling.",
