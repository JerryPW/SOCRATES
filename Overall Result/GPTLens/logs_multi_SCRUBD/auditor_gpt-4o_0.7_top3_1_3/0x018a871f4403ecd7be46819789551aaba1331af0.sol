        "vulnerability": "Ownership renouncement leads to loss of control",
        "reason": "The renounceOwnership function allows the owner to set the owner address to zero, effectively making the contract ownerless. This can be problematic as it will result in the loss of administrative control over the contract, preventing the execution of any owner-only functions and the potential for contract upgrades or emergency interventions.",

        "vulnerability": "Potential centralization risk with manual swap",
        "reason": "The manualswap function allows a specific address (_feeAddrWallet1) to swap all the contract's token balance for ETH. This indicates a centralization risk where the designated address has significant control over the contract's funds, which could be exploited if the address is compromised or if the owner acts maliciously.",

        "vulnerability": "Centralization risk with funds withdrawal",
        "reason": "Similar to manualswap, the manualsend function allows a specific address (_feeAddrWallet1) to withdraw all ETH from the contract.
