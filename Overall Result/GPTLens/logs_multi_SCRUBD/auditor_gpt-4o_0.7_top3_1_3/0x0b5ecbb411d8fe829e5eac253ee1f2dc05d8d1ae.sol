        "reason": "The `withdrawStuckETH` function allows the owner to withdraw all ETH from the contract balance, but only if trading hasn't started. If there is any issue with the contract that requires ETH to resolve, and trading has already started, this function cannot be used to withdraw ETH, potentially leading to a situation where funds are indefinitely stuck or the contract becomes unusable.",
