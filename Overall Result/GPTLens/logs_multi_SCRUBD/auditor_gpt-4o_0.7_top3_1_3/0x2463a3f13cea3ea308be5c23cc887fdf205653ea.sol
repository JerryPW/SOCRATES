        "vulnerability": "Unrestricted approval vulnerability",
        "reason": "The function calls `approve` with `tokenAmount` for the contract itself without any conditional checks. If this function is called with a very large `tokenAmount`, it could inadvertently allow the entire token balance to be swapped for ETH, especially if called in the wrong context or if the function is exposed to external calls through other vulnerabilities. This could lead to an unintended transfer of tokens and potential loss of funds.",

        "vulnerability": "Lack of gas limit in loop",
        "reason": "This function iterates over an array of addresses, and for each address, it transfers a specified amount of tokens. If `_airdropAddresses` is a very large array, this could exceed the block gas limit and cause the transaction to fail. Moreover, without a mechanism to limit the number of addresses processed in one transaction, this function is susceptible to denial of service attacks by inputting a large array.",

        "vulnerability": "Lack of gas limit in loop",
        "reason": "Similar to `massDistributeTokens`, this function iterates over an array of addresses and transfers specified token amounts. If either `_airdropAddresses` or `_airdropAmounts` arrays are extremely large, the transaction could run out of gas. The absence of a mechanism to limit the iteration within a single transaction could lead to denial of service or failed transactions due to block gas limits.",
