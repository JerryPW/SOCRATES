        "reason": "The `removeLimits` function allows the owner to remove transaction and wallet limits, setting both to the total token supply.

        "reason": "The `transferOwnership` function allows the current owner to transfer ownership to any address without additional checks or approvals.

        "vulnerability": "Reentrancy risk",
        "reason": "The `_sendViaCall` function uses low-level call to send ETH, which is susceptible to reentrancy attacks. If the recipient contract has a fallback function or another function that re-enters the Cave contract, it could exploit this to drain funds or disrupt the contract logic.",
