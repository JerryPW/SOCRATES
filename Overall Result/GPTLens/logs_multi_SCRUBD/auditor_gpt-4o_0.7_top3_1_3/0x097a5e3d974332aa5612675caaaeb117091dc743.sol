        "reason": "The function 'setOwnerWallet' is marked as internal and can be called from within the contract or its derived contracts. However, it does not have any access control checks, which could allow unauthorized changes to the 'tokenOwner' variable if called from an insecure context within the contract.",

        "vulnerability": "Lack of input validation",
        "reason": "The 'transferOwnership' function allows the current owner to transfer ownership to any address, including zero address or other contracts that might not support ownership. This can lead to loss of control over the contract, as the new owner might not be able to execute owner-only functions.",

        "vulnerability": "Inefficient approval mechanism",
        "reason": "The function 'swapTokensForEth' calls 'approve' every time it is executed, which is inefficient and can lead to increased gas costs. In addition, there is a potential race condition if another transaction is mined between the approval and the swap, which could exploit the approved amount.",
