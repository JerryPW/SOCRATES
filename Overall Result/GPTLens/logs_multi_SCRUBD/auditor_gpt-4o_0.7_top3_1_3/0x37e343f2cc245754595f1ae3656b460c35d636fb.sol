Additionally, the `newOwnerCandidate` is set to address(0) after the `owner` is updated, which leads to incorrect event logging.",

        "reason": "The `tokenFallback` function assumes that the `_amount` can be safely cast to `uint64` without overflow checks. If the transferred `_amount` exceeds the maximum value of `uint64`, it will wrap around, leading to incorrect balance calculations.",
