        "vulnerability": "Unsafe use of send for transferring Ether",
        "reason": "The use of send to transfer Ether is unsafe because it only forwards 2300 gas, which may not be sufficient for the receiving contract to execute its fallback function. This could lead to Ether being locked in the contract if the recipient's fallback function requires more than 2300 gas. Additionally, send returns false on failure, which is not handled in this function, potentially leading to silent failures and the loss of funds.",

        "vulnerability": "Missing access control",
        "reason": "The sweepToken function can be called by anyone, not just the owner of the contract. This means that any user can trigger the transfer of all ERC20 tokens held by the contract to the owner's address. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to drain all tokens from the contract.",

        "vulnerability": "Potential for Reentrancy",
        "reason": "While the function is protected by the onlyOwner modifier, it lacks checks-effects-interactions pattern. The for loop transfers multiple tokens in a single transaction, which could open up opportunities for reentrancy if the ERC721 contract being called is malicious or buggy. If the transfer function of the token allows for reentrancy, it could interfere with the loop's execution and lead to unintended behaviors.",
