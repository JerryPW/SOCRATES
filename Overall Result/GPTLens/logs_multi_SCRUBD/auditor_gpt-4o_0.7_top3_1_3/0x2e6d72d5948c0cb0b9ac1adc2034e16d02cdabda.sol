        "vulnerability": "Anyone can disable swap and liquify",
        "reason": "The function `changeSwapBackSettings` allows any caller to disable the `swapAndLiquifyEnabled` flag, which controls the swap and liquify process. This function does not have an `onlyOwner` modifier, meaning it can be called by any address. An attacker could exploit this by repeatedly disabling the swap and liquify functionality, potentially causing disruptions in liquidity management and affecting the token's market operations.",

        "vulnerability": "Incorrect fee calculation logic",
        "reason": "In the `takeFee` function, the calculation of `feeApplicable` includes the subtraction of `_sellLpFee / feeDenominator` from `_sellTotalFees` when `recipient` is the `pair`. This logic seems incorrect because `_sellLpFee` is derived from the contract's balance, which is unrelated to the intended fee calculation. This could lead to erroneous fee deductions, especially if the contract's balance is high, potentially allowing large transactions to incur unexpectedly low fees or even negative fees, leading to a potential loss of funds for the protocol.",

        "vulnerability": "Lack of allowance change mitigation",
        "reason": "The `approve` function directly sets the allowance for a spender without considering the previous allowance value. This lack of mitigation against the 'race condition' problem (also known as the 'ERC20 approve/transferFrom race condition') can be exploited by an attacker. If a spender monitors the blockchain and sees an allowance increase transaction, they could quickly spend the current allowance before the new allowance takes effect, potentially causing unexpected behavior and unwanted token transfers.",
