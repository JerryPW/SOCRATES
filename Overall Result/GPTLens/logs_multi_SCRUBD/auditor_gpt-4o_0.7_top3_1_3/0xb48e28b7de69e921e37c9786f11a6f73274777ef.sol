        "vulnerability": "Reentrancy vulnerability",
        "reason": "The fallback function sends ether to the beneficiary before setting amountRaised to zero.

The state update should occur before sending ether to mitigate this vulnerability.",

        "vulnerability": "Misuse of send() and lack of checks",
        "reason": "The use of beneficiary.send(amountRaised) is dangerous as send() only forwards 2300 gas and does not throw errors on failure, potentially leading to loss of funds if the send fails. Additionally, the function does not check the return value of send(), which is crucial for detecting failed transactions and taking appropriate action.",
