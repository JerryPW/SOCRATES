        "reason": "The calculation of `tobesent = amount/price` and `tobesent*10e7` can lead to an integer overflow or underflow, especially when dealing with large values or unexpected inputs. This vulnerability can be exploited to create a situation where the actual token transfer is much larger or smaller than intended, potentially leading to loss of funds.",

        "vulnerability": "Use of `send` instead of `transfer`",
        "reason": "The `send` method is used to transfer Ether to the owner. However, `send` only forwards 2300 gas and does not revert on failure. This can lead to funds being stuck in the contract if the fallback function of the recipient requires more than 2300 gas or if the recipient is a contract that rejects the funds. Using `transfer` or checking the return value of `send` is recommended to ensure successful transfers.",

        "vulnerability": "Lack of input validation",
        "reason": "The `updateOwner` function does not validate the `newOwner` address. An accidental or malicious call could set the `owner` to the zero address, effectively locking the contract or transferring control to an unintended party. Input validation should be added to ensure `newOwner` is a valid address.",
