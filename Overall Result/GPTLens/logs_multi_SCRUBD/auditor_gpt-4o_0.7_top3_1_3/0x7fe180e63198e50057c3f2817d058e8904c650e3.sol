        "reason": "The refundTicket function uses send, which forwards only a limited amount of gas and does not throw on failure. This can lead to situations where an attacker blocks refunds by using a fallback function that consumes more gas than send provides, preventing the contract from functioning as intended.",

        "reason": "The destroy function allows the organizer to call suicide at any time, which will destroy the contract and send all its funds to the organizer's address. This can lead to a loss of funds for all participants, as there is no mechanism to ensure that all obligations (such as refunds) have been met before destruction.",
