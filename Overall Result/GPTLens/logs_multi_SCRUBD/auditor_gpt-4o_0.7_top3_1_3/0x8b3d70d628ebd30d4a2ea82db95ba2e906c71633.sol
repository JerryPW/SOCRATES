        "reason": "The function uses 'send' to transfer Ether, which forwards a limited amount of gas and can be subject to reentrancy attacks if the 'to' address is a contract and makes a recursive call back to withdrawEther. Since there is no reentrancy guard, this could allow an attacker to drain the contract's Ether balance.",
