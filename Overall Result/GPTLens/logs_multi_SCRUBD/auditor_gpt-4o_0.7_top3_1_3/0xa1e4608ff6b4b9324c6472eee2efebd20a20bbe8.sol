This order allows an attacker to exploit the function by using a reentrant call to repeatedly invoke the fallback function, potentially draining all the tokens allocated for a drop.

        "reason": "This function allows the owner to transfer all KittenCoin tokens from the contract to their own address. If the owner executes this function without careful consideration of the remaining token distribution plan, it can lead to a situation where participants can no longer receive tokens from the contract, effectively locking out future distribution. A better approach might include locking this function until after a certain period or ensuring that there are no scheduled distributions before allowing withdrawal.",
