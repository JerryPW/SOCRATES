        "vulnerability": "Lack of balance check and reentrancy risk",
        "reason": "There is no check to ensure that the contract has sufficient balance before transferring 'amount' to each address in '_tos'. This could lead to failed transactions or partial fund transfers. Additionally, the use of .transfer() without reentrancy protection presents a risk if any of the recipients is a contract with a fallback function that calls back into this contract.",

        "vulnerability": "Unsafe external call without return value check",
        "reason": "The function uses the low-level call without checking the return value, which can lead to potential loss of funds if the call fails.
