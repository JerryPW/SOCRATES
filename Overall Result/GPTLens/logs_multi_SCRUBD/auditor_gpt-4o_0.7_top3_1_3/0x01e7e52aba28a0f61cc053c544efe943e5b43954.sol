        "vulnerability": "Irreversible Ownership Renouncement",
        "reason": "The `renounceOwnership` function allows the contract owner to set the owner address to zero, effectively renouncing ownership permanently. Once ownership is renounced, no one can call functions protected by the `onlyOwner` modifier, including critical functions such as `setMaxTxPercent`. This could lead to the inability to adjust important settings, potentially locking the contract in a non-optimal state.",

        "vulnerability": "Unsafe Ether Transfer",
        "reason": "The `sendETHToFee` function directly transfers Ether using `.transfer()`, which forwards only 2300 gas and can lead to reentrancy vulnerabilities if the recipient is a contract with a fallback function requiring more gas. Though it appears safe here due to trusted addresses, this is generally considered a bad practice and can cause issues if those addresses are changed to contracts with complex logic.",

        "vulnerability": "Potential Front-running",
        "reason": "The `manualswap` function allows the `_teamAddress` to swap all tokens held by the contract for ETH. This can be exploited through front-running, where an attacker predicts the swap and buys tokens just before the swap, then sells them at a higher price after the swap when the token balance is reduced. This can result in significant profit for the attacker at the expense of the token's value and other holders.",
