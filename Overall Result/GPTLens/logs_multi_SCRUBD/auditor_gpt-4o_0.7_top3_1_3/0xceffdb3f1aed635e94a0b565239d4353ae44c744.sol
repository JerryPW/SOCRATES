        "reason": "The withdraw function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. The function sets the user's balance to 0 after transferring the amount. If an attacker creates a contract that calls withdraw and contains a fallback function to call withdraw again before the initial call completes, the attacker can repeatedly withdraw funds before their balance is set to zero.",

If the 'sale' address is incorrect or becomes malicious, all Ether sent to the contract can be lost. Additionally, there are no access controls on who can call this function, allowing anyone to trigger the purchase at any time.",

        "vulnerability": "Incorrect Token Calculation and Transfers",
        "reason": "The fallback function calculates the token amount as balances[msg.sender] * 100, which assumes a fixed rate without validation. If the rate changes or is incorrect, it could lead to incorrect token distribution. Furthermore, the function attempts to transfer tokens without ensuring the contract has sufficient tokens, potentially causing failed transactions or loss of funds. The immediate refund of msg.value also allows potential manipulation of internal balances leading to incorrect token claims.",
