        "reason": "The signal function sends ether to an address without implementing checks-effects-interactions pattern. If addr is a contract, the fallback function of that contract may call back into signal, causing reentrancy issues.

        "vulnerability": "Use of deprecated send method",
        "reason": "The signal function uses the .send() method for sending ether, which only forwards 2300 gas, potentially causing transaction failures if the recipient requires more gas for execution. This can be exploited by attackers to lock funds in the contract by making the recipient address a contract that requires more gas than provided.",
