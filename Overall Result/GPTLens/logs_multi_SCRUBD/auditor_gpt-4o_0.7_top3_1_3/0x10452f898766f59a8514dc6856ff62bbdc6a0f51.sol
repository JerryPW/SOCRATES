        "reason": "The `Put` function uses `var` for the `acc` variable, which might not behave as expected due to potential storage/memory issues in Solidity 0.4.25. This can lead to overwriting or incorrect updating of the `Acc` mapping, potentially allowing manipulation of account balances.",

        "reason": "The fallback function automatically calls `Put(0)` allowing any Ether sent to the contract to be immediately deposited without a lock time. This can be exploited by attackers to manipulate the contract's state or interact with it in unintended ways, bypassing the intended use of `Put` with a specific unlock time.",
