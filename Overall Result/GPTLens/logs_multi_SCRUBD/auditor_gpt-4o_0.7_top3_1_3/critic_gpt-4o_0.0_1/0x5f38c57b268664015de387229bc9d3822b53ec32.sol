This could allow an attacker to re-enter the function and mint more cards than intended. However, the severity of this vulnerability depends on whether the `cards.mintCards` function itself is vulnerable to reentrancy. If it is not, the risk is mitigated. The profitability is potentially high if an attacker can exploit this to mint valuable cards. Implementing reentrancy guards or using the checks-effects-interactions pattern would be prudent.",
