The function uses msg.sender.transfer(amount), which is a safe way to transfer Ether and prevents reentrancy attacks because it forwards a limited amount of gas. However, the call to feeCollector.call.value(fee)() is vulnerable to reentrancy if the feeCollector is a contract that can reenter. The severity is moderate because it depends on the feeCollector's behavior, and the profitability is moderate as an attacker could potentially exploit this to drain the contract.",
