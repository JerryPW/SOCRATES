However, the function does include checks to ensure that the withdrawal can only occur if both stakes have failed, the ETH is still staked, and the token has not been minted. This is a design decision rather than a vulnerability, as it is intended to allow the administrator to reclaim funds in specific scenarios. The severity is moderate because it depends on the administrator's intentions, and the profitability is low for external attackers.",
