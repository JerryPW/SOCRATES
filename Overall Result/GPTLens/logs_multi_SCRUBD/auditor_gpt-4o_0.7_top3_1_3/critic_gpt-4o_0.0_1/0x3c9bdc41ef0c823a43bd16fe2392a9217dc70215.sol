However, this is a standard behavior in ERC20 token transfers, where the transferFrom function itself will revert if the allowance is insufficient. Therefore, while it may cause usability issues if users forget to set the allowance, it is not a security vulnerability. The severity is low as it does not lead to any security breach, and profitability is non-existent for an attacker.",

This could indeed bypass any intended locking mechanisms, which might be a design flaw if the contract is intended to enforce a minimum staking period.
