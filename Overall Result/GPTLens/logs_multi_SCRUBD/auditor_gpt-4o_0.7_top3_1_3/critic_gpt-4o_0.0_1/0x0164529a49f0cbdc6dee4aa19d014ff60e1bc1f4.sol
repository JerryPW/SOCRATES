However, the likelihood of reentrancy is dependent on whether the external addresses are contracts with malicious fallback or receive functions.

The profitability is moderate as well, as an attacker could potentially drain funds if they control one of the addresses.",

If either of these addresses is a contract with a fallback function or a receive function that performs further interactions with this contract, it may re-enter the `swapTokensForEth` function.
