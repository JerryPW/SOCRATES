This could indeed be exploited by a malicious owner to perform a rug-pull by launching the contract and adding liquidity without giving users time to react. However, this is more of a design choice rather than a vulnerability, as the owner is expected to have control over the launch process. The severity is moderate because it depends on the owner's intentions, and the profitability is moderate as well, as it could be exploited by the owner.",
