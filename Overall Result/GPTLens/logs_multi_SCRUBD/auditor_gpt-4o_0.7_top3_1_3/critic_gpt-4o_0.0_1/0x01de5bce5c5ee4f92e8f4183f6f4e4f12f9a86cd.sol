        "criticism": "The reasoning identifies a potential front-running risk, but the explanation lacks depth. The function is protected by a nonReentrant modifier, which mitigates reentrancy attacks but does not address front-running. However, the described scenario of an attacker front-running to withdraw before the original transaction is not entirely accurate, as the attacker would need to have a deposit to withdraw. The severity is low because the attack requires specific conditions and does not directly lead to loss of funds. Profitability is also low as the attacker cannot gain significant advantage without prior deposits.",

        "reason": "The `emergencyWithdraw` function allows users to withdraw their deposits after a lockup duration. An attacker could potentially monitor the mempool and try to front-run the transaction by executing a similar transaction to withdraw before the original transaction is mined.

The function relies on the _amountOutMin_tokenFeeBuyBack parameter to set a minimum acceptable output, but if market conditions change rapidly, the swap could result in fewer tokens than expected.
