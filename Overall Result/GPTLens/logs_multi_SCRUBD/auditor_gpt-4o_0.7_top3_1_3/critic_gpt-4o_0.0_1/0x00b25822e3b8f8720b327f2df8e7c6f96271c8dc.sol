However, the potential for reentrancy is limited because the function transfers the entire balance to the owner's address in a single call, and the owner is expected to be a trusted entity. The severity is moderate because if the owner's address is a contract with a fallback function, it could potentially exploit this. The profitability is low because it requires the owner's address to be a malicious contract, which is a less common scenario.",

This is a design decision rather than a vulnerability, as the owner is typically trusted. However, if the owner is compromised or malicious, this could lead to a significant loss for token holders.
