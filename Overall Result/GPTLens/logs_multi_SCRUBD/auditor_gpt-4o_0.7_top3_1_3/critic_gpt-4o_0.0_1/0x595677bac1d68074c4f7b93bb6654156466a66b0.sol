The .send() method only forwards 2300 gas, which can indeed cause problems if the recipient is a contract with a fallback function that requires more gas. This could lead to Ether being stuck in the contract. However, the severity is moderate because it depends on the recipient's contract design, and profitability is low as it requires specific conditions to exploit.",
