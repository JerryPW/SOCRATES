The fallback mechanism to send to '__owner' if the primary 'target' send fails is also correctly identified as a potential issue, as it could lead to funds being locked if both transfers fail. The severity is moderate because it can lead to funds being locked, but it is not easily exploitable for profit by an attacker.
