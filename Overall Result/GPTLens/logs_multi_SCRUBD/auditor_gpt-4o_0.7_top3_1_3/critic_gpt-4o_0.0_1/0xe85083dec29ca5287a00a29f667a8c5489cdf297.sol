This is a well-known issue in ERC20 token contracts. The suggested mitigation strategies, such as requiring the allowance to be set to zero before setting a new value or using increaseAllowance and decreaseAllowance functions, are valid. The severity is moderate because it can lead to double-spending, but it requires specific timing to exploit.
