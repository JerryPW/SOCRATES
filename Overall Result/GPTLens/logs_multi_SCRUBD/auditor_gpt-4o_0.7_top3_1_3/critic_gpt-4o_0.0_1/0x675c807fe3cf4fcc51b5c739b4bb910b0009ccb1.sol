The send() function only forwards 2300 gas, which may not be sufficient for contracts with complex fallback functions, leading to failed transactions. Additionally, the lack of error handling for the send() function means that if the transaction fails, the contract will not be aware, potentially resulting in funds being stuck. The severity is moderate because it can lead to loss of funds, but it is not easily exploitable by an external attacker. The profitability is low for the same reason.",
