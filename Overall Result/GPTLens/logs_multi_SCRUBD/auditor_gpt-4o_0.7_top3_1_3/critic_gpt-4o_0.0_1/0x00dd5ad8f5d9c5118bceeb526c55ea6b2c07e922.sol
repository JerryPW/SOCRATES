This is a significant vulnerability as it can be exploited by a malicious owner to drain the contract of its assets. The lack of checks to verify if tokens are genuinely 'stuck' exacerbates the risk. The severity is high because it directly affects the security of user funds. The profitability is also high for a malicious owner, as they can potentially withdraw all assets from the contract.",
