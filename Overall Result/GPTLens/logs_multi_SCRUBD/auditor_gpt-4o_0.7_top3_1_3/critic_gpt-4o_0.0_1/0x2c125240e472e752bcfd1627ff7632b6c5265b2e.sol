This can lead to unexpected behavior and is a clear misuse of the 'view' keyword. The severity is moderate because it can cause confusion and potential issues in contract behavior, but it does not directly lead to a security vulnerability.

The claim that it misses the equality case is incorrect, as the condition 'address(this).balance > amount' ensures that the contract has more than the specified amount before allowing the transfer.
