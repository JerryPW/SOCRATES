This could indeed lead to inflation and devaluation if the 'icebox' address is compromised. The severity is high because it affects the token's integrity and value.

However, since the function is restricted to the owner, the risk is somewhat mitigated unless the owner is a contract that can be manipulated.

This is a design decision rather than a vulnerability, as it is expected behavior for an owner to manage tokens. However, if ownership is compromised, it could lead to a loss of all tokens.
