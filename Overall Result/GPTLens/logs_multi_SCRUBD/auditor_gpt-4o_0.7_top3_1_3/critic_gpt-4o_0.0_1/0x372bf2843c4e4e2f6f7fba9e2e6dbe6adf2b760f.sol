However, the function is marked with lockTheSwap, which suggests a reentrancy guard might be in place, reducing the risk. The severity is moderate because if the guard fails or is improperly implemented, it could lead to exploitation. The profitability is moderate as well, as a successful reentrancy attack could allow an attacker to drain funds.",

        "reason": "The function `swapBack` transfers ETH to the `devWallet` before calling `hayReflections.deposit`.

This is a design decision rather than a vulnerability, but it does pose a risk to decentralization and trust. The severity is low because it does not directly lead to financial loss or exploitation.

        "reason": "The function `openTrading` is controlled by the contract owner, meaning the owner has the sole authority to enable or disable trading.
