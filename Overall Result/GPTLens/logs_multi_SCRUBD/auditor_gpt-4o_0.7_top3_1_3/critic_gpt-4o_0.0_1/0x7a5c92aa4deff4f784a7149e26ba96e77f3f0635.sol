This can lead to unexpected behavior if the send fails, as the contract will continue execution without handling the failure.

However, the profitability is low because an external attacker cannot exploit this directly for profit.",

This could allow a recipient to re-enter the contract and manipulate the state or extract additional funds. The severity is high because reentrancy attacks can lead to significant financial loss.
