While it is true that the function does not emit an event when a transfer fails, this is more of a logging issue than a security vulnerability. It does not directly lead to exploitation or financial loss, but it can indeed cause confusion and make debugging difficult. The severity is low because it does not affect the contract's security or functionality. The profitability is also low as it does not provide any financial gain to an attacker.",
