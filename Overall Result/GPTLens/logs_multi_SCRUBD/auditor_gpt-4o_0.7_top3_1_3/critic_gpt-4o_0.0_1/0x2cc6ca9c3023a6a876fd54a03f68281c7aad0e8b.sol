While the arithmetic operations could lead to rounding errors, the Solidity language handles overflows with the SafeMath library, which is not mentioned here. However, the lack of checks for successful transfers is a valid concern, as it could leave the contract in an inconsistent state if a transfer fails. The severity is moderate due to potential fund misallocation, and the profitability is low because exploiting this would require specific conditions and does not directly benefit an attacker.",

Specifically, transferring 33%, 50%, and the remaining balance without precise calculations can result in overflows or incorrect fund distribution. Additionally, these operations occur in sequence without checking for successful transfers, which could fail and leave the contract in an inconsistent state.
