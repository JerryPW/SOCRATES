If the transfer fails, the function will not detect it, potentially leading to a loss of funds for users who believe they have successfully purchased tokens. This is a significant issue because it can lead to user funds being locked or lost without any indication of failure. The severity is high due to the potential for user funds to be affected, and the profitability is moderate because an attacker could exploit this to cause financial loss to users.",

While it is true that if the owner is a contract, it could potentially have a fallback function, the risk of reentrancy is minimal because the function does not interact with any external contracts or state variables after the transfer.
