The function does calculate the payment for the Oraclize query without checking the contract's balance, which could lead to issues if the contract does not have enough funds to cover the query cost. However, the claim that this allows an attacker to call queries without paying necessary gas costs is incorrect, as the function does not allow external users to bypass gas costs. The severity is moderate because it could lead to denial of service if the contract runs out of funds, but profitability for an attacker is low.",
