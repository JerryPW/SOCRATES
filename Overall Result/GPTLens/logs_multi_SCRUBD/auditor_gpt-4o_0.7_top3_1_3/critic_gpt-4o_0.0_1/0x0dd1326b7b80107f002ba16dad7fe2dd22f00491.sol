Both methods indeed forward only 2300 gas, which can be insufficient for complex operations in the recipient contract. The use of 'send' is particularly concerning because it does not revert on failure, leading to silent failures. However, the severity is somewhat mitigated by the fact that only 1 wei is being transferred, which limits the potential impact. The profitability for an attacker is low, as they cannot directly exploit this to gain funds.",

Both 'transfer' and 'send' are not recommended as they forward only 2300 gas, which is insufficient for complex operations.
