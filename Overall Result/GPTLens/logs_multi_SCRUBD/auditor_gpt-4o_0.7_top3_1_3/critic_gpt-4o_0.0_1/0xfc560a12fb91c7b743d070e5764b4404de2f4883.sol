The use of `beneficiary.send(amountRaised)` can indeed lead to a reentrancy attack, as `send` only forwards 2300 gas, which might not be enough to call `safeWithdrawal` again. However, the main concern is that `send` is not a recommended method for transferring Ether due to its limited gas stipend. The reentrancy risk is more relevant if `call` or `transfer` were used. The severity is moderate because reentrancy could potentially allow multiple withdrawals, but the profitability is low since the function is restricted to the beneficiary.",
