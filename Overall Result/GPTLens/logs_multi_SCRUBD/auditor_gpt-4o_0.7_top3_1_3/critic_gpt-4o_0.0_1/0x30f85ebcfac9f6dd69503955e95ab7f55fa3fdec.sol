However, the described issue is not a vulnerability but rather a potential operational failure. If the token owner has not approved the contract to spend tokens, the transaction will simply revert, which is expected behavior. This does not lock any further operations, as the transaction would not be successful in the first place. The severity is low because it does not lead to any security breach, and profitability is non-existent as it does not allow for any exploit.",
