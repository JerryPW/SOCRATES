This is a classic reentrancy vulnerability, as an attacker could exploit this by calling withdraw again before the state is updated, allowing them to drain funds beyond their balance. The severity is high because it can lead to significant financial loss. The profitability is also high, as an attacker can potentially drain the contract's funds.",

The require(false) statement ensures that only specific amounts are accepted, which is a design choice rather than a flaw. However, the lack of an informative error message could be improved for better user experience.

However, it does not handle situations where msg.value is neither PRICE, PRICE * 5, or PRICE * 10, leading to a condition where require(false) is triggered, causing a revert without any informative error message.
