This does indeed centralize control and could be problematic if the address is compromised or acts maliciously. However, this is a design decision and not inherently a vulnerability. The severity is moderate because it depends on the trustworthiness of the privileged user. The profitability is low for external attackers, as they cannot exploit this without access to the privileged address.",
