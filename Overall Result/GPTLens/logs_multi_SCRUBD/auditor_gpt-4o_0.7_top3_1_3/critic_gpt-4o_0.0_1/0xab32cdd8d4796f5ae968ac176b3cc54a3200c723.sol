If the treasury address is a contract with a fallback function, it could indeed exploit this to perform a reentrancy attack. However, the severity is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the reentrancy would only affect the treasury transfer, not the token transfer, and the profitability depends on the treasury contract's behavior.
