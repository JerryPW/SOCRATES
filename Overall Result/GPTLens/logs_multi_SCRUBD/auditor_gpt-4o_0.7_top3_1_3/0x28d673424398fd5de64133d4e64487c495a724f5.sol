This allows an attacker to re-enter the function and perform multiple withdrawals in a single transaction. The attacker can exploit this by deploying a malicious contract with a fallback function that calls the vulnerable contract again, draining its funds.",

        "vulnerability": "Denial of Service (DoS) via gas limit",
        "reason": "The use of 'send' function to transfer Ether imposes a 2300 gas stipend limit, which may not be sufficient for the receiving contract to execute its fallback function correctly. If the recipient is a contract that requires more than 2300 gas to process the incoming Ether, the transaction will fail, leading to a denial of service for that specific contract address.",

        "vulnerability": "Incorrect Ether transfer logic",
        "reason": "The logic of transferring 'address(this).balance - msg.value' is inherently flawed. If multiple transactions are sent to the contract concurrently, they may affect the balance unexpectedly due to differences in transaction ordering and timing. This can lead to situations where more Ether than intended is sent to the msg.sender or even to failed transfers, depending on how quickly the balance updates between transactions.",
