        "reason": "The `renounceOwnership` function allows the owner to relinquish control of the contract by setting the owner to the zero address. This makes it impossible for any administrative functions that require the `onlyOwner` modifier to be executed thereafter. If the contract requires ongoing administrative actions, renouncing ownership can render the contract unmanageable and lead to vulnerabilities or the inability to respond to future changes or issues.",

        "vulnerability": "Lack of reentrancy protection",
        "reason": "The `_transferFrom` function performs multiple state changes (such as updating balances and potentially triggering swaps or buybacks) before finalizing the transfer. This function lacks a reentrancy guard, which could allow an attacker to exploit reentrancy by calling the transfer function repeatedly before previous calls are completed, potentially manipulating the state and leading to inconsistencies or loss of funds.",

        "reason": "The `swapBack` function involves external calls, particularly when sending ETH to the marketing fee receiver. This call does not have adequate checks for gas usage, relying on a fixed gas limit (30000). If the gas requirement of the recipient exceeds this limit, the transaction may fail, causing the contract to revert even if other operations are successful. Additionally, this can lead to potential denial of service attacks if the gas requirement increases over time.",
