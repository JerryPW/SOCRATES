        "reason": "The function uses the low-level call function to perform a token transfer, which does not check for the success of the call. This can lead to unintended behavior, as there's no guarantee that the token contract adheres to the ERC20 standard or that the transfer function exists. An attacker could exploit this by deploying a malicious contract that does not properly implement the transfer function, causing the system to behave unexpectedly or lose tokens.",

        "vulnerability": "Unsafe external call without checking return value",
        "reason": "The function uses _addr.call.value(_wei) to send Ether without checking if the call was successful. This can lead to vulnerabilities such as reentrancy attacks if the called contract has a fallback function that modifies state or calls back into the TokenBank contract. This could allow an attacker to repeatedly withdraw funds before the state is updated, draining the contract's balance.",

        "vulnerability": "Incorrect holder balance handling",
        "reason": "The function sets Holders[_to] to zero before calling WithdrawToken, regardless of whether the WithdrawToken operation is successful or not. This allows an attacker to potentially lose their balance without actually receiving tokens if the WithdrawToken call fails. This issue is compounded by the lack of error handling in WithdrawToken.",
