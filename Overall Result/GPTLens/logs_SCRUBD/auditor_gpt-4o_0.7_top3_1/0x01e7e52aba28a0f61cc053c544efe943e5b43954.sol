This action is irreversible and could lead to a situation where crucial functions can no longer be called, potentially locking funds or functionalities permanently.",

        "vulnerability": "Owner can arbitrarily block addresses",

        "reason": "The function allows swapping tokens for ETH without setting a minimum amount of ETH expected (amountOutMin = 0).
