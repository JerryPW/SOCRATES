        "vulnerability": "Constructor lacks proper visibility",
        "reason": "The constructor function BurnableOpenPayment is implicitly public due to its visibility not being explicitly declared. In Solidity versions prior to 0.4.22, function visibility defaults to public if not specified. This lack of explicit visibility declaration can lead to the contract being instantiated by unauthorized entities, which may not be the intended behavior. Specifying the constructor with explicit visibility (usually public) is a good practice to avoid potential misunderstandings and vulnerabilities.",

        "vulnerability": "Denial of service through recipient lock",
        "reason": "The commit function allows the first user to send a transaction with a value greater or equal to the commitThreshold to become the recipient. Once a recipient is set, no other address can become the recipient, thus preventing the contract from functioning for other users. This can be exploited to lock the contract's functionality for all other potential recipients, effectively leading to a denial of service for anyone else wanting to use the contract.",

        "code": "function burn(uint amount) onlyPayer() onlyWithRecipient() returns (bool) { return burnAddress.send(amount); }",
        "vulnerability": "Use of send can fail silently",
        "reason": "The burn function uses the send method to transfer ether to a burnAddress. The send method forwards a limited amount of gas and returns false on failure without reverting the transaction. This can lead to situations where the burn fails silently, potentially causing an inconsistency in contract state or funds not being burned as expected. To mitigate this, the transfer method or low-level call with proper error handling should be used.",
