        "vulnerability": "Owner can drain contract balance",
        "reason": "The cashOut function allows the owner of the contract to transfer the entire balance of the contract to their own address. This is a critical vulnerability as it enables the owner to withdraw all funds from the contract at any time, potentially leaving other participants or users without recourse to their deposited funds.",

        "vulnerability": "Irreversible loss of ownership control",
        "reason": "The renounceOwnership function sets the owner address to zero, effectively leaving the contract without an owner. This action is irreversible and means that any functions protected by the onlyOwner modifier can no longer be called. This includes critical functions like cashOut and transferOwnership, potentially rendering the contract unusable and funds permanently locked in certain scenarios.",

        "vulnerability": "Potential for reentrancy attack",
        "reason": "The depositOutput function involves transferring Ether back to the sender before updating the state variable 'deposits'. This sequence makes the function vulnerable to reentrancy attacks, where a malicious contract could repeatedly call depositOutput before the deposits mapping is updated, potentially gaining more tokens than intended and causing inconsistencies in the contract's state.",
