However, there is no check to ensure that the contract has enough tokens to fulfill the purchase. If the contract's balance is insufficient, the _transfer function will fail, and the buyer will lose their sent Ether without receiving tokens.",

        "vulnerability": "Unsafe Ether transfer to owner",
        "reason": "The fallback function directly sends Ether to the owner's address using owner.send(msg.value). This is unsafe because the send method only forwards a limited amount of gas (2300 gas), which may not be enough for the receiving contract to execute complex operations, potentially causing the transaction to fail. Additionally, there is no error handling if the send operation fails, which could lead to loss of funds.",

        "reason": "The selfdestructs function allows the contract owner to destroy the contract and transfer all remaining Ether to the owner's address. While it is protected by the onlyOwner modifier, there are no additional safeguards, such as a time delay or multisig approval, which could prevent accidental or malicious destruction of the contract.",
