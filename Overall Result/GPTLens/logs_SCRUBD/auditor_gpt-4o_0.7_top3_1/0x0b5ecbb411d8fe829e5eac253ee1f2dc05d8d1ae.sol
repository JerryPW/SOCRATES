        "reason": "The `withdrawStuckETH` function allows the owner to withdraw all ETH from the contract, but only if trading hasn't started. If trading is never started, or if the trading flag is manipulated, the ETH stuck in the contract could be locked indefinitely, leading to a denial of service for rightful withdrawal.",

        "vulnerability": "Forced token manipulation",
