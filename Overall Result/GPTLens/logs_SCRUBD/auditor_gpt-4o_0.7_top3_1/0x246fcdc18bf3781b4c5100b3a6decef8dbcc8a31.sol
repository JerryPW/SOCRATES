However, it does not utilize reentrancy protection mechanisms like mutex or the OpenZeppelin ReentrancyGuard. This could potentially allow an attacker to exploit reentrancy in the contract by recursively calling the _transfer function during the ether transfer process.",

While this is a useful feature for recovering tokens sent to the contract by mistake, it could be misused by a malicious owner to drain tokens from the contract, especially if there are no checks on the token type or amount being transferred.",

        "vulnerability": "Fee update centralization",
        "reason": "The setBuyFeePercentages() function allows the owner to adjust the buy fees, although it is capped at a maximum of 10%. This centralization of control means that the owner has significant power to alter the fee structure, which could be used maliciously to adjust fees to unfavorable levels for users. While the cap provides some protection, the potential for abuse still exists if the maximum allowable fee is too high.",
