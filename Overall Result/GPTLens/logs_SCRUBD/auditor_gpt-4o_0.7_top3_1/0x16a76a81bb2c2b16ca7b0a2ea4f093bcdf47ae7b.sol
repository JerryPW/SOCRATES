If an attacker can manipulate the token balance or ETH balance, they might execute arbitrary code during the external calls, leading to unexpected behaviors or fund loss. Although the lockTheSwap modifier is used to prevent direct reentrancy, the pattern of external calls is risky if other vulnerabilities exist.",

This can lead to scenarios where funds might not reach their intended destination if the call fails, without any feedback or retry mechanism. If the target addresses are unable to receive ETH (due to reverting fallback functions, for example), the funds will be stuck in the contract or lost.",
