        "vulnerability": "Use of send without proper error handling",
        "reason": "The withdrawEther function uses the send method to transfer Ether, which only forwards 2300 gas and does not revert on failure. This can lead to Ether being permanently locked in the contract if the recipient address is a contract that requires more than 2300 gas to execute its fallback function. Additionally, since the return value of send (a boolean) is not checked for successful execution, it can lead to silent failures without notifying the caller.",

        "vulnerability": "Setting owner to zero address",
        "reason": "The renounceOwnership function allows the owner to set the owner address to zero, effectively renouncing control over the contract. This can lead to a situation where the contract becomes unmanageable, as no one will have the authority to call onlyOwner functions. If the contract relies on the owner for critical functionality, it can become permanently unusable.",

        "vulnerability": "Assuming success on missing return value",
        "reason": "The eip20Transfer function assumes success if the return data size is zero, which is non-standard behavior. According to the ERC20 standard, a transfer function should return a boolean value indicating success. Assuming success when no return value is provided can lead to incorrect assumptions about the state of token transfers, potentially allowing token transfers that should have failed to be considered successful.",
