This can lead to failed transfers, causing the contract logic to behave unexpectedly as it does not check the success of the transfer.",

        "reason": "The 'Count' function iterates over the 'Tx' array using 'counter' as an index. However, it starts with 'counter' equal to 'Tx.length', which is out of bounds. This will lead to accessing an undefined index of the array, causing potential errors or unexpected behavior.",
