This creates a situation where an attacker could re-enter the contract before the state is updated, potentially leading to multiple token transfers or incorrect wei balances. Specifically, the wallet.transfer(etherBalance) call can trigger a fallback function in the receiving contract, allowing reentry before the function completes.",

        "reason": "The rescueTokens function allows the owner to transfer all tokens of any ERC20 token held by the contract to themselves or another address. While this is intended for recovering tokens, it can be abused by the owner to drain any tokens accidentally sent to the contract without a proper logging mechanism or checks on the token type. This can lead to loss of tokens that may have been sent to the contract for other purposes.",
