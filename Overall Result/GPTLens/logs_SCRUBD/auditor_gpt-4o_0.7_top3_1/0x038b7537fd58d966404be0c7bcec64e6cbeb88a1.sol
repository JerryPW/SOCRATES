        "reason": "The renounceOwnership function sets the owner to the zero address, effectively making the contract ownerless. This is dangerous as it means no one can execute owner-only functions thereafter, which could be critical for contract management and upgrades, especially if unforeseen issues arise that require owner intervention.",

        "vulnerability": "manualswap can be executed by the team without restrictions",
        "reason": "The function manualswap allows the team address to swap all of the contract's token balance for ETH without any restrictions on frequency or amount.

        "vulnerability": "manualsend can be executed by the team without restrictions",
        "reason": "Similar to manualswap, the manualsend function allows the team address to transfer all of the contract's ETH balance to predetermined addresses. There are no checks on the frequency or justification for these transfers, which could be misused to deplete contract funds without any accountability.",
