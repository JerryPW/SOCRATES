        "vulnerability": "Liquidity Pool Manipulation",
        "reason": "The burnTokensFromLiquidityPool function can be exploited by an attacker to manipulate token price and liquidity. If the attacker controls a significant portion of the liquidity, they can call this function to burn tokens from the liquidity pool, which may lead to price manipulation and potential profit from arbitrage. Additionally, since it directly interacts with the liquidity pool without adequate checks, it could destabilize the pool.",

        "reason": "The blockUnblockAddress function allows the contract owner to arbitrarily block or unblock addresses by modifying the botWallets mapping. This could be used maliciously to block legitimate users from transferring tokens or unblocking addresses that should remain blocked, potentially enabling insider trading or other forms of abuse.",

This could result in legitimate user balances being confiscated if they are erroneously added to the map, leading to loss of user funds. The function lacks transparency and accountability, making it prone to misuse.",
