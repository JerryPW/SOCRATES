        "vulnerability": "Gas limit vulnerability with unbounded iteration",
        "reason": "The multiSend function allows the owner to send tokens to multiple addresses in a single transaction. However, it does not impose any restrictions on the number of addresses in the _dests array. If the _dests array is too large, it can cause the transaction to exceed the block gas limit, leading to a failed transaction. This can be exploited by an attacker sending a very large _dests array to intentionally make the function fail and cause a denial of service.",

        "vulnerability": "Potential loss of tokens due to lack of reentrancy protection",
        "reason": "The tokensBack function transfers all tokens back to the owner's address without any reentrancy protection. If the sharesTokenAddress is a contract that has a fallback function or can trigger some external call to this contract, it may re-enter the tokensBack function before the tokenFree variable is set to 0. This could lead to unexpected behavior or loss of tokens if the contract logic is manipulated, allowing an attacker to drain tokens.",

        "vulnerability": "Unrestricted airdrop value change",
        "reason": "The changeAirdropValue function allows the owner to set any value for defValue without any checks or restrictions. This means the owner can set an extremely large value that does not correspond to the actual token balance of the contract, potentially leading to failed transactions or unintended behavior when distributing tokens. This could inadvertently allow the owner to mismanage the token distribution process, either intentionally or unintentionally.",
