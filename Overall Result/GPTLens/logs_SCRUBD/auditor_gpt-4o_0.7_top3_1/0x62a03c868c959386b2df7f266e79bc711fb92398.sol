        "reason": "The constructor of the contract sets the owner to the passed '_owner' address but immediately overrides it with 'msg.sender'. This means the initial owner address passed is disregarded and the contract deployer automatically becomes the owner. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the deployer is not the intended owner.",

        "reason": "The 'batchTransfer' function calls 'standardToken.transfer', which could potentially be a call to an untrusted contract. If the token contract is not well-implemented, it could call back into the 'batchTransfer' function, potentially leading to reentrancy issues or other unexpected behavior. Although this is a token interaction, it demonstrates a lack of checks around external calls.",

        "vulnerability": "Reset of Total User Transferred",
        "reason": "The 'setContractToken' function allows the owner to reset the 'standardToken' contract address and simultaneously resets 'totalUserTransfered' to zero. This could be exploited by the owner to manipulate the state of the contract, potentially misleading other users about the number of transfers already executed.",
