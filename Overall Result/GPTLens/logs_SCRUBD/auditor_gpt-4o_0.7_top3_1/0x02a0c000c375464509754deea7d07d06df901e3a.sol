        "reason": "The `renounceOwnership` function allows the current owner to set the owner to the zero address, effectively making the contract ownerless. This can be an issue if the contract requires ownership for certain privileged operations, as it can never be reassigned to a new owner, potentially locking out essential functionalities permanently.",

        "reason": "The `manualswap` function allows `_teamAddress` to swap all tokens held by the contract for ETH. This could be misused by the team to drain the contract's token balance at their discretion. The function lacks any control mechanism or transparency measures, which could lead to misuse by the authorized address.",

        "vulnerability": "Unrestricted transfer of contract ETH balance",
        "reason": "The `manualsend` function allows `_teamAddress` to transfer the entire ETH balance of the contract to specified addresses. This creates a risk where the team can withdraw all ETH from the contract at any time, potentially defrauding investors or users who expect ETH to remain within the contract for operational purposes.",
