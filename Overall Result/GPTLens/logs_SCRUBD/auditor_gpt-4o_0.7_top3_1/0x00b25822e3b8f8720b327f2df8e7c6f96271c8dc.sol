        "reason": "The function withdrawStuckETH allows the contract owner to withdraw all ETH in the contract to their address. However, this function uses a low-level call, which can lead to reentrancy attacks if the owner is a contract with a fallback function that re-enters the vulnerable contract. This could allow an attacker to drain the contract's ETH balance.",

        "vulnerability": "Lack of transfer event emission",
        "reason": "The transfer function calls the internal function ContractTransfer but does not directly emit a Transfer event. While ContractTransfer does handle token transfers and emits the Transfer event, failing to do so directly in the user-facing transfer function can lead to inconsistencies in event logs, especially if the internal logic changes or if the event is not emitted correctly from within the internal function.",

        "vulnerability": "Potential denial of service",
