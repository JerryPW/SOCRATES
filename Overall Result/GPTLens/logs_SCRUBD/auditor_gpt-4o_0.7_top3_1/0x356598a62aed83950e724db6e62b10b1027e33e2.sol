        "reason": "The withdraw function sends the entire balance of the contract to the owner using a low-level call. This can make the contract vulnerable to re-entrancy attacks, as the call may trigger other contracts that could call back into this contract before the balance is updated. This is particularly dangerous as it can lead to draining of funds or unintended behavior if a malicious contract is involved.",

        "vulnerability": "Improper fee handling",
        "reason": "In the lockTokens function, the fee addresses (fee1Address and fee2Address) are paid using low-level call without checking the success of these calls. This can potentially result in a loss of funds if the call fails, as the function will continue execution without reverting. Additionally, if fee1Address is not set (i.e., is address(0)), the calculated fees are not sent to any address, leading to a potential ether loss.",
