If the send operation fails (e.g., if the recipient is a contract with a fallback function that reverts), this failure is not handled, potentially leading to loss of funds or incorrect state. An attacker could exploit this by creating a contract that always fails upon receiving Ether, causing the payout function to behave unexpectedly or incorrectly.",

        "vulnerability": "Lack of access control on payout operation",
