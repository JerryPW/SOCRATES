        "vulnerability": "Reentrancy vulnerability in ether withdrawal",
        "reason": "The withdrawEth function, which allows the owner to withdraw the contract's entire ether balance, is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. Although it uses the nonReentrant modifier, which should protect against reentrancy, it is still advisable to use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern. This vulnerability could be exploited if the owner address is a contract that reverts or performs further actions in its fallback function, possibly leading to unexpected behavior or locking of funds.",

        "vulnerability": "Potential integer division issues and miscalculated payout",
        "reason": "The calculation of amountToPay involves division and multiplication which can lead to integer division errors and loss of precision, especially when dealing with small fractional amounts. This could result in the user receiving less ETH than expected. The contract should handle these calculations with care, potentially using a higher precision for calculations to avoid user dissatisfaction or potential exploitation by attackers who could find ways to manipulate the calculations to their benefit.",

        "vulnerability": "Addition of arbitrary tokens by owner",
        "reason": "The addToken function allows the owner to add arbitrary tokens to the contract, which could be exploited if the owner is compromised or malicious. This could result in users unknowingly staking tokens that are not legitimate or intended, leading to loss of funds. To mitigate this, there should be additional validation or a whitelist mechanism for tokens that can be added.",
