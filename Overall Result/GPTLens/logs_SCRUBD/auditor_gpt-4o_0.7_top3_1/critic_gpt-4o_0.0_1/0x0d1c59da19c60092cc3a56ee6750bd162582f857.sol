The function _swapTokensForEth does perform an external call to uniswapV2Router.swapExactTokensForETHSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens, but this call is to a well-known and trusted external contract (Uniswap V2 Router). The Uniswap V2 Router is not expected to call back into the contract, and thus the risk of reentrancy is minimal. Additionally, the function is private, reducing the risk of external manipulation. The severity and profitability are both low because the function does not expose any state that could be manipulated in a harmful way.",
