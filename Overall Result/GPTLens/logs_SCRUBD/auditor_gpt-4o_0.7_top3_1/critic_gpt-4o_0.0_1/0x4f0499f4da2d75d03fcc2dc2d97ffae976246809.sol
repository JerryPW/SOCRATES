This can indeed be exploited to change vesting periods to arbitrary values, potentially leading to unauthorized fund releases. The severity is high because it directly affects the vesting schedule, which is critical to the contract's functionality. The profitability is also high, as an attacker could manipulate the vesting periods to release funds prematurely.",
