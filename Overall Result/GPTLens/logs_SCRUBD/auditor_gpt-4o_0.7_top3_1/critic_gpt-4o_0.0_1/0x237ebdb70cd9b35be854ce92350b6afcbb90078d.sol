While 'call' can indeed be susceptible to reentrancy attacks, the current implementation does not modify any state variables within the loop, which limits the impact of such an attack. However, if the logic were to be extended to include state changes, the risk would increase. The severity is low in the current context, but could be higher if the function were modified.
