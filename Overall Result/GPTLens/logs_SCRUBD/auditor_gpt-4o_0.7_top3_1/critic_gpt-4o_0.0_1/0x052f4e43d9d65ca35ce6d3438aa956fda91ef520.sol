However, the concern about the external call to swapTokensForETH is valid, as it could potentially involve a callback that interacts with the contract again. The severity is moderate because the nonReentrant modifier should mitigate the risk, but the potential for a callback still exists.

This function swaps tokens and then uses BNB balance to distribute amounts to marketing and development wallets and add liquidity.

The concern about users unintentionally burning tokens is valid but is more of a user experience issue than a security vulnerability.
