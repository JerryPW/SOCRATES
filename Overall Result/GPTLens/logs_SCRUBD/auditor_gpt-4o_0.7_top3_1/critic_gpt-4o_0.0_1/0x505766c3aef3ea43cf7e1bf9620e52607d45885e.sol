However, the function uses 'send', which only forwards 2300 gas, making reentrancy less likely unless the recipient is a contract specifically designed to exploit this. The severity is moderate because the function does not use 'call', which would be more dangerous. The profitability is low to moderate, as an attacker would need to deploy a specific contract to exploit this, and the impact is limited by the gas stipend.",
