This design can lead to unexpected state changes, but it is not necessarily a vulnerability unless the creator's actions are malicious. The severity is moderate because it depends on the creator's intentions, and the profitability is low for external attackers as they cannot exploit this directly.",

However, the likelihood of an infinite loop is low unless there is a logical error in managing tax amounts.
