This is indeed a logic error that prevents the function from iterating over all investments, potentially leading to incomplete withdrawals. However, the claim that this could be exploited by attackers is misleading, as it is more of a design flaw than an exploitable vulnerability. The severity is moderate because it affects the functionality of the contract, but the profitability is low since it does not provide a direct financial gain to an attacker.",
