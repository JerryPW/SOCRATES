The use of var for type inference can lead to unexpected behavior, but in this context, it is unlikely to cause significant issues if the Acc mapping is properly defined. The lack of input validation for _unlockTime is a more significant concern, as it allows users to set arbitrary unlock times, which could be exploited for logic manipulation.
