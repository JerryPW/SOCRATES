This is a significant issue as it can result in an incorrect distribution of tokens, potentially depleting the contract's token balance. The severity is high because it directly affects the token distribution logic, and the profitability is moderate as it allows the seller to gain more tokens than they should.",

        "reason": "The function attempts to transfer tokens to the seller based on the difference between the total IOUs purchased and withdrawn.

This is a critical vulnerability as it can leave the contract without funds to compensate IOU holders, leading to potential financial loss for them.

If price_per_eth is set too high, users may not receive a fair amount of IOUs for their ether, leading to potential financial loss.
