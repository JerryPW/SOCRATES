The function does not check the return value of the transfer function, which is a common mistake in Solidity that can lead to incorrect assumptions about the success of the transfer.

However, the function is marked as private and uses a lock mechanism (lockTheSwap), which suggests some level of protection against reentrancy. The severity is moderate because reentrancy can lead to significant issues if not properly handled, but the existing lock mechanism reduces the risk.
