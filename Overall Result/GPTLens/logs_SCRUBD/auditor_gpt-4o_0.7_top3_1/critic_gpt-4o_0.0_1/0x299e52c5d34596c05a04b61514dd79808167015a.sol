The function transfers tokens before setting the isActive flag to false, which could be exploited if the DGX token's transfer function allows for reentrancy. However, the severity depends on the behavior of the DGX token contract. If the DGX token is a well-known and trusted token that does not allow reentrancy, the risk is minimal.
