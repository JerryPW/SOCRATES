This can indeed lead to confusion during audits or when reviewing logs. However, this issue does not affect the actual ownership transfer, which is correctly implemented. The severity is low because it does not impact the contract's functionality, and the profitability is also low as it does not provide any financial gain to an attacker.",

This could lead to issues if a mistake is made or if the user needs to change their ID.
