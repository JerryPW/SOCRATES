However, the claim that an attacker can exploit this by sending a large _dests array is incorrect because the function is restricted by the onlyOwner modifier, meaning only the contract owner can call it. Therefore, the severity is moderate as it can lead to failed transactions if the owner is not careful, but it is not exploitable by an external attacker, making the profitability low.",

However, it does not impose any restrictions on the number of addresses in the _dests array. If the _dests array is too large, it can cause the transaction to exceed the block gas limit, leading to a failed transaction. This can be exploited by an attacker sending a very large _dests array to intentionally make the function fail and cause a denial of service.",

If sharesTokenAddress is a contract with a fallback function, it could potentially re-enter the tokensBack function before the tokenFree variable is set to 0.

If the sharesTokenAddress is a contract that has a fallback function or can trigger some external call to this contract, it may re-enter the tokensBack function before the tokenFree variable is set to 0.
