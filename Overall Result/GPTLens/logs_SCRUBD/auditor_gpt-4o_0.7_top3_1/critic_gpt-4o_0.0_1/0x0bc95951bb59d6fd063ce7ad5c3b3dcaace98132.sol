This can indeed cause the transaction to revert if the sender has not set an allowance for the contract to spend their tokens. This is a significant issue as it prevents users from being refunded as intended, which can lead to user dissatisfaction and potential financial loss. The severity is moderate to high because it directly affects the refund process. The profitability is low because an external attacker cannot exploit this for financial gain.",

The successful function can indeed be called by anyone once the state is marked as Successful, allowing any user to transfer all remaining tokens and ETH balance to the creator. However, the function does include a time check (now > completedAt.add(14 days)), which means the transfer can only occur after the 14-day period has passed. The lack of access control is a valid concern, but the timing restriction mitigates the risk to some extent. The severity is moderate because it could lead to misuse if the timing condition is not properly enforced.
