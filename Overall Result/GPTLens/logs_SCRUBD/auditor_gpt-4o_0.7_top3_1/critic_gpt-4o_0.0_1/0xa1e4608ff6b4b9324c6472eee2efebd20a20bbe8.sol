However, the vulnerability is not as severe as it might seem because the `kittenContract.transfer()` function is typically a safe ERC20 transfer, which does not allow reentrancy. The severity is moderate because if `kittenContract` is not a standard ERC20, it could be exploited. The profitability is low to moderate, depending on the implementation of `kittenContract`.",

The contract makes an external call to `kittenContract.transfer()` before updating the state variables `participants[msg.sender]`, `kittensRemainingToDrop`, and `kittensDroppedToTheWorld`.
