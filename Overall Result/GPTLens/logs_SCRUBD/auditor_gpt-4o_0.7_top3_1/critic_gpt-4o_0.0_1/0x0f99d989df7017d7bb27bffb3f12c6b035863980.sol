If the specified address is compromised or maliciously set, it could lead to control of the contract being taken over by an unintended party. However, this is more of a design decision rather than a direct vulnerability, as it assumes the owner address is not secure. The severity is moderate because it depends on the security of the owner's address. The profitability is low for external attackers unless they can compromise the owner's address.",
