        "criticism": "The reasoning is partially correct. The function does involve arithmetic operations that could potentially lead to overflow or underflow, especially if `_totalAttempt` is very small. However, Solidity versions 0.8.0 and above have built-in overflow and underflow checks, which would automatically revert the transaction if such an event occurs. If the contract is using an older version of Solidity, this could be a valid concern. The severity is moderate because it could lead to incorrect payouts, but the profitability is low as it would not directly benefit an attacker.",
