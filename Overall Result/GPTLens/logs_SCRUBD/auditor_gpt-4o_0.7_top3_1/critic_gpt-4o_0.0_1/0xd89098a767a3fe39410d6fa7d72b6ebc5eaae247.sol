This could indeed lead to an unexpected release of tokens, which might not align with the beneficiaries' expectations. However, this is a design decision rather than a vulnerability, as the owner is explicitly given this power. The severity is moderate because it depends on the owner's intentions, and the profitability is low since an external attacker cannot exploit this.",

However, this is not inherently a vulnerability but rather a feature of the contract's design.
