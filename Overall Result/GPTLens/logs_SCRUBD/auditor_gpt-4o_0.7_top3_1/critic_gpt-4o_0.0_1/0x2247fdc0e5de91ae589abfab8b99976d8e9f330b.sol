However, the specific calculation in the deposit function is unlikely to cause such issues unless the multiplier is set to an extremely high value.

        "reason": "The calculation for payout uses multiplication and division, which in older Solidity versions (like 0.4.21) can lead to overflow/underflow issues if not carefully handled. This can cause incorrect calculations of payouts, potentially leading to loss of funds for participants.",
