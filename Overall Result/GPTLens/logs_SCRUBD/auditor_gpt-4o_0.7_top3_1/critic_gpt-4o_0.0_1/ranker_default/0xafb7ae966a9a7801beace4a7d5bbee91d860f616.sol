The function transfers tokens before updating the SellAmount state variable, which could be exploited if the token contract allows reentrancy through a malicious fallback function.

Not checking for a zero address can indeed lead to a loss of contract control if ownership is transferred to a zero address. This is a significant oversight as it can render the contract unusable.
