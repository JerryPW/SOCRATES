        "criticism": "The reasoning is correct. The withdraw function does not follow the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, which is a common best practice to prevent reentrancy attacks. By allowing external calls (feeCollector.call.value(fee)()) before updating the state (setting balances to zero), an attacker could repeatedly call withdraw and drain the contract's funds. The severity is high because it can lead to a complete loss of funds. The profitability is also high for an attacker who can exploit this vulnerability.",

The commission calculation (betAmount * 4 / 100) is straightforward and unlikely to cause significant discrepancies.
