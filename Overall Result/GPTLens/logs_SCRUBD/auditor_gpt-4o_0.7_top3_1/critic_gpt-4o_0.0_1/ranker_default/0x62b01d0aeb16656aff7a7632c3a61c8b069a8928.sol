The use of send() can be exploited if the receiver is a contract with a fallback function that reenters the contract. The severity is high because reentrancy can lead to significant financial loss by draining the contract's funds. The profitability is also high for an attacker who can exploit this vulnerability.",

While the use of uint128 reduces the risk of overflow/underflow, the concern is valid for Solidity version 0.4.25, which does not have built-in overflow checks.
