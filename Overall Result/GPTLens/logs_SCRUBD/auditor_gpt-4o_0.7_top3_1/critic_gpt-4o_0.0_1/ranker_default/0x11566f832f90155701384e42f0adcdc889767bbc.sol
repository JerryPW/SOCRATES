This is a design choice rather than a vulnerability, but it can lead to issues if done unintentionally. The severity is moderate because it results in a permanent loss of control, but it is not exploitable by an external attacker, so profitability is low.",

        "reason": "The renounceOwnership function allows the current owner to set the owner address to address(0), effectively removing any ownership control over the contract.
