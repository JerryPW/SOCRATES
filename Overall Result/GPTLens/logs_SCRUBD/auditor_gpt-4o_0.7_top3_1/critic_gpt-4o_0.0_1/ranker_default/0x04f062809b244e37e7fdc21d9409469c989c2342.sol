This is a significant vulnerability as it gives the admin excessive control over user funds, which could be abused. The severity is high because it undermines user trust and security.

If 'userLock[msg.sender]' can be set to zero by another function like 'unlockMe', it could indeed allow users to bypass the lock and withdraw tokens prematurely. However, the severity depends on how 'unlockMe' is implemented and whether it is accessible to users. If 'unlockMe' is restricted or properly controlled, the risk is mitigated.
