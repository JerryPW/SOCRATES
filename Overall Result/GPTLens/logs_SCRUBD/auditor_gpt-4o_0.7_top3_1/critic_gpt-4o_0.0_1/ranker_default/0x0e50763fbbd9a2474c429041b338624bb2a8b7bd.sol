This could indeed be exploited if tokens are mistakenly sent to the contract, allowing the owner to take possession of those tokens without restriction. However, this is a common pattern for owner-controlled contracts to recover tokens sent by mistake, and it is not inherently a vulnerability unless the owner is malicious.
