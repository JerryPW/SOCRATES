The use of send can fail if the recipient is a contract that requires more than 2300 gas, and since the function does not check the return value of send, it can lead to inconsistencies. However, the severity is moderate because it does not revert the transaction, which could lead to unexpected behavior. The profitability is low because an attacker cannot directly profit from this vulnerability.",

However, the use of send without checking its return value is a more significant issue, as it can lead to inconsistencies if the send fails.
