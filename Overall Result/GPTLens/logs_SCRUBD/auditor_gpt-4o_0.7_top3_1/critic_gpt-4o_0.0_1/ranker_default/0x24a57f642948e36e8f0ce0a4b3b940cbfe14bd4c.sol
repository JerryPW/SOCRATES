This is a known issue with 'send', and using 'transfer' or 'call' with proper checks is recommended. The severity is moderate because it can lead to funds being locked, but it does not directly lead to a loss of funds.

However, since the function uses a standard ERC20 transfer, which typically does not allow reentrancy, the risk is lower than stated.
