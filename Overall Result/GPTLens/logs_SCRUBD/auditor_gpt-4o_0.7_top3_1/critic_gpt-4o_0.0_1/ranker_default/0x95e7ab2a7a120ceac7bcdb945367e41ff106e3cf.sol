An attacker can exploit this by implementing a fallback function that calls `drain` again before the initial call completes, potentially draining the contract's balance. The severity is high because it can lead to a complete loss of funds. The profitability is also high for an attacker who can exploit this vulnerability.",

However, the vulnerability lies in the lack of access control or validation mechanisms to ensure that the address is secure and controlled by a trusted party. If an attacker can influence this address, they can potentially gain control over the contract's funds. The severity is moderate because it depends on the context in which the contract is deployed. The profitability is moderate as well, as it requires specific conditions to be met for exploitation.",
