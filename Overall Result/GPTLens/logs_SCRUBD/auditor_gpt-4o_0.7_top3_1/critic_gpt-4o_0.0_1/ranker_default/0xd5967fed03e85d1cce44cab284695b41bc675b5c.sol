This lack of validation can indeed lead to unintended behavior if malicious or incorrect addresses are provided. However, the claim that this can lead to reentrancy attacks is not directly supported by the code provided, as reentrancy typically involves external calls that allow re-entry into the same function, which is not evident here.
