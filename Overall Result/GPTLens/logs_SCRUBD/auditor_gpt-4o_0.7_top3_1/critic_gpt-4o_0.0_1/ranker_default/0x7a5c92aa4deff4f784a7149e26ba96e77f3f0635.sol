The function does not handle potential underflow/overflow conditions properly, which can lead to an infinite loop if 'end' is not greater than 'start'. Additionally, the use of 'send' is unsafe for the reasons mentioned earlier. However, the lack of array bounds checks is not explicitly mentioned in the reasoning, which is a critical oversight.
