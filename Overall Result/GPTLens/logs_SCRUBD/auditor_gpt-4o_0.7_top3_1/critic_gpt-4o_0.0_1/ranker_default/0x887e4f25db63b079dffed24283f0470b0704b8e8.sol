If a malicious contract is a recipient, it could re-enter the contract and manipulate the state or exhaust the gas limit. This is a classic reentrancy issue, which can be severe if exploited. The severity is high because it can lead to unexpected behavior and potential loss of funds.

The 'send' function only forwards 2300 gas, which is not enough for complex operations, and it does not revert on failure, which can indeed lead to ether being locked in the contract. This can leave the contract in an inconsistent state if the send fails and the subsequent logic assumes it succeeded. The severity is moderate because it can lead to loss of funds, but it is not easily exploitable by an attacker. The profitability is low because an attacker cannot directly profit from this vulnerability.",

This can indeed lead to a denial of service if the function is called with a large enough range. However, since this function is restricted to the owner, the risk of exploitation is limited to the owner misusing the function.
