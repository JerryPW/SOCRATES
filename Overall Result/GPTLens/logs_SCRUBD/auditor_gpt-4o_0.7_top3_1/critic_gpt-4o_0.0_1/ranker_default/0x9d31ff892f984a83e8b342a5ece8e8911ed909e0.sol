The send() function only forwards 2300 gas, which is insufficient for complex fallback functions, causing the transaction to revert if the recipient is a contract with such a fallback.

The use of send() with its limited gas stipend of 2300 gas effectively prevents reentrancy attacks, as it does not allow enough gas for a reentrant call to execute.
