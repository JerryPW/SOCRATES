If the interestRate is set too high, the multiplication could overflow, leading to an incorrect and potentially massive weiAmount being paid out. This is a serious vulnerability as it can be exploited to drain funds from the contract.

The send() method only forwards 2300 gas, which may not be sufficient for the recipient to execute further logic, potentially causing issues if the recipient contract requires more gas. Additionally, the lack of error handling for a failed send() call can lead to loss of funds or a halt in contract execution.
