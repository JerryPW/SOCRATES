This could disrupt the intended locking logic. However, the severity is somewhat mitigated by the requirement that `totalLockedBalance` must be zero, which is a significant constraint.

This allows any user to call this function, potentially reinitializing the locked balance if the requirement on `totalLockedBalance` being zero is somehow met by transferring out tokens.
