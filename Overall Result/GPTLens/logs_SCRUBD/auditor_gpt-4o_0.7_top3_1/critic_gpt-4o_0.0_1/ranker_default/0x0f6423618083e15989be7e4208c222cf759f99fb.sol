This allows the transfer to occur without verifying if the sender has granted sufficient allowance, potentially enabling unauthorized transfers. The severity is high because it directly impacts the security of token transfers, and the profitability is also high as an attacker could exploit this to transfer tokens without proper authorization.",

        "reason": "The function `transferFrom` does not enforce the allowance check before calling the `_transfer` function. This allows an attacker to transfer tokens on behalf of the sender without sufficient allowance, as the allowance is checked and updated only after the transfer occurs.",
