The send method only forwards 2300 gas, which may not be sufficient for the recipient contract's fallback function, potentially causing Ether to be locked. Additionally, the lack of error handling means that failures are silent, which can lead to funds being lost without the caller's knowledge.

This can lead to Ether being permanently locked in the contract if the recipient address is a contract that requires more than 2300 gas to execute its fallback function.
