The use of `msg.sender.send` can indeed lead to a reentrancy vulnerability if the caller is a contract with a fallback function that re-enters the `withdrawETHAndTokens` function. This can potentially allow repeated withdrawals before the balance is updated, which can drain the contract of its ETH and token balances. The severity is high because it can lead to a complete loss of funds. The profitability is also high because an attacker can exploit this to drain the contract's assets.",
