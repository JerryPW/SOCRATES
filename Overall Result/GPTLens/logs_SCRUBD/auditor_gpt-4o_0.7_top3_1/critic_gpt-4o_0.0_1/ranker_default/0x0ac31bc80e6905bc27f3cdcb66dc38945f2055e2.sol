        "reason": "The 'emergencyChangePrice' function allows the contract owner to change the price of minting without any restriction or validation. This could be exploited by the contract owner to set an unreasonably high or low price, potentially defrauding users or manipulating the minting process. To mitigate this, consider adding validation to ensure the new price is within a reasonable range.",

        "criticism": "The reasoning is correct in identifying the potential issue with using 'transfer' due to its fixed gas stipend of 2300 gas, which may not be sufficient for recipient contracts with complex fallback or receive functions. This can lead to failed transactions if the recipient contract requires more gas. The severity is moderate as it can cause legitimate withdrawals to fail, but it does not lead to a direct loss of funds. The profitability is low because an external attacker cannot exploit this for financial gain.",

        "reason": "The 'withdraw' function uses 'transfer', which sends a fixed amount of gas (2300 gas) to the recipient. This may not be enough if the recipient is a contract and has a fallback or receive function that requires more gas. Furthermore, if the recipient contract has a fallback function that consumes more than 2300 gas, the transfer will fail. To address this, consider using 'call' instead of 'transfer' to send Ether, allowing for dynamic gas forwarding.",

The '_safeMint' function is typically designed to be safe against reentrancy attacks, as it is a common function in ERC721 implementations that handles minting securely.
