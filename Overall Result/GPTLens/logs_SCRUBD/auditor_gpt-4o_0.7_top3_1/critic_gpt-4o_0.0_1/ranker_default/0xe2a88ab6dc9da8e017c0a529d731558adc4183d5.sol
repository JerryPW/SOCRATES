The 'drain' function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks because it allows the implementation address to withdraw the entire balance without using any safeguards like the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern or a reentrancy guard.

The severity is high because it can lead to a complete loss of funds. The profitability is also high for an attacker who can exploit this vulnerability.",
