The fallback to sending the balance to the owner if the initial send fails is also risky, as it could lead to unintended ether loss or theft if the owner is compromised.

While the use of send() does limit the gas forwarded, reducing the risk of reentrancy, the function's logic is complex and involves multiple send operations. If any recipient contract has a fallback function that reverts or calls back into this contract, it could potentially disrupt the intended flow.
