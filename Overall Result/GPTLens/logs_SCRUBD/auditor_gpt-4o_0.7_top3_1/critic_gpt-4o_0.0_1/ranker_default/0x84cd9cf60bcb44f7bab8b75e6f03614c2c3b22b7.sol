This could lead to the contract being destroyed and all funds being sent to the `TECH` address. The severity is high because it results in the complete loss of the contract and its funds.

        "criticism": "The reasoning correctly identifies the potential for a reentrancy attack due to the use of `.send()`, which only forwards 2300 gas, potentially allowing a fallback function to execute. However, the use of `.send()` inherently limits the risk of reentrancy because it does not provide enough gas for a reentrant call to succeed in most cases. The severity is moderate because the function does not update `currentReceiverIndex` before sending, which could be exploited if the gas limit changes or if the fallback function is optimized. The profitability is moderate as well, as a successful reentrancy attack could allow multiple withdrawals.",

        "reason": "The use of `.send()` to transfer ether does not protect against reentrancy attacks.

This could lead to multiple withdrawals by the same depositor.",

This is a known issue with the 2300 gas stipend. The severity is moderate because it can prevent deposits from being processed correctly, but it does not lead to a loss of funds.
