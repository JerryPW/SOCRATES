The function does not implement any reentrancy guard, which could allow an attacker to exploit this by calling back into the contract. The severity is moderate because it depends on the implementation of the _spender contract, but the potential for unexpected behavior and fund loss is significant. The profitability is moderate as well, as an attacker could potentially exploit this to drain funds if the contract holds significant value.",
