The function does allow the transfer of excess tokens to a marketing address, but it does not explicitly check the caller's address, which is a concern. However, the function name suggests it is intended for the owner, and if the 'onlyOwner' modifier is applied elsewhere in the contract, this would mitigate the risk. The severity is moderate because it depends on the owner's intentions, and the profitability is low for external attackers.",
