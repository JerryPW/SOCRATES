        "criticism": "The reasoning is partially correct. While overloaded functions in Solidity can indeed lead to selector collisions, this is not inherently a vulnerability unless the function signatures are such that they cause a collision. Solidity uses the first four bytes of the keccak256 hash of the function signature to determine the function selector. If the signatures are different enough, they will not collide. The severity is low because this is more of a design issue than a security vulnerability. The profitability is also low because an attacker cannot directly exploit this for financial gain unless a collision actually occurs.",
