Additionally, the lack of a success check for the send operation can indeed leave the contract in an inconsistent state if the send fails. This is a well-known issue with using send, and the severity is moderate because it can lead to loss of funds or unexpected behavior.

Although send is generally considered safer than call in terms of reentrancy, the fallback function's logic allows for state updates after external calls, which is a classic setup for reentrancy vulnerabilities.
