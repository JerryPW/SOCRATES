The use of 'send' to transfer Ether before updating state variables 'timestamp' and 'balances' can indeed allow an attacker to re-enter the contract and drain funds. The severity is high because reentrancy can lead to significant financial loss. The profitability is also high as an attacker can exploit this to drain the contract's funds.",

While block timestamps can be manipulated by miners, the impact on the 'getout' calculation is limited by the fact that miners can only adjust timestamps within a small range.
