However, the function is marked as nonReentrant, which mitigates reentrancy within the same contract. The risk is contingent on the IWETH contract being vulnerable, which is an external factor. The severity is moderate because it depends on the external contract's security, and the profitability is low unless the external contract is indeed vulnerable.",
