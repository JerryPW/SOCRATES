The success variable is set but immediately reset to false, which means the actual result of the call is disregarded. This could indeed result in a loss of funds if the call fails, as the contract would not revert and the owner wouldn't be notified of the failed transfer. The severity is moderate because it could lead to unnoticed failed transactions, but it does not directly allow for exploitation.
