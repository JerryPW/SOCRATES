        "reason": "Each time the fallback function is executed, the entire 'amountRaised' is sent to the beneficiary. This means all contributions are immediately forwarded, and if a transaction fails, the funds could be lost. Also, resetting 'amountRaised' to 0 after sending funds is problematic, as it does not ensure the send operation was successful.",
