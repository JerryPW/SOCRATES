        "reason": "The `renounceOwnership` function allows the current owner to renounce ownership of the contract, setting the owner address to zero. Once ownership is renounced, there is no way to recover the owner privileges or assign a new owner, which can be problematic if future administrative actions are required. This can lead to issues in managing the contract, especially if critical functions are restricted to the owner.",

        "reason": "The `manualSwap` function is restricted to being called by `_feeAddrWallet1`. However, there is no detailed access control mechanism beyond this address check. If `_feeAddrWallet1` is compromised, an attacker could exploit this function to swap all tokens held by the contract for ETH, potentially draining the contract's assets.",
