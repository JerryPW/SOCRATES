        "reason": "The renounceOwnership function allows the current owner to set the owner address to zero, effectively removing any control over the contract. This could be an issue if the owner needs to regain control or make changes in the future. Once ownership is renounced, no further owner-only functions can be executed.",

        "reason": "The setBots function allows the owner to mark any address as a bot, which can prevent them from transacting. This centralized control can be abused by the owner to block legitimate users from using the token, especially if the owner account is compromised.",
