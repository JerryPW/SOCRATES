        "reason": "The send() function only forwards 2,300 gas, which may not be sufficient for the recipient's fallback function to execute successfully. This could lead to situations where the transfer fails, but the contract does not handle this failure, leaving it in an inconsistent state. Using call.value()() is generally recommended for transferring Ether after ensuring it has enough gas and handling the return value properly to address potential issues.",
