        "vulnerability": "Reentrancy vulnerability",
        "reason": "The function uses `msg.sender.send`, which sends ETH to the caller. This can be exploited if the caller is a contract with a fallback function that re-enters the `withdrawETHAndTokens` function, potentially allowing repeated withdrawals before the balance is updated. This can drain the contract of its ETH and token balances.",

        "vulnerability": "Lack of access control",
        "reason": "The function allows the contract owner to withdraw all ETH and tokens from the contract, which is a centralized control risk. If the owner account is compromised, the attacker can drain the contract of all its assets. This centralization risk is aggravated by the fact that the owner can be changed via the `changeOwner` function.",
