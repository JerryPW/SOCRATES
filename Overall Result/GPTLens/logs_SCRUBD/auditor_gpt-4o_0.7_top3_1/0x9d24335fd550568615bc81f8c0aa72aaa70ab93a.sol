        "vulnerability": "Unsafe ether transfer with send",
        "reason": "The function uses 'send' to transfer ether to the owner, which only forwards 2300 gas and does not throw an error if the transfer fails. This could lead to ether being stuck in the contract if the owner's address is unable to accept the transfer for any reason (e.g., if it is a contract with a fallback function that requires more than 2300 gas). Using 'transfer' or 'call' with proper error handling would be safer.",

        "vulnerability": "Reentrancy vulnerability",
        "reason": "The 'send' function is used to transfer ether to users, which can lead to reentrancy attacks if any of the recipients are contracts with fallback functions that call back into the contract. This could allow attackers to manipulate the state of the contract between operations, potentially leading to financial loss. Consider using 'transfer' or 'call' with proper reentrancy guards (e.g., the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern).",

        "vulnerability": "Integer underflow in loop",
        "reason": "The decrement operation 'end-=1' in the while loop could result in an integer underflow if 'end' is zero, which would cause the loop to continue indefinitely. This could lead to a denial of service if not properly handled. Input validation should be added to ensure 'end' is always greater than 'start' and non-zero before entering the loop.",
