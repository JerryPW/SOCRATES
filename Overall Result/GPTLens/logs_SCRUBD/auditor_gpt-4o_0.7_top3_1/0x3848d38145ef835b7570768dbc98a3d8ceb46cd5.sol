        "reason": "In the `swapBack` function, the contract attempts to distribute BNB to various addresses using `call`. If any of these calls fail (e.g., due to high gas costs or a contract rejecting the call), the function will not revert the transaction as failures are caught silently. This could lead to situations where funds are not properly distributed, potentially causing a denial of service if the function is repeatedly called.",
