This oversight can lead to the owner accidentally or maliciously transferring ownership to a zero address, resulting in the loss of contract control and making it impossible for anyone to call functions with the onlyOwner modifier.",

        "vulnerability": "Lack of return value check for ERC20 transfer",
        "reason": "The function calls token.transfer without checking its return value. In older ERC20 implementations, transfer can return false, indicating failure. Without checking the return value, the contract assumes the transfer always succeeds, which can lead to discrepancies in the token accounting and potential loss of tokens.",

        "vulnerability": "Potential reentrancy attack",
        "reason": "The function allows sending tokens to the _buyer before updating the SellAmount state variable. If the token contract calls back into the buyTokens function (via a malicious fallback in the token contract), it could re-enter and manipulate the state or cause unintended behavior. This is a classic reentrancy vulnerability.",
