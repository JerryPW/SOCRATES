This predictability allows a miner to game the system and become the winner unfairly.",

        "reason": "The function `manipulateSecret` attempts to transfer an amount of 0 to the sender, which makes the function ineffective in terms of transferring any Ether.

        "reason": "The function `claimPrize` allows the current `winner` to transfer the entire balance of the contract to their address. If the `unlockSecret` function is exploited to designate an attacker as the `winner`, this function can be used to drain all funds from the contract. Additionally, there is no check to ensure that the `winner` is legitimate, further enabling exploitation through the manipulation of the `unlockSecret` mechanism.",
