        "reason": "The `removeERC20` function allows any caller to transfer any ERC20 tokens held by the contract to the `mkt` address without any access control checks. This means that any user can deplete the contract of its ERC20 token holdings, which could be exploited if the contract receives tokens by mistake or during normal operations.",

        "vulnerability": "Potential approval race condition",
        "reason": "The `startTrade` function approves the Uniswap router to spend an unlimited amount of WETH tokens. This can lead to a race condition where if the allowance is not promptly used, the approved amount may be exploited by calling another function that uses the same allowance. Additionally, transferring WETH from the `admin` address without ensuring it has enough balance could potentially revert if the balance is insufficient.",

This could result in significantly less tokens being received than expected if the price changes unfavorably during the transaction. This lack of slippage control can be exploited by front-running the transaction, causing the swap to execute at an unfavorable rate.",
