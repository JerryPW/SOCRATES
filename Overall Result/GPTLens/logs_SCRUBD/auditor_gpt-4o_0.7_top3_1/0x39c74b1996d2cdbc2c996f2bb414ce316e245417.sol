        "vulnerability": "Potential reentrancy in token transfer",
        "reason": "Even though this function is protected by an owner check, there is still a risk of reentrancy if the token's transfer function is vulnerable. Although not directly exploitable from this contract alone, using tokens with faulty transfer implementations could allow an attacker to exploit this contract through reentrancy. The function should use checks-effects-interactions pattern to mitigate such risks.",
