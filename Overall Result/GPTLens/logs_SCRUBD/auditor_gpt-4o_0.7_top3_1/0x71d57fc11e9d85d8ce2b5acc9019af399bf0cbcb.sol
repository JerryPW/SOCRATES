        "reason": "The `lock` function allows the owner to set `end_time` to any arbitrary value provided as `lockTime`, including a past timestamp. This means the owner can potentially set an `end_time` that makes `lockOver()` return true immediately or very soon after locking the tokens, defeating the purpose of a lock.",

        "vulnerability": "Owner-only release",
        "reason": "The `release` function can only be called by the owner due to the `onlyOwner` modifier. This centralizes control and presents a risk if the owner is compromised or acts maliciously. A more secure design would allow the beneficiary to release tokens once the lock period is over, ensuring the owner cannot withhold the release.",

        "vulnerability": "Potentially incorrect lock behavior",
        "reason": "The `lockOver` function checks if the current time is greater than `end_time`, but `end_time` is set directly from the `lockTime` parameter in the `lock` function. This setup can lead to logical errors where the lock might not function as intended if `lockTime` is not properly calculated or validated, and may overlap with the `lock` vulnerability that allows setting arbitrary `end_time`.",
