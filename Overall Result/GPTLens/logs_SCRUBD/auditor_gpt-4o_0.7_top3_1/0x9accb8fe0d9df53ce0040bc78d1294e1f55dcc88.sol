This lack of transparency can lead to issues in tracking changes in ownership, which is crucial for audits and ensuring accountability in decentralized systems.",

        "vulnerability": "Potential Integer Division Error",
        "reason": "The buy function calculates the amount of tokens to be bought by dividing the msg.value by buyPrice. If buyPrice is set to zero, this will cause a division by zero error. Furthermore, integer division can lead to loss of precision, potentially causing the buyer to receive fewer tokens than expected. These issues can be exploited by setting inappropriate prices to disrupt token purchases.",

        "vulnerability": "Denial of Service via Reentrancy",
        "reason": "The sell function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks since it sends Ether to the seller before updating the state. An attacker could exploit this by recursively calling sell, draining the contract's Ether balance by repeatedly selling tokens. This is because the state update occurs after the external call, allowing the attacker to execute code before the balance is adjusted.",
