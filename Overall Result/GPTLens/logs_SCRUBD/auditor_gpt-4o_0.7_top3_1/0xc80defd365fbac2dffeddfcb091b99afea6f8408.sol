        "reason": "Similar to 'withdrawTokens', the 'withdrawEther' function lacks access control, allowing any user to call it and transfer the contract's balance in ether to the owner's address.

        "reason": "The 'getTokens' function makes multiple external calls using 'call', which is a low-level function that forwards all available gas.
