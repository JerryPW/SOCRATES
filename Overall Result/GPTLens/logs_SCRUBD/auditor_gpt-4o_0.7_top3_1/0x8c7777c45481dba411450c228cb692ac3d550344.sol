        "vulnerability": "Reentrancy",
        "reason": "The CashOut function is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack.

This can result in the attacker withdrawing funds multiple times, exceeding their balance limit.",

        "vulnerability": "Improper Deposit Condition",
        "reason": "The Deposit function uses a greater than comparison (msg.value > MinDeposit) instead of greater than or equal to (msg.value >= MinDeposit). This means deposits equal to the MinDeposit are not accepted, potentially preventing legitimate deposits and causing user frustration or loss of funds if they expect a deposit of exactly 1 ether to succeed.",

        "reason": "The constructor allows setting the Log contract address without any restriction or validation.
