However, it does not use any safeguards against reentrancy attacks, such as the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern or a reentrancy guard. An attacker who gains control over the implementation address could exploit this by using a fallback function to repeatedly call 'drain', extracting all funds from the contract.",

        "reason": "The 'forward' function allows the implementation address to make arbitrary calls to any address with provided data and value.

An attacker controlling the implementation could redirect funds or perform unauthorized operations.",
