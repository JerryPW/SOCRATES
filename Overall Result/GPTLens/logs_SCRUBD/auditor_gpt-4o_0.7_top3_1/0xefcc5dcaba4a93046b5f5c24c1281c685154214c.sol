        "vulnerability": "Use of send() for Ether transfer",
        "reason": "The use of the `send` function for transferring Ether is risky because it only forwards 2300 gas, which is not enough to perform complex operations in the receiving contract. If the transaction fails, the Ether would remain stuck in the contract. A better alternative is to use `call` with a fallback to check for success, or even `transfer` if the gas limit issue is known and acceptable.",

        "vulnerability": "Reentrancy vulnerability",
        "reason": "The `withdrawAllEther` function allows owners to withdraw all Ether from the contract. However, it uses `send` without ensuring that state changes are made before the transfer, making it susceptible to reentrancy attacks. An attacker could exploit this to deplete the contract's funds by repeatedly calling `withdrawAllEther` before the contract's balance is updated.",

        "vulnerability": "Incorrect use of vestedTokens mapping",
        "reason": "The `claimTokens` function modifies the `vestedTokens` mapping only for the input address `_addr`, but sends tokens to `msg.sender`. This could allow a malicious user to claim tokens on behalf of others, potentially exploiting the function to transfer tokens they do not own. The function should ensure consistency between the address whose tokens are being claimed and the recipient.",
