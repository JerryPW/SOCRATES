        "reason": "The renounceOwnership function allows the owner to set the owner address to the zero address, effectively locking out any future ownership actions. This could be exploited if called by mistake or maliciously, rendering the contract effectively ownerless and preventing any administrative functions from being carried out.",

        "reason": "The COINDay function allows the owner to set the buyliqFee and buymktFee to 0 without any limitation or constraints. If misused, this could lead to a situation where fees are entirely waived for certain transactions, potentially allowing for fee-free trading for certain parties and causing financial loss to the contract or other participants.",
