        "vulnerability": "Reentrancy vulnerability",
        "reason": "The approveAndCall function allows a contract to be called after the approval. This can enable a reentrancy attack if the called contract calls back into approveAndCall before the transaction is completed. This is because the state changes (approval) happen before the external call, which is a dangerous pattern.",

        "vulnerability": "Unsafe use of send",
        "reason": "The use of send function is unsafe because it only forwards 2300 gas, which may not be enough for the recipient to process, and it does not check for the success of the transfer. This can lead to loss of funds if the transfer fails. It is better to use transfer or call with proper error handling.",

        "reason": "The selfdestructs function allows the contract owner to destroy the contract at any time, which can result in a permanent loss of funds and functionality for all users relying on this contract. This can be abused by a malicious owner or if the owner's account is compromised.",
