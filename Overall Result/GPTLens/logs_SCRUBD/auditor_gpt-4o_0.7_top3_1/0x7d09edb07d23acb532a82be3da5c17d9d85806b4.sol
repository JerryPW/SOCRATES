Since blockhash is predictable for recent blocks and msg.sender is known, an attacker can predict the outcome of the randomness, allowing them to exploit the function for guaranteed wins by manipulating the difficulty to their advantage.",

        "reason": "The function uses a low-level call to send Ether to the whale address without checking the return value. This can lead to a loss of funds if the call fails (e.g., if the target contract reverts), as the totalDonated value still increments without ensuring the transfer was successful.",
