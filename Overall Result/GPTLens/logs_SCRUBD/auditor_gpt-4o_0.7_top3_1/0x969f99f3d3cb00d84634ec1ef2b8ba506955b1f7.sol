        "reason": "Similar to the deposit function, the release function calls token.transfer without checking its return value.

        "vulnerability": "Lack of balance check",
        "reason": "The release function does not check if the contract has enough token balance to perform the transfer. An attacker could exploit this by authorizing themselves and calling release with an amount greater than the contract's balance, causing the transfer to fail silently (since the return value is unchecked) but updating the contract state as if the transfer was successful, leading to incorrect balances in the contract.",
