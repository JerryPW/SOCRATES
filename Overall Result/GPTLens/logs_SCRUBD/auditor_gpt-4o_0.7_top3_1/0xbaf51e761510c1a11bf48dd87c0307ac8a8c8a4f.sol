        "reason": "The CashOut function uses msg.sender.call.value(_am)() to send Ether, which allows the called contract to recursively call back into the CashOut function before the balance is updated, leading to potential reentrancy attacks. An attacker can exploit this by repeatedly withdrawing funds before the balance is updated, draining the contract's Ether.",

        "reason": "The Deposit function only allows deposits that are strictly greater than the MinDeposit (1 ether), which means deposits equal to 1 ether are rejected. This can cause user confusion or funds being locked if a user tries to deposit exactly 1 ether.",
