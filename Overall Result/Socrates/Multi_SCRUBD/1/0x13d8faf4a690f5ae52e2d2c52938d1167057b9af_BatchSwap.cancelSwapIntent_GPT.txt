          Reason: The modifier 'nonReentrant' uses the lock operation with flag assignments. The line 'require(_status != _ENTERED, "ReentrancyGuard: reentrant call");'
          checks for reentry, ensuring single entry (lock), and '_status = _NOT_ENTERED;' resets the status (unlock). This matches rule 2 where both lock and unlock
          operations are required.
