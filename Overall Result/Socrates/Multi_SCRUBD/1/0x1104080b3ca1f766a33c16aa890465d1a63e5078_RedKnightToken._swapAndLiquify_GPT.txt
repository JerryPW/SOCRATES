    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _swapAndLiquify.
    Check direct function security
        - function RedKnightToken._swapAndLiquify() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any checks or assertions based on msg.sender.
        - function RedKnightToken._swapAndLiquify() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not meet any of the specified structures for two-state variable requirements, since it does not contain the 'require' statement or
          variable state modification that matches any of the predefined structures.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

                    There are no modifiers should be examined in function transferFrom.
                    Check direct function security
                        - function RedKnightToken.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                          Reason: The function `transferFrom` does not contain any of the specified structures that involve checking `msg.sender` against an owner or
                          similar role. It performs token transfer logic using internal functions and checks allowances.
                        - function RedKnightToken.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                          Reason: The given function does not contain any of the required structures 1, 2, 3, or 4. There is no require statement or if statement checking
                          a condition that matches any of the given patterns.

    Direct external call: ['address(marketingWallet).transfer(amountETHMarketing)', 'address(devWallet).transfer(amountETHDev)',
    'address(buyBackWallet).transfer(amountETHBuyBack)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - address(marketingWallet).transfer(amountETHMarketing) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external
        call contains the '.transfer(' keyword, which matches the first characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - address(devWallet).transfer(amountETHDev) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains
        the '.transfer(' keyword, which matches the first characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - address(buyBackWallet).transfer(amountETHBuyBack) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        contains the '.transfer(' keyword, which matches the first characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.

    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _swapTokensForETH.
    Check direct function security
        - function RedKnightToken._swapTokensForETH(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures which involve checking msg.sender against ownership or leadership roles.
        - function RedKnightToken._swapTokensForETH(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code doesn't use any 'require' or 'if' statements for checking a condition before changing a variable's value, nor does it modify a boolean
          variable. The code is mainly executing a function swap for tokens and doesn't match any of the specified patterns.
