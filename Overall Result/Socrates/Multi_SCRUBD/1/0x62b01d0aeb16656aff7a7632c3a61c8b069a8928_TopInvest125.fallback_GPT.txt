Function Security Analysis for TopInvest125.fallback()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
    Check direct function security
        - function TopInvest125.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not include any require, if, or assert statements that directly compare msg.sender with an owner, address, leader, or CEO as specified in
          the criteria.
        - function TopInvest125.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code provided does not match any of the specified structures. There is no use of 'require(xxx == True)' or 'require(xxx == False)' with subsequent
          modification of the same 'xxx' variable. Also, there is no usage of '!xxx' or 'if(!xxx) throw' with subsequent true or false assignment.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['PROMO.send(promo)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - PROMO.send(promo) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the '.send(' keyword,
        which meets the second characteristic for consideration.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: TopInvest125.pay()
Function Security Analysis for TopInvest125.pay()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function pay.
    Check direct function security
        - function TopInvest125.pay() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The provided code does not contain a direct check involving the sender's address to match any of the specified conditions or characteristics such as
          require, if, or assert checks involving msg.sender and comparison with an owner's address.
        - function TopInvest125.pay() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function 'pay' does not contain any of the specified structures as it does not have any 'require' statements or if conditions that throw in the way
          defined. It also does not fulfill the variable manipulation patterns described in the structures to check for.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['fallback']
        Function Security Analysis for TopInvest125.fallback()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
            Check direct function security
                - function TopInvest125.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code uses 'require' statements but none are checking whether msg.sender is equal to any specified owner or manager role such as xxxOwner,
                  xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO. It checks different conditions like gas and value constraints which don't match criteria 1-4.
                - function TopInvest125.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code does not contain the specified structures with 'require' and assignment to the same variable in the required sequence. The
                  code does contain 'require' statements, but they do not satisfy the specific patterns provided as they involve different conditions and do not have
                  subsequent assignments to the same variable that the require checks on.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['dep.depositor.send(dep.expect)', 'dep.depositor.send(money)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - dep.depositor.send(dep.expect) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains '.send('
        keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - dep.depositor.send(money) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains '.send('
