Function Security Analysis for COPIUM._transfer(address,address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _transfer.
    Check direct function security
        - function COPIUM._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not include any condition that explicitly checks if 'msg.sender' matches 'xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO' to grant permission or
          access rights within the function.
        - function COPIUM._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not fulfill any of the specified structures or conditions required to return 'Yes'. It does not use the require statement to toggle a
          boolean variable nor an if condition to throw along with changing a boolean variable from false to true.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transferFrom', 'transfer']
        Function Security Analysis for COPIUM.transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transferFrom.
            Check direct function security
                - function COPIUM.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not include any condition that checks msg.sender against xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO. It only involves a transfer and approval
                  operation without access control using msg.sender.
                - function COPIUM.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code provided does not contain any of the given structures. It does not include require statements or if conditions that match any of the
                  specified patterns.

Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: COPIUM.swapAndLiquify()
Function Security Analysis for COPIUM.swapAndLiquify()
    The modifier of function swapAndLiquify are ['lockTheSwap']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier lockTheSwap is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The code in the modifier 'lockTheSwap' explicitly sets a flag 'inSwapAndLiquify' to true at the beginning and resets it to false at the end, which is a
          common pattern for using lock operations to ensure the function enters only once. Both 'lock' and 'unlock' operations are present in the structure, so it
          satisfies Condition 2.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
