Function Security Analysis for DividendDistributor.distributeDividend(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function distributeDividend.
    Check direct function security
        - function DividendDistributor.distributeDividend(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any checks where msg.sender is compared to an owner, address, or role like Leader or CEO.
        - function DividendDistributor.distributeDividend(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not match any of the specified patterns. Specifically, there are no 'require' or 'if(!xxx) throw' statements changing a boolean
          variable as required by the given patterns.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['setShare', 'process', 'claimDividend']
        Function Security Analysis for DividendDistributor.setShare(address,uint256)
            The modifier of function setShare are ['onlyToken']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyToken is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The code in the modifier enforces that only a specific address ('_token') can execute the function. It includes the statement
                  'require(msg.sender == _token);', which matches the structure of ensuring only a specific address can call the function (Rule 1). No structural
                  omissions in this assessment as it directly aligns with Rule 1 criteria.
        Function Security Analysis for DividendDistributor.process(uint256)
            The modifier of function process are ['onlyToken']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyToken is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The code in the modifier enforces that only a specific address (_token) can execute the function by checking if 'msg.sender == _token'. This
                  matches rule 1 as it restricts function execution to a specific address.
        Function Security Analysis for DividendDistributor.claimDividend(address)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function claimDividend.
            Check direct function security
                - function DividendDistributor.claimDividend(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The given code does not contain any of the specified structures that involve checking sender's address against an owner or leader address.
                - function DividendDistributor.claimDividend(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures. It does not have require statements or if statements that throw, nor does it have
                  variable assignments following those require statements.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['address(shareholder).call{gas:3000,value:amount}()']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - address(shareholder).call{gas:3000,value:amount}() is subjected to gas limits 3000. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem.
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
