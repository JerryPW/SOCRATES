        - function Crowdsale.buyTokens(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not have any 'require' or 'if' statements involving a variable check followed by an assignment to the same variable, as described in the
          given structures.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['msg.sender.transfer(_diff)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - msg.sender.transfer(_diff) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: This call contains the '.transfer('
        keyword, indicating a transfer of ETH or other native blockchain currency.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: Crowdsale._processPurchase(address,uint256)
Function Security Analysis for Crowdsale._processPurchase(address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _processPurchase.
    Check direct function security
        - function Crowdsale._processPurchase(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The given function `_processPurchase` does not contain any conditions or statements that involve checking `msg.sender` against an owner or leader
          address. It simply calls another function to deliver tokens, so none of the specified structures are present.
        - function Crowdsale._processPurchase(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided function does not have any require statements or if conditions that match the specified structures.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['buyTokens', 'manualSale', 'fallback']
        Function Security Analysis for Crowdsale.buyTokens(address)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function buyTokens.
            Check direct function security
                - function Crowdsale.buyTokens(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures that check the sender's address.
                - function Crowdsale.buyTokens(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The function does not contain the specific structure of 'require' or 'if...throw' statements that alter the same boolean variable in the
                  specified manner. It mainly handles numerical calculations and state updates without these control statements.

Start analyze function: Crowdsale._deliverTokens(address,uint256)
Function Security Analysis for Crowdsale._deliverTokens(address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _deliverTokens.
    Check direct function security
        - function Crowdsale._deliverTokens(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not include any msg.sender checks for owner or special address conditions, so none of the four defined structures are present.
        - function Crowdsale._deliverTokens(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code provided does not contain any 'require', 'if', or assignment statements for boolean variables, hence it does not satisfy any of the given
          patterns.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['buyTokens', 'manualSale', 'fallback', '_processPurchase']
        Function Security Analysis for Crowdsale.buyTokens(address)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function buyTokens.
            Check direct function security
                - function Crowdsale.buyTokens(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures that check the msg.sender against an owner, address, leader, or CEO as per the
                  criteria.
                - function Crowdsale.buyTokens(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code provided does not contain any of the specified structures, such as 'require(xxx == True); xxx = False;', 'require(xxx == False); xxx =
                  True;', 'require(!xxx); xxx = True;', or 'if(!xxx) throw; xxx = true;'. These involve specific conditional checks followed by assignments, which do not
                  exist in the function.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['token.safeOwnerTransfer(_beneficiary,_tokenAmount)']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - token.safeOwnerTransfer(_beneficiary,_tokenAmount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['token.safeOwnerTransfer(_beneficiary,_tokenAmount)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            Yes 1. The provided function is named 'constructor', which explicitly indicates it's a constructor in the context of Solidity smart contracts. 2. The function
            sets the state variable 'token' using an argument '_token', meaning it does not use a hardcoded value for 'token'.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
