Function Security Analysis for SAFX._transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _transferFrom.
    Check direct function security
        - function SAFX._transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code contains `require(tradingLive || sender == owner, ...)`, but it checks sender against the local variable 'owner' and not explicitly against a
          global or static contract owner/leader/CEO pattern, which does not qualify under the specified structures.
        - function SAFX._transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code contains the statement 'require(tradingLive || sender == owner, "Trading not live");', which uses a require statement to enforce a condition.
          However, this does not exactly match any of the specified patterns. In this case, there is no assignment to a boolean variable after require as needed by the
          patterns.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transferFrom', 'transfer']
        Function Security Analysis for SAFX.transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transferFrom.
            Check direct function security
                - function SAFX.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any conditional checks or assertions involving `msg.sender` being compared to an owner or specific address role
                  like Leader, CEO etc.
                - function SAFX.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures with 'require' or 'if(!xxx) throw' followed by setting a boolean variable to
                  True/False. It only checks and modifies an allowance variable, which is not a boolean.

Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: SAFX._sellTaxedTokens()
Function Security Analysis for SAFX._sellTaxedTokens()
    The modifier of function _sellTaxedTokens are ['swapping']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier swapping is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: Rule 2 is satisfied because the code uses a lock operation to ensure the function enters only once. It sets '_swapping' to true at the start and resets
          it to false afterward, matching both lock and unlock operations.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
