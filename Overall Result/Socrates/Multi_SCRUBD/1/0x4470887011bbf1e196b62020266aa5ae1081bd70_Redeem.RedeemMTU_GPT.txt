Function Security Analysis for Redeem.RedeemMTU(bool)
    The modifier of function RedeemMTU are ['paused']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier paused has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier 'paused' checks for a condition related to a flag 'Paused' but does not restrict access based on specific addresses/owner nor does it
          involve a lock mechanism as described in the rules.
    Check direct function security
        - function Redeem.RedeemMTU(bool) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The given code does not include any of the characteristic patterns related to the existence of access control checks on msg.sender as specified in the
          instructions.
        - function Redeem.RedeemMTU(bool) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not match any of the specified structures that involve logical reassignments of a boolean variable conditioned by require or if
          statements.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['tokenFunction.transfer(msg.sender,AppliedUnits)', 'msg.sender.transfer(withdrawVal)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - tokenFunction.transfer(msg.sender,AppliedUnits) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - msg.sender.transfer(withdrawVal) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains
        '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - tokenFunction.transfer(msg.sender,AppliedUnits) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['tokenFunction.transfer(msg.sender,AppliedUnits)']
    Analyze External Address
        The variable 'tokenFunction' in external call 'tokenFunction.transfer(msg.sender,AppliedUnits)' has no state variable assigned in Redeem.RedeemMTU(bool).
        Therefore we check whether it has been hardcoded in the function.
            No The variable 'tokenFunction' is not hardcoded. It is dynamically assigned using the 'getAddress' function and 'token' constructor, which retrieves an
            address based on a specific string-key and then uses it to create a token instance. This indicates that 'tokenFunction' can represent different token
            contracts depending on conditions outside of this code snippet.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
