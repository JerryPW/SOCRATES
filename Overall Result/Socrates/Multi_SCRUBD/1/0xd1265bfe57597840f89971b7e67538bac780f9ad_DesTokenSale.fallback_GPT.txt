Function Security Analysis for DesTokenSale.fallback()
    The modifier of function fallback are ['stopInEmergency']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier stopInEmergency has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The code in the modifier does not enforce ownership or specific address access, nor does it show any usage of lock operation. The modifier name
          'stopInEmergency' also does not imply specific access control or reentrancy protection. It only seems to manage an 'emergency stop' through the 'halted'
          boolean.
    Check direct function security
        - function DesTokenSale.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not include any requirement or condition checking the identity of msg.sender against a specified Owner or Address.
        - function DesTokenSale.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures that involve statements like require(xxx == True); xxx = False; or require(xxx == False); xxx
          = True;. The require statements check specific conditions without toggling the condition values or setting them directly afterward.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['token.balanceOf(msg.sender).add(tokens)', 'token.transfer(msg.sender,tokens)', 'token.balanceOf(msg.sender)',
    'beneficiary.transfer(msg.value)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - token.transfer(msg.sender,tokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - beneficiary.transfer(msg.value) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call contains the '.transfer('
        keyword indicating it uses transfer.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - token.balanceOf(msg.sender).add(tokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - token.transfer(msg.sender,tokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - token.balanceOf(msg.sender) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['token.balanceOf(msg.sender).add(tokens)', 'token.transfer(msg.sender,tokens)', 'token.balanceOf(msg.sender)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            Yes The provided code is a constructor for the contract named DesTokenSale. This is evident from the fact that the function name matches the contract name
            (DesTokenSale), which is typical for constructors in Solidity for versions before 0.4.22, where the special keyword "constructor" was not used. In addition,
            the state variable "token" is assigned a value using a parameter, which is not hardcoded, so it does not meet the second characteristic.
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            Yes The provided code is a constructor because the function name matches the contract name 'DesTokenSale'.
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            Yes The provided code is a constructor because the function name 'DesTokenSale' matches the contract name 'DesTokenSale'. In Solidity, constructors have the
            same name as the contract in versions prior to 0.4.22, which fits the pattern seen in the code.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
