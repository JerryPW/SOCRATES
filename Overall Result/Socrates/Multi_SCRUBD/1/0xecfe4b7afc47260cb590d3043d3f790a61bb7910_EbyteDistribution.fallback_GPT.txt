Start analyze function: EbyteDistribution.fallback()
Function Security Analysis for EbyteDistribution.fallback()
    The modifier of function fallback are ['onlyWhitelist', 'isUnlocked']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier onlyWhitelist has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier checks if the sender is not in a blacklist but does not enforce that only the owner or specific addresses can execute the function, nor
          does it involve lock operations or suggest inference of owner address by its name.
        - modifier isUnlocked has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: Upon re-evaluation, the code only contains a check for the lock (require(!contractLocked)) but does not reset the flag afterward, thus it doesn't fully
          satisfy rule 2, which requires both lock and unlock operations.
    Check direct function security
        - function EbyteDistribution.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code snippet does not contain any checks or requirements for msg.sender against xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO. There are no require, if, or
          assert statements manipulating msg.sender with these roles.
        - function EbyteDistribution.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the required structures or the specific statements like 'require(xxx == True); xxx = False;' or others described in the
          rules.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['ebyteToken.transfer(investor,toGiveE)', 'ebyteToken.transfer(investor,toGiveT)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - ebyteToken.transfer(investor,toGiveE) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - ebyteToken.transfer(investor,toGiveT) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - ebyteToken.transfer(investor,toGiveE) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - ebyteToken.transfer(investor,toGiveT) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['ebyteToken.transfer(investor,toGiveE)', 'ebyteToken.transfer(investor,toGiveT)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['ebyteToken'] should be checked in variable ebyteToken
        Checked variables: ebyteToken
            Yes The function 'EbyteDistribution' has the same name as the contract name, indicating it is a constructor. Additionally, the state variable 'ebyteToken' is
            being set with the parameter '_tokenAddress', so it is not hardcoded.
        There are ['ebyteToken'] should be checked in variable ebyteToken
        Checked variables: ebyteToken
            Yes The function name 'EbyteDistribution' matches the contract name 'EbyteDistribution', indicating that it is a constructor function. Constructors are
            special functions used during contract deployment to initialize the contract's state.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: EbyteDistribution.getTokenBalance(address)
Function Security Analysis for EbyteDistribution.getTokenBalance(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function getTokenBalance.
    Check direct function security
        - function EbyteDistribution.getTokenBalance(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function 'getTokenBalance' does not contain any checks or assertions related to the msg.sender being an owner, address, leader, or CEO. It simply
          returns the token balance of a given address.
        - function EbyteDistribution.getTokenBalance(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures. It simply retrieves the balance of a token for a given address and returns it.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['ebyteToken.balanceOf(who)']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - ebyteToken.balanceOf(who) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['ebyteToken.balanceOf(who)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['ebyteToken'] should be checked in variable ebyteToken
        Checked variables: ebyteToken
            Yes The function name 'EbyteDistribution' matches the contract name 'EbyteDistribution', which identifies it as a constructor in older versions of Solidity
            before the introduction of the 'constructor' keyword. Thus, it satisfies the first characteristic of being a constructor.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
