Function Security Analysis for Brave3d.overStage(uint8)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function overStage.
    Check direct function security
        - function Brave3d.overStage(uint8) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified require, if, or assert conditions related to the sender address being checked against an
          Owner/Address/Leader/CEO, hence it doesn't meet the criteria outlined.
        - function Brave3d.overStage(uint8) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code contains the statement 'assert(!finishStage.isFinish);', which matches with the structure defined in point 3 of recognizing the presence of
          either 'require(!xxx);' or 'if(!xxx) throw;' followed by 'xxx = True;', confirming the existence of such a construct. However, the function lacks a direct
          equivalent to 'xxx = True;' and 'xxx = False;' matched with an exact 'require' or 'if' conditional error handling as referred by the specification.
          Additionally, there is no explicit throw or revert statement accompanying the if condition, only 'assert' which can be considered a condition check.  According
          to the instructions, none of the exact specified patterns are fully matched, as full pattern satisfaction requires the specified conditional and variable
          assignment structure.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

        Function Security Analysis for Brave3d.forceOverStage()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function forceOverStage.
            Check direct function security
                - function Brave3d.forceOverStage() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The provided function does not check or assert the `msg.sender` against any owner, address, leader, or CEO, nor it uses 'require' or 'assert'
                  statements that would involve 'msg.sender'. It only calls another function without any access control.
                - function Brave3d.forceOverStage() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures. It simply calls the 'overStage' function three times with different
                  parameters.
