Function Security Analysis for UserContract.Initiate(address,uint256,uint256,uint256,bool)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function Initiate.
    Check direct function security
        - function UserContract.Initiate(address,uint256,uint256,uint256,bool) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not check for msg.sender against any role like xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
        - function UserContract.Initiate(address,uint256,uint256,uint256,bool) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided function does not contain either of the required patterns that check and modify the same variable with the specified conditions (e.g.,
          require(xxx == True) followed by changing xxx to False). The require statement in the function checks for a condition on msg.value, which is not the same as
          modifying a specific variable in the subsequent lines. Thus, the function does not match any of the given structures.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['swap.CreateSwap.value(_premium)(_amounta,_amountb,_isLong,msg.sender)', 'factory.getBase()']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - swap.CreateSwap.value(_premium)(_amounta,_amountb,_isLong,msg.sender) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - factory.getBase() ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['swap.CreateSwap.value(_premium)(_amounta,_amountb,_isLong,msg.sender)', 'factory.getBase()']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['swap'] should be checked in variable swap
        Checked variables: swap
            No 1. The provided code is not a constructor as the function names ('Initiate' and 'Enter') do not match the contract name ('UserContract'), nor are they
            explicitly named 'constructor'.   2. The state variable 'swap' is assigned the value of 'TokenToTokenSwap_Interface(_swapadd)' which is not hardcoded but
            passed as a parameter in both functions ('Initiate' and 'Enter'). Therefore, the state variable is not hardcoded as no constant or predefined value is used
            directly as an assignment to 'swap'.  Thus, neither characteristics apply to the provided code.
            Function Security Analysis for UserContract.Initiate(address,uint256,uint256,uint256,bool)
                There are no modifiers should be examined in function Initiate.
                Check direct function security
                    - function UserContract.Initiate(address,uint256,uint256,uint256,bool) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                      Reason: The code does not include any of the required msg.sender checks or assertions mentioned in the criteria.
                    - function UserContract.Initiate(address,uint256,uint256,uint256,bool) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                      Reason: The provided function does not contain any of the specified structure patterns involving require() statements or if statements with throw,
                      alongside variable assignments that switch boolean values.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
