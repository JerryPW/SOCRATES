Function Security Analysis for EthTokenToSmthSwaps.createSwapTarget(bytes20,address,address,uint256,address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function createSwapTarget.
    Check direct function security
        - function EthTokenToSmthSwaps.createSwapTarget(bytes20,address,address,uint256,address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of
        msg.sender
          Reason: None of the require/assert conditions involve checking if msg.sender is equal to a specific owner or leader address, nor does it check for inequality.
          Hence, the function does not match any of the specified structures.
        - function EthTokenToSmthSwaps.createSwapTarget(bytes20,address,address,uint256,address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not implement any of the required structures. It uses `require` statements to enforce conditions for executing the function but
          does not change the value of a specified variable as per the required patterns (like `require(xxx == True)` followed by `xxx = False`, etc.).
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['ERC20(_token).transferFrom(msg.sender,this,_value)']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - ERC20(_token).transferFrom(msg.sender,this,_value) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['ERC20(_token).transferFrom(msg.sender,this,_value)']
    Analyze External Address
        The variable '_token' in external call 'ERC20(_token).transferFrom(msg.sender,this,_value)' has no state variable assigned in
        EthTokenToSmthSwaps.createSwapTarget(bytes20,address,address,uint256,address). Therefore we check whether it has been hardcoded in the function.
            No The function takes '_token' as a parameter and uses it dynamically through the 'ERC20(_token)' which indicates it's not hardcoded within the function body.
            The '_token' variable determines the specific ERC20 token involved in the transfer operation, meaning it can vary based on the function call.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
