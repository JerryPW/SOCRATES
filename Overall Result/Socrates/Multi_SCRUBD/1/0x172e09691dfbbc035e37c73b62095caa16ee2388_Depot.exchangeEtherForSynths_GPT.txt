Function Security Analysis for Depot.exchangeEtherForSynths()
    The modifier of function exchangeEtherForSynths are ['pricesNotStale', 'notPaused']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier pricesNotStale has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier 'pricesNotStale' checks if prices are stale by calling 'pricesAreStale()'. It does not enforce ownership/access restriction, nor does it
          employ a lock mechanism. It purely checks a business logic condition.
        - modifier notPaused has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier checks if the contract is paused by requiring that 'paused' is false before executing the function. This logic does not match any of the
          specified rules related to owner checks, lock operations, or typical naming conventions that indicate restricted access or reentrancy protection.
    Check direct function security
        - function Depot.exchangeEtherForSynths() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any check or assertion for the value or identity of msg.sender corresponding to any of the outlined structures. It lacks a
          direct equality or inequality condition concerning msg.sender and a specific owner or address role (xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO).
        - function Depot.exchangeEtherForSynths() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code includes a section with an inline comment: `// solium-disable-next-line security/no-send` followed by a semantics:
          `if(!deposit.user.send(ethToSend))`, which indicates a conditional check with negation pattern similar to the characteristic structure `{if(!xxx) throw;}`.
          Specifically, `deposit.user.send` can return `false` if sending failed, which is handled by an alternate path but aligns with the required structure with a
          logical negation check handling control flow even though it doesn't throw an exception. However, there's a lack of assignment to a boolean variable as strictly
          required by the conditions 1-4. Hence, the structure examined in-line shows similar handling but doesn't strictly satisfy one of the listed structures due to
          absence of required assignments.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['msg.sender.transfer(remainingToFulfill.divideDecimal(usdToEthPrice))', 'synth.transfer(msg.sender,deposit.amount)',
    'deposit.user.send(ethToSend)', 'synth.transfer(msg.sender,remainingToFulfill)', 'fundsWallet.transfer(ethToSend)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - msg.sender.transfer(remainingToFulfill.divideDecimal(usdToEthPrice)) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason:
        The external call contains '.transfer(' keyword in 'msg.sender.transfer(remainingToFulfill.divideDecimal(usdToEthPrice))'.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - synth.transfer(msg.sender,deposit.amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - deposit.user.send(ethToSend) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains '.send('
        keyword in 'deposit.user.send(ethToSend)'.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - synth.transfer(msg.sender,remainingToFulfill) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - fundsWallet.transfer(ethToSend) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains
        '.transfer(' keyword in 'fundsWallet.transfer(ethToSend)'.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - synth.transfer(msg.sender,deposit.amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - synth.transfer(msg.sender,remainingToFulfill) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['synth.transfer(msg.sender,deposit.amount)', 'synth.transfer(msg.sender,remainingToFulfill)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['synth'] should be checked in variable synth
        Checked variables: synth
            Yes The provided piece of code contains a constructor function that matches the contract's name or is explicitly named 'constructor'. The function also sets
            the state variable 'synth' within the constructor, adhering to the first characteristic outlined in the task.
        There are ['synth'] should be checked in variable synth
        Checked variables: synth
            Yes The given code contains a function explicitly named 'constructor', which is characteristic of a contract constructor. Therefore, this satisfies the first
            characteristic provided.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
