Function Security Analysis for VotingChallenge.sendReward(address)
    The modifier of function sendReward are ['afterVotingPeriod']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier afterVotingPeriod has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier `afterVotingPeriod` checks the condition on `isVotingPeriod`, which does not correspond to checking if only specific addresses can execute
          a function, and there is no use of a lock mechanism as described. Thus, none of the rules apply.
    Check direct function security
        - function VotingChallenge.sendReward(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the required structural patterns that check for msg.sender against a specific owner or address.
        - function VotingChallenge.sendReward(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures or conditions as outlined in the prompt. It primarily deals with reward distribution
          based on votes without any explicit conditional requirements or state changes that match the given patterns.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['forwarder.forward.value(sum)(referrer2,to)', 'forwarder.forward.value(sum)(referrer1,to)', 'to.transfer(reward+voters[to].fullVotes[winner])']
    Analyze Transfer
        - to.transfer(reward+voters[to].fullVotes[winner]) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        'to.transfer(reward+voters[to].fullVotes[winner])' contains the keyword '.transfer('. Therefore, it satisfies the first characteristic.. Parameter in
        'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - forwarder.forward.value(sum)(referrer2,to) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - forwarder.forward.value(sum)(referrer1,to) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['forwarder.forward.value(sum)(referrer2,to)', 'forwarder.forward.value(sum)(referrer1,to)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['forwarder'] should be checked in variable forwarder
        Checked variables: forwarder
            Yes The function provided is a constructor because its name is 'constructor', which is explicitly named to match the typical pattern for constructors in
            Solidity after version 0.4.22.
        There are ['forwarder'] should be checked in variable forwarder
        Checked variables: forwarder
            Yes The code provided is a constructor, as indicated by the function name 'constructor', which matches the second characteristic where the function name is
            explicitly named 'constructor'. Additionally, the constructor takes an address argument '_forwarder' and assigns it to the state variable 'forwarder', but the
            state variable itself is not hardcoded in the constructor, i.e., it is set based on the constructor's input rather than on a hardcoded address. Thus, only the
            first characteristic applies.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
