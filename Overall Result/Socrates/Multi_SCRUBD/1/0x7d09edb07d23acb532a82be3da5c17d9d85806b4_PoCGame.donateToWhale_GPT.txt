Function Security Analysis for PoCGame.donateToWhale(uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function donateToWhale.
    Check direct function security
        - function PoCGame.donateToWhale(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not check if the msg.sender is a specific Owner/Address/Leader or CEO before executing its logic. It only performs an action of
          calling a function on another contract and updates the total donated variable, emitting an event afterwards.
        - function PoCGame.donateToWhale(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code uses a simple internal function to facilitate a donation transaction without any checks or conditional structures. It calls a function
          on the whale contract and emits an event afterward, without using require statements to conditionally evaluate or toggle variable states according to the
          specified patterns. There are also no if/throw patterns in place, confirming that none of the variations like require(xxx == True), require(xxx == False), or
          related variable handling according to the specified structures are present.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['donate']
        Function Security Analysis for PoCGame.donate()
            The modifier of function donate are ['isOpenToPublic']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier isOpenToPublic has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier only checks if the contract is open to the public via "require(openToPublic);", but it does not enforce ownership or a specific
                  address check, nor does it implement a reentrancy lock. None of the rules apply.
            Check direct function security
                - function PoCGame.donate() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain any requirements or conditions on msg.sender being equal to or different from a specific Owner, Address, Leader, or
                  CEO.
                - function PoCGame.donate() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided function does not contain any 'require' statements or conditional checks that match the specified structures. There are no
                  variables being set to boolean values after a 'require' or 'if' condition check, making it ineligible for the criteria given.

    Analyze Gas
        - whale.call.value(amount)(bytes4(keccak256()(donate()))) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['whale.call.value(amount)(bytes4(keccak256()(donate())))']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['whale'] should be checked in variable whale
        Checked variables: whale
            Yes The provided code is a constructor, as the function is explicitly named 'constructor'. It also assigns a value to the state variable 'whale' using a
            parameter 'whaleAddress', rather than a hardcoded value.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
