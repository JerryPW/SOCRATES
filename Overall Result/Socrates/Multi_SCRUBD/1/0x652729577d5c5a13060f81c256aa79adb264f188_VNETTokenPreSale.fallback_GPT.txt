External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['vnetToken.balanceOf(address(this))', 'vnetToken.transfer(msg.sender,vnetAmount)', 'vnetToken.transfer(msg.sender,vnetBalance)',
    'msg.sender.transfer(weiAmount.sub(weiExpend))']
    Analyze Transfer
        - vnetToken.transfer(msg.sender,vnetAmount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - vnetToken.transfer(msg.sender,vnetBalance) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - msg.sender.transfer(weiAmount.sub(weiExpend)) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The fourth external
        call 'msg.sender.transfer(weiAmount.sub(weiExpend))' contains the '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - vnetToken.balanceOf(address(this)) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - vnetToken.transfer(msg.sender,vnetAmount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - vnetToken.transfer(msg.sender,vnetBalance) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['vnetToken.balanceOf(address(this))', 'vnetToken.transfer(msg.sender,vnetAmount)', 'vnetToken.transfer(msg.sender,vnetBalance)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['vnetToken'] should be checked in variable vnetToken
        Checked variables: vnetToken
            Yes The function is explicitly named 'constructor', which indicates that it is a constructor function.
        There are ['vnetToken'] should be checked in variable vnetToken
        Checked variables: vnetToken
            Yes The provided code is a constructor because it is explicitly named 'constructor'. In Solidity, a constructor is a special function that is executed only
            once when a contract is deployed. The presence of the 'constructor' keyword indicates that this function is indeed a constructor, fulfilling the first
            characteristic outlined.
        There are ['vnetToken'] should be checked in variable vnetToken
        Checked variables: vnetToken
            Yes The function provided is a constructor as its name is 'constructor'. Constructors are identified by having the same name as the contract or being
            explicitly named 'constructor'. Since this function is named 'constructor', it satisfies the constructor characteristic.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
