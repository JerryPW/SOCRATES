Function Security Analysis for ViVICO.contribute()
    The modifier of function contribute are ['notFinishedOrHold']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier notFinishedOrHold has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier checks the state and does not relate to the characteristics specified (checking the sender's address or using a lock operation).
    Check direct function security
        - function ViVICO.contribute() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not include any of the specified patterns where "msg.sender" is compared to an owner or similar role. The conditions are primarily
          focused on whitelist, state validation, and KYC checks.
        - function ViVICO.contribute() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code doesn't meet any of the specified structural patterns. It doesn't contain a pattern where a 'require' function checks a boolean variable (xxx)
          and then changes its value. It only contains require statements with other logical conditions unrelated to the modification of a boolean variable as a result of
          the 'require' check.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,tokenBought.add(tempBalance))']
    Analyze Transfer
        - tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,tokenBought.add(tempBalance)) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,tokenBought.add(tempBalance)) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,tokenBought.add(tempBalance))']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['tokenReward'] should be checked in variable tokenReward
        Checked variables: tokenReward
            Yes The code provided indicates a constructor function because it explicitly uses the 'constructor' keyword in the function definition. This matches the
            criteria for identifying a constructor, fulfilling the first characteristic. Therefore, the function meets at least one of the specified characteristics.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: ViVICO.checkIfFundingCompleteOrExpired()
Function Security Analysis for ViVICO.checkIfFundingCompleteOrExpired()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function checkIfFundingCompleteOrExpired.
    Check direct function security
        - function ViVICO.checkIfFundingCompleteOrExpired() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any conditional checks or assertions that directly involve comparing msg.sender with a variable or constant representing an
          owner, leader, or any administrative address as specified in the required characteristics.
        - function ViVICO.checkIfFundingCompleteOrExpired() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any 'require' statements or specific condition and assignment structures mentioned in the characteristics. All logic is based
          on 'if-else' constructs without using require or similar checks with variable assignments as outlined.

    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: ViVICO.successful()
Function Security Analysis for ViVICO.successful()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function successful.
    Check direct function security
        - function ViVICO.successful() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any condition or assertion that directly involves msg.sender compared against an owner, leader, address etc., which matches
          any of the provided patterns.
        - function ViVICO.successful() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code includes the statement 'require(state == State.Successful);' but it does not modify the 'state' variable following the pattern required by the
          structures listed in the prompt. Thus, it does not match any of the provided structures.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['creator.transfer(address(this).balance)', 'tokenReward.balanceOf(this)', 'tokenReward.transfer(creator,remanent)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - creator.transfer(address(this).balance) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        'creator.transfer(address(this).balance)' contains the '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - tokenReward.transfer(creator,remanent) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - tokenReward.balanceOf(this) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - tokenReward.transfer(creator,remanent) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['tokenReward.balanceOf(this)', 'tokenReward.transfer(creator,remanent)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['tokenReward'] should be checked in variable tokenReward
        Checked variables: tokenReward
            Yes The provided code is a constructor because the function is explicitly named 'constructor', which matches the requirement for characteristic 1.
        There are ['tokenReward'] should be checked in variable tokenReward
        Checked variables: tokenReward
            Yes The provided code appears to be a constructor for the contract ViVICO. This is because the function is explicitly named 'constructor', meeting the
            conditions of characteristic 1. Therefore, it satisfies one of the specified characteristics.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
