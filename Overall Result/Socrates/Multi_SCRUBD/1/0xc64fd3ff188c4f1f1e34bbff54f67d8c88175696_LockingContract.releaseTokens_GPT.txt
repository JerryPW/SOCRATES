Function Security Analysis for LockingContract.releaseTokens(address)
    The modifier of function releaseTokens are ['onlyWhenUnlocked']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier onlyWhenUnlocked has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: Upon reevaluation, the modifier `onlyWhenUnlocked` uses `require(!isLocked())`, which only checks if a lock condition is false. This indicates an unlock
          verification but does not explicitly show a locking mechanism being set and reset in the code. Thus, it does not satisfy condition 2 as it only partially
          matches the lock operation by checking if something is unlocked but does not encompass the entire lock-unlock pattern required. None of the other conditions are
          met either.
