Function Security Analysis for DividendDistributor.distributeDividend(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function distributeDividend.
    Check direct function security
        - function DividendDistributor.distributeDividend(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not check if the msg.sender is a specific owner, address, leader, or CEO.
        - function DividendDistributor.distributeDividend(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the required structures involving require or if statements that throw based on a condition about a boolean variable
          and then set that variable. The conditions are based on checks using numeric values, not boolean variables.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['process', 'claimDividend', 'setShare']
        Function Security Analysis for DividendDistributor.process(uint256)
            The modifier of function process are ['onlyToken']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyToken is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The code uses require(msg.sender == _token), which restricts access to the function to the address stored in _token. This satisfies rule 1,
                  which involves checking if only specific addresses can execute the function using require. There are no lock operations in the code to satisfy rule 2,
                  and the modifier name does not suggest inherent restrictions except for specific addresses as per rule 1.
        Function Security Analysis for DividendDistributor.claimDividend()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function claimDividend.
            Check direct function security
                - function DividendDistributor.claimDividend() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not involve any checks or assertions related to msg.sender being an owner, address, leader or CEO.
                - function DividendDistributor.claimDividend() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code provided does not contain any of the specified structures as it only has a function `claimDividend` that calls another function
                  `distributeDividend`. There are no `require` statements or conditions checking a variable's boolean state and then changing that same variable's state.

    Analyze Transfer
        - EP.transfer(shareholder,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - EP.transfer(shareholder,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['EP.transfer(shareholder,amount)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['EP'] should be checked in variable EP
        Checked variables: EP
            State variable EP has initialized in public area after declaration.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
