Function Security Analysis for HeroAuction.orderOnFightAuction(uint256,uint256,uint256)
    The modifier of function orderOnFightAuction are ['whenNotPaused']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier whenNotPaused has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier whenNotPaused() checks if the contract is not paused by using the 'require(!paused);' statement. There are no owner checks, specified
          address checks, or lock operation mechanisms involved here, nor does the function name imply such operations directly (e.g., not like Onlyxxx or nonReentrant).
    Check direct function security
        - function HeroAuction.orderOnFightAuction(uint256,uint256,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The provided code does not have any statement checking if msg.sender is equal to a specific owner, address, or role, like xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader,
          or CEO.
        - function HeroAuction.orderOnFightAuction(uint256,uint256,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures where a variable is checked with a specific condition using 'require', assigned a new boolean
          value immediately following the 'require', and optionally reassigned later with a boolean value.

        There are ['fightAuction'] should be checked in variable fightAuction
        Checked variables: fightAuction
            No The code provided is a function called 'setFightAuctionAddress'. It does not match the contract name 'HeroAuction', nor is it explicitly named
            'constructor'. Hence, it does not satisfy characteristic 1.  Regarding characteristic 2, the function updates the state variable 'fightAuction' but the value
            it sets ('fightAuction = candidateContract;') is not hardcoded; instead it is dynamic based on the input parameter '_address'. Therefore, it does not satisfy
            characteristic 2 either.  Since none of the characteristics are satisfied, the answer is 'No'.
            Function Security Analysis for HeroAuction.setFightAuctionAddress(address)
                The modifier of function setFightAuctionAddress are ['onlyLeader']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyLeader is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The modifier contains the statement 'require(msg.sender == leaderAddress);', which enforces that only the leader (specific address) can
                      execute the function. This matches characteristic 1 entirely. There are no structural omissions in this context.
        There are ['fightAuction'] should be checked in variable fightAuction
        Checked variables: fightAuction
            No The function 'setFightAuctionAddress' is not a constructor because it does not share its name with the contract name 'HeroAuction' nor is it explicitly
            named 'constructor'. Further, it does not involve hardcoding of the state variable 'fightAuction'. Instead, it assigns a value to 'fightAuction' based on the
            address provided during function execution and the validation against the 'isFightClockAuction' function, rather than using a hardcoded value.
            Function Security Analysis for HeroAuction.setFightAuctionAddress(address)
                The modifier of function setFightAuctionAddress are ['onlyLeader']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyLeader is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The code includes `require(msg.sender == leaderAddress);`, which matches rule 1 by enforcing that only the leaderAddress can execute the
                      function.
        There are ['fightAuction'] should be checked in variable fightAuction
        Checked variables: fightAuction
            No The provided function does not have a name that matches the contract name ('HeroAuction') and is not explicitly named 'constructor'. Therefore, it is not a
            constructor. Additionally, the function updates the state variable 'fightAuction' with a value passed as a parameter, not a hardcoded one. Therefore, it does
            not satisfy the second characteristic either. Since neither characteristic is satisfied, the answer is 'No'.
            Function Security Analysis for HeroAuction.setFightAuctionAddress(address)
                The modifier of function setFightAuctionAddress are ['onlyLeader']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyLeader is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The code has a statement 'require(msg.sender == leaderAddress);' which enforces that only the leader can execute the function that uses this
                      modifier. This satisfies the condition 1 where access is restricted based on a specific address or owner. There are no lock or unlock operations
                      present in the code for condition 2.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: HeroFighting._fight(uint32,uint32)
Function Security Analysis for HeroFighting._fight(uint32,uint32)
    The modifier of function _fight are ['whenNotPaused']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier whenNotPaused has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier 'whenNotPaused' does not clearly enforce owner-specific execution nor does it imply a lock mechanism. It simply checks if a 'paused' state
          is false before executing the function.
    Check direct function security
        - function HeroFighting._fight(uint32,uint32) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not include any require checks or conditional statements involving msg.sender against an owner or leader address.
        - function HeroFighting._fight(uint32,uint32) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon reevaluating the code, it appears I made an oversight. The code snippet includes the statement 'if(!flag){ (_yinId,_yangId) = (_yangId,_yinId); }'.
          This indeed matches 'if(!flag)' portion of structure 4, but the required 'throw;' statement is missing in this conditional block. Therefore, it does not fulfill
          the complete pattern of any specified structure.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['orderOnFightAuction']
        Function Security Analysis for HeroAuction.orderOnFightAuction(uint256,uint256,uint256)
            The modifier of function orderOnFightAuction are ['whenNotPaused']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier whenNotPaused has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier checks if a 'paused' variable is false. It doesn't enforce sender restrictions or a lock mechanism. It is unrelated to ownership
                  checks or reentrancy protection.
            Check direct function security
                - function HeroAuction.orderOnFightAuction(uint256,uint256,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any checks that correspond to the required structures for msg.sender verification based on ownership or specific
                  roles like xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO.
                - function HeroAuction.orderOnFightAuction(uint256,uint256,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The function does not contain any of the required sequences such as requiring a variable to be True or False, followed by setting it to the
                  opposite boolean value.

            No The function 'setMasterRecruitmentAddress' is not a constructor because it doesn't match the contract name 'HeroAuction' and it's not explicitly named
            'constructor'. The function doesn't hardcode the state variable 'masterRecruitment'; it sets it using a passed parameter '_address', which implies it is
            dynamically set rather than hardcoded.

                The modifier of function setMasterRecruitmentAddress are ['onlyLeader']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyLeader is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The code contains 'require(msg.sender == leaderAddress);', which enforces that only the address 'leaderAddress' can execute the function.
                      This satisfies rule 1 as described.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
