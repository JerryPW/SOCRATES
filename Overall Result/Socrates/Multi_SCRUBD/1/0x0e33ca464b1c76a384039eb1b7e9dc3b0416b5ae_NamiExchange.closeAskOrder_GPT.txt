Function Security Analysis for NamiExchange.closeAskOrder()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function closeAskOrder.
    Check direct function security
        - function NamiExchange.closeAskOrder() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any checks involving msg.sender being compared to or required to be any specific address labeled as xxxOwner, Leader, CEO, or
          similar.
        - function NamiExchange.closeAskOrder() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures: there are no require statements that check a boolean condition on a specific variable with
          subsequent assignments flipping its boolean value; instead, it checks a condition involving numeric properties for volume and price, and updates the volume but
          does not follow the specified patterns.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['namiToken.transfer(msg.sender,ask[msg.sender].volume)', 'namiToken.balanceOf(msg.sender)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - namiToken.transfer(msg.sender,ask[msg.sender].volume) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - namiToken.transfer(msg.sender,ask[msg.sender].volume) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - namiToken.balanceOf(msg.sender) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['namiToken.transfer(msg.sender,ask[msg.sender].volume)', 'namiToken.balanceOf(msg.sender)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['NamiAddr'] should be checked in variable namiToken
        Checked variables: NamiAddr
            Yes The function name 'NamiExchange' matches the contract name 'NamiExchange', which suggests that it is a constructor function. Therefore, it satisfies the
            first characteristic.
        There are ['NamiAddr'] should be checked in variable namiToken
        Checked variables: NamiAddr
            Yes The function name "NamiExchange" matches the contract name, which indicates that the function is a constructor. Constructors are special functions in
            Solidity that initialize contract state when the contract is deployed and they share the same name as the contract in older versions of Solidity.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
