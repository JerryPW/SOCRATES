Function Security Analysis for ViVICO.refund()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function refund.
    Check direct function security
        - function ViVICO.refund() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code doesn't have any condition based on msg.sender being equal to or not equal to xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
        - function ViVICO.refund() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon reevaluation, the code does not satisfy any of the given structures fully. The initial answer was incorrect because, while there is a require
          statement `require(state == State.Failed);`, there is no subsequent assignment of `state = False;` or `state = True;`. Thus, the first structure pattern is not
          fully matched, as both required statements must appear in conjunction. None of the other specified structures are present either.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['tokenReward.transfer(creator,remanent)', 'creator.transfer(address(this).balance)', 'msg.sender.transfer(holderETH)',
    'tokenReward.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),holderTokens)', 'tokenReward.balanceOf(this)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - tokenReward.transfer(creator,remanent) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - creator.transfer(address(this).balance) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains
        '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - msg.sender.transfer(holderETH) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains
        '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - tokenReward.transfer(creator,remanent) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - tokenReward.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),holderTokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - tokenReward.balanceOf(this) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['tokenReward.transfer(creator,remanent)', 'tokenReward.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),holderTokens)', 'tokenReward.balanceOf(this)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['tokenReward'] should be checked in variable tokenReward
        Checked variables: tokenReward
            Yes The provided code is a constructor named 'constructor', initializing the contract with a parameter '_addressOfTokenUsedAsReward'. This satisfies the first
            characteristic by explicitly being a constructor.
        There are ['tokenReward'] should be checked in variable tokenReward
        Checked variables: tokenReward
            Yes The function provided in the code is a constructor as it matches the second condition in the rules: the function is explicitly named 'constructor'.
            Therefore, it satisfies the first characteristic where the provided code is a constructor function.
        There are ['tokenReward'] should be checked in variable tokenReward
        Checked variables: tokenReward
            Yes The provided code has a constructor function, as indicated by the use of the 'constructor' keyword. In this function, the state variable 'tokenReward' is
            being assigned a value using the parameter '_addressOfTokenUsedAsReward'. This satisfies the first characteristic because the function is a constructor.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
