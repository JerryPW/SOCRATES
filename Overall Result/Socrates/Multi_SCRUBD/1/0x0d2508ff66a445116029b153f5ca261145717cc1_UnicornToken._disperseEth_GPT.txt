Function Security Analysis for UnicornToken._disperseEth()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _disperseEth.
    Check direct function security
        - function UnicornToken._disperseEth() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The provided code snippet does not contain any checks or conditions involving 'msg.sender' in relation to an owner or address requirement.
        - function UnicornToken._disperseEth() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not meet any of the specified structural conditions. It lacks the 'require' or 'if(!xxx) throw' statements expected for evaluating
          specific boolean conditions and changing them subsequently, as described.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['_tax', 'transfer', 'transferFrom', '_transfer']
        Function Security Analysis for UnicornToken._tax(address)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function _tax.
            Check direct function security
                - function UnicornToken._tax(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures involving msg.sender. It checks a condition on _sender, not msg.sender.
                - function UnicornToken._tax(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The given code does not include any of the specified structures. It doesn't have 'require' or 'if' statements checking the truthiness or falsity
                  of a variable and setting it to its opposite value accordingly.
            Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
            The reachable functions are ['transfer', 'transferFrom', '_transfer']
                Function Security Analysis for UnicornToken.transfer(address,uint256)
                    There are no modifiers should be examined in function transfer.
                    Check direct function security
                        - function UnicornToken.transfer(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                          Reason: The provided function does not include any of the specified structures involving msg.sender.
                        - function UnicornToken.transfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures involving 'require' or 'if(!xxx) throw'. It is a simple function that
                          calls another function and returns a boolean value directly.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['m_EthReflectSvcAddress.transfer(m_EthReflectAmount)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - m_EthReflectSvcAddress.transfer(m_EthReflectAmount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external
        call contains the '.transfer(' keyword, which satisfies one of the specified characteristics.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Function Security Analysis for Taxable.payTaxes(uint256,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function payTaxes.
    Check direct function security
        - function Taxable.payTaxes(uint256,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The given code does not include any checks or statements related to 'msg.sender'. The function lacks any of the specified structures that compare
          'msg.sender' to owner or managerial roles.
        - function Taxable.payTaxes(uint256,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any require or if statements with the specific patterns listed in the criteria, such as require(xxx == True), require(xxx ==
          False), require(!xxx), or if(!xxx) throw within the structure described.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

        Function Security Analysis for UnicornToken._tax(address)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function _tax.
            Check direct function security
                - function UnicornToken._tax(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any require, if-check with msg.sender related to checkAuthorizeOwner or similar logic.
                - function UnicornToken._tax(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not have any 'require' statements or direct conditional checks with a throw. It also does not toggle a boolean variable between
                  True and False. It only performs operations when _readyToTax returns true, without altering any boolean state variable. Hence, it doesn't match any of
                  the specified structures.
            Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

                    Check direct function security
                        - function UnicornToken.transfer(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                          Reason: The function does not include any checks for the authenticity of the sender as the owner, address, leader, or CEO using msg.sender.
                        - function UnicornToken.transfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures that involve conditional checks using 'require' or 'if' followed by
                          variable assignments that match the given patterns.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['_address.transfer(_amount)', 'External.deposit(_amount)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - _address.transfer(_amount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call '_address.transfer(_amount)'
        contains the keyword '.transfer('.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - External.deposit(_amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['External.deposit(_amount)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['External'] should be checked in variable External
        Checked variables: External
            No The provided function 'initTax' does not satisfy the first characteristic as it is not a constructor. The function name, 'initTax', does not match the
            contract name 'UnicornToken' nor is it explicitly named 'constructor'. The second characteristic is also not satisfied as there is no direct hardcoding of the
            specific state variable 'External' within the function code; the 'External' in the function refers to an assignment of a new instance of 'FTPExternal', not a
            state variable that matches 'External'.

                Check direct function security
                    - function Taxable.initTax() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                      Reason: The code does not have any require or assert statements checking msg.sender against owner or address roles.
                    - function Taxable.initTax() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                      Reason: The given code does not contain any require or if statement that matches the specified conditions. It directly assigns values to variables
                      and calls a function, without any conditional check or state change as specified.
                Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
                The reachable functions are ['constructor']
                    Function Security Analysis for UnicornToken.constructor()
                        This is a constructor.
