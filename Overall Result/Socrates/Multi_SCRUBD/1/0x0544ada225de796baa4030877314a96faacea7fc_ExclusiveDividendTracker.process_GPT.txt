Function Security Analysis for ExclusiveDividendTracker.process(uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function process.
    Check direct function security
        - function ExclusiveDividendTracker.process(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not include any checks for msg.sender being compared to an xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO as outlined in the listed characteristics.
          It only manipulates tokenHoldersMap and uses gas without involving ownership or authority verification based on msg.sender.
        - function ExclusiveDividendTracker.process(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided function does not contain any of the structures specified for matching. It involves checking if `numberOfTokenHolders` is zero and if
          `_lastProcessedIndex` exceeds the size of `tokenHoldersMap`, but none of these checks involve requiring a boolean variable to be set in a specific way as per
          the given structures.

Start analyze function: ExclusiveDividendTracker.processAccount(address,bool)
Function Security Analysis for ExclusiveDividendTracker.processAccount(address,bool)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function processAccount.
    Check direct function security
        - function ExclusiveDividendTracker.processAccount(address,bool) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any statement verifying the sender's identity using `msg.sender`. There are no access controls or restrictions based on
          the sender's address, nor any use of require, if, or assert with respect to `msg.sender`.
        - function ExclusiveDividendTracker.processAccount(address,bool) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not demonstrate any of the specified characteristics or structures. It simply defines a function that processes an account and does
          not contain any 'require' or 'throw' statements with a pattern matching the four described cases.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['processAccountByDeployer', 'process', 'setTokenBalance']
        Function Security Analysis for ExclusiveDividendTracker.processAccountByDeployer(address,bool)
            The modifier of function processAccountByDeployer are ['onlyOwner']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: Upon reviewing the code, the modifier uses `require(_owner == _msgSender())`, which checks if the caller of the function is the owner. This
                  fulfills characteristic 1, which ensures that only the owner or specific addresses can execute the function. There are no structural omissions in this
                  judgment, as it clearly matches characteristic 1.
        Function Security Analysis for ExclusiveDividendTracker.process(uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function process.
            Check direct function security
                - function ExclusiveDividendTracker.process(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: None of the conditional checks involve msg.sender directly.
                - function ExclusiveDividendTracker.process(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures. It lacks the required `require` statements with conditions or the `throw` statement
                  that the given patterns describe. The code primarily consists of a loop processing token holders, checking conditions, and tracking gas usage and
                  claims, but it does not follow the required pseudo-code structures.

Start analyze function: ExclusiveDividendTracker._withdrawDividendOfUser(address)
Function Security Analysis for ExclusiveDividendTracker._withdrawDividendOfUser(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _withdrawDividendOfUser.
    Check direct function security
        - function ExclusiveDividendTracker._withdrawDividendOfUser(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not check if msg.sender is equal to a specific owner, address, leader, or CEO, nor does it throw an exception based on msg.sender. It does
          not have any usual authorization pattern based on the msg.sender value.
        - function ExclusiveDividendTracker._withdrawDividendOfUser(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures such as 'require(xxx == True)', 'require(xxx == False)', 'require(!xxx)', or 'if(!xxx) throw'
          combined with the variable being set to True or False as necessary.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['processAccountByDeployer', 'setTokenBalance', 'processAccount', 'process', 'withdrawDividend']
        Function Security Analysis for ExclusiveDividendTracker.processAccountByDeployer(address,bool)
            The modifier of function processAccountByDeployer are ['onlyOwner']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: Re-evaluated the provided modifier code. The code enforces that only the owner can execute the function using require(_owner == _msgSender(),
                  "Ownable: caller is not the owner"). This matches the first characteristic of checking whether only the owner or specific addresses can execute the
                  function. No structural omissions are present, as this single statement suffices for the rule 1 determination. Rule 2 regarding lock operation does not
                  apply here, as there is no locking mechanism in the provided code.
        Function Security Analysis for ExclusiveDividendTracker.setTokenBalance(address)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function setTokenBalance.
            Check direct function security
                - function ExclusiveDividendTracker.setTokenBalance(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: There is no condition that checks if msg.sender matches any roles like Owner, Address, Leader, or CEO.
                - function ExclusiveDividendTracker.setTokenBalance(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures. It involves checking conditions and updating balances without requiring or
                  throwing based on the conditions outlined for the characteristics.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['user.call{gas:3000,value:_withdrawableDividend}()']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - user.call{gas:3000,value:_withdrawableDividend}() is subjected to gas limits 3000. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem.
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
