Function Security Analysis for ShibaUncle._transfer(address,address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _transfer.
    Check direct function security
        - function ShibaUncle._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any checks where msg.sender is compared to an owner, address, leader, or CEO role, as specifically required by the
          structures. The condition 'if (msg.sender != pair ...)' does not refer to an entity like an owner or leader which the guidelines describe, so it doesn't satisfy
          any of the check structures.
        - function ShibaUncle._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code doesn't satisfy any of the given structures. It uses require statements, but these do not fit the specific patterns described in the
          criteria, such as checking for a variable and subsequently setting it to a boolean value. Instead, they perform checks on function parameters and call external
          functions.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transferFrom', 'transfer']
        Function Security Analysis for ShibaUncle.transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transferFrom.
            Check direct function security
                - function ShibaUncle.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not include any checks or assertions related to msg.sender being compared against a specific owner, address, or role such as
                  Leader or CEO.
                - function ShibaUncle.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures related to requirement or conditional assignment of a boolean variable as described.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['coolUncle.setShare(sender,_balances[sender])', 'coolUncle.setShare(recipient,_balances[recipient])']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - coolUncle.setShare(sender,_balances[sender]) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - coolUncle.setShare(recipient,_balances[recipient]) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['coolUncle.setShare(sender,_balances[sender])', 'coolUncle.setShare(recipient,_balances[recipient])']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['coolUncle'] should be checked in variable coolUncle
        Checked variables: coolUncle
            Yes The function provided is a constructor for the contract as it is explicitly named 'constructor'.
        There are ['coolUncle'] should be checked in variable coolUncle
        Checked variables: coolUncle
            Yes The provided code contains a constructor function for the contract. The function is named 'constructor', which matches the criteria for identifying a
            constructor function.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: ShibaUncle.swapBack()
Function Security Analysis for ShibaUncle.swapBack()
    The modifier of function swapBack are ['lockTheSwap']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier lockTheSwap is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: Upon reviewing the modifier 'lockTheSwap', it sets 'inSwapAndLiquify' to true before the function runs and sets it to false afterward. This fulfills the
          requirement of both lock and unlock operations, hence it matches rule 2 correctly.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
