Start analyze function: Contagion.Sort()
Function Security Analysis for Contagion.Sort()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function Sort.
    Check direct function security
        - function Contagion.Sort() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures related to checking if msg.sender equals or not equals a specific owner, address, leader, or
          CEO. It only assigns values without conditions tied to msg.sender.
        - function Contagion.Sort() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the described structures such as 'require(xxx == True); xxx = False;', 'require(xxx == False); xxx = True;',
          'require(!xxx); xxx = True;', or 'if(!xxx) throw; xxx = true;'. Instead, it is manipulating variables related to transaction processing without any conditional
          logic meeting the criteria.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['fallback']
        Function Security Analysis for Contagion.fallback()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
            Check direct function security
                - function Contagion.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not check the identity of msg.sender against any owner, address, Leader, or CEO.
                - function Contagion.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not match any of the structures defined in the criterion. It only checks if `msg.value` is greater than or equal to 0.01 ether,
                  and there is no boolean variable being toggled between true and false as per the defined criteria.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['owner.send(feecounter)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - owner.send(feecounter) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the keyword
        '.send('.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
