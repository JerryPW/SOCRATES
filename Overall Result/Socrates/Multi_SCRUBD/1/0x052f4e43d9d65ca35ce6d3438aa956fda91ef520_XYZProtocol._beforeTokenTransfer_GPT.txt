Function Security Analysis for XYZProtocol._beforeTokenTransfer(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _beforeTokenTransfer.
    Check direct function security
        - function XYZProtocol._beforeTokenTransfer(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not check or require that msg.sender is a specific owner, address, Leader, or CEO. It deals with token balance and swap operations without
          ownership checks.
        - function XYZProtocol._beforeTokenTransfer(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon reviewing the provided code, the initial assessment doesn't hold because the structure requires both 'if(!xxx) throw;' and 'xxx = true;'. In this
          case, the code has 'if (!isInPresale)' which acts as a condition check, but there are no statements like 'throw' to match the 'throw' requirement. Also, there's
          no assignment like 'isInPresale = true;'. Similarly, for 'swapping', the structure 'xxx = true;' and 'xxx = False;' doesn't have a corresponding 'if(!xxx)
          throw;' or a require statement. Thus, none of the required structures are completely present.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['_transfer', 'transferFrom', 'transfer']
        Function Security Analysis for XYZProtocol._transfer(address,address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function _transfer.
            Check direct function security
                - function XYZProtocol._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any checks for msg.sender, hence it doesn't match any of the specified structures where msg.sender is checked
                  against an owner or specific address.
                - function XYZProtocol._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified patterns such as 'require(xxx == True); xxx = False;' or variations thereof.
            Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
            The reachable functions are ['transferFrom', 'transfer']
                Function Security Analysis for XYZProtocol.transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
                    There are no modifiers should be examined in function transferFrom.
                    Check direct function security
                        - function XYZProtocol.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                          Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures involving msg.sender comparison to Owner, Address, Leader, or CEO.
                        - function XYZProtocol.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                          Reason: The given function does not contain the required structure where a boolean condition is checked and then altered as described. There are
                          no statements in the form of require(condition == boolean_value) or if(!condition) throw, followed by reassignments of the condition variable or
                          similar variable manipulations.

Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: XYZProtocol.swapBack()
Function Security Analysis for XYZProtocol.swapBack()
    The modifier of function swapBack are ['nonReentrant']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier nonReentrant is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The modifier enforces the lock operation by setting the _status variable to _ENTERED at the beginning, and resets it to _NOT_ENTERED at the end,
          ensuring the function enters only once. This matches Rule 2 completely, and the modifier's name 'nonReentrant' also aligns with Rule 3.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
