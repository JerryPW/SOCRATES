          msg.sender but none match the criteria.
        - function Sargasso.preApproveTokens(address,uint256) has security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: In the provided code, after the state of `secondaryUserLock[msg.sender]` is checked with `require(secondaryUserLock[msg.sender] == false);`, it is
          immediately set to `true` on the next line `secondaryUserLock[msg.sender] = true;`. This state negation operation occurs before the main logic of the function
          is executed, meeting the requirements for the structural pattern. Therefore, the code satisfies the criteria for the pattern.
