Function Security Analysis for ShortOrder.exerciseLong(address[2],uint256[8],uint8,bytes32[2])
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function exerciseLong.
    Check direct function security
        - function ShortOrder.exerciseLong(address[2],uint256[8],uint8,bytes32[2]) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The given code does not contain any of the specified structures involving `msg.sender`. It uses `msg.sender` for operations, but not in the context of
          ownership or access control checks as described by the conditions.
        - function ShortOrder.exerciseLong(address[2],uint256[8],uint8,bytes32[2]) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures. It consists mainly of variable definitions, calculations, conditional statements, function
          calls, and event emissions, but lacks the require statements with specific state changes or exception handling in the described pattern.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['msg.sender.transfer(couponAmount)', 'Token(tokenUser[0]).transfer(msg.sender,amount)',
    'msg.sender.transfer(safeAdd(couponAmount,orderRecord[tokenUser[1]][orderHash].longBalance[msg.sender]))']
    Analyze Transfer
        - msg.sender.transfer(couponAmount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call contains the '.transfer('
        keyword, so it satisfies the condition.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - msg.sender.transfer(safeAdd(couponAmount,orderRecord[tokenUser[1]][orderHash].longBalance[msg.sender])) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no
        potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call contains the '.transfer(' keyword, so it satisfies the condition.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - Token(tokenUser[0]).transfer(msg.sender,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['Token(tokenUser[0]).transfer(msg.sender,amount)']
    Analyze External Address
        The variable 'tokenUser' in external call 'Token(tokenUser[0]).transfer(msg.sender,amount)' has no state variable assigned in
        ShortOrder.exerciseLong(address[2],uint256[8],uint8,bytes32[2]). Therefore we check whether it has been hardcoded in the function.
            No In the provided function, the variable 'tokenUser' is used dynamically. It is passed as an argument to the function 'exerciseLong'. The function uses it in
            operations like hashing and transferring tokens, but it doesn't contain any hardcoded instances of 'tokenUser'. The function logic relies on the value passed
            to 'tokenUser' at the time of the function call, rather than a fixed value within the function. Therefore, 'tokenUser' is not hardcoded.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
