Function Security Analysis for VestingContractWTTEST.transfer(address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function transfer.
    Check direct function security
        - function VestingContractWTTEST.transfer(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any check or logic that specifically involves msg.sender being compared or certain roles being checked using require, if, or
          assert statements as described in the characteristics. It only has general requirements on token balance and transfer limits.
        - function VestingContractWTTEST.transfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: None of the specified structures with 'require' or 'if' and an update to the same variable exist in the code.

    Remaining external call: ['we_test_token.transfer(to,value)', 'we_test_token.balanceOf(this)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['we_test_token'] should be checked in variable we_test_token
        Checked variables: we_test_token
            Yes The function name 'VestingContractWTTEST' matches the contract name, indicating that this function is a constructor. Constructors in Solidity are
            functions whose names match the contract's name and are executed once at the time of contract creation.
        There are ['we_test_token'] should be checked in variable we_test_token
        Checked variables: we_test_token
            Yes 1. The function name, VestingContractWTTEST, matches the contract name, indicating that this function is a constructor. Thus, it satisfies the first
            characteristic.   2. The state variable 'we_test_token' is used in the assignment "we_test_token = _we_test_token;", but there is no hardcoded value. It takes
            a parameter as opposed to a hardcoded value, so it does not satisfy the second characteristic related to hardcoded state variables.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
