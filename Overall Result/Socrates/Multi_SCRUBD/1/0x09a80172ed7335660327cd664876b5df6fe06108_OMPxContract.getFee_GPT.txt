Function Security Analysis for OMPxContract.getFee()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function getFee.
    Check direct function security
        - function OMPxContract.getFee() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not check the identity of the msg.sender against any special owner or address role like Owner/Address/Leader/CEO. Its logic only
          involves transferring funds and checking a balance.
        - function OMPxContract.getFee() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any 'require' statement nor a 'throw' statement, thus it doesn't match any of the specified structures.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['feeReceiverContract.receiveFunds.value(feeBalance).gas(150000)()']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - The gas limit in feeReceiverContract.receiveFunds.value(feeBalance).gas(150000)() is 150000, which is too high. Therefore, it will not prevent REE problem.
    Remaining external call: ['feeReceiverContract.receiveFunds.value(feeBalance).gas(150000)()']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['feeReceiverContract'] should be checked in variable feeReceiverContract
        Checked variables: feeReceiverContract
            No The function name 'setFeeReceiver' does not match the contract name 'OMPxContract', nor is it named 'constructor'. Additionally, the function does not
            hardcode the state variable 'feeReceiverContract'; instead, it assigns it based on an input parameter 'newReceiver'.
            Function Security Analysis for OMPxContract.setFeeReceiver(address)
                The modifier of function setFeeReceiver are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The analysis of the code confirms that the modifier checks if 'msg.sender' is equal to 'owner' using the condition 'require(msg.sender ==
                      owner);'. This line alone is sufficient to enforce that only the owner can execute the function, which aligns with characteristic 1. There are no
                      structural omissions in the judgment based on this condition.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
