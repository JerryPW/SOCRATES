Function Security Analysis for WithdrawContract.withdraw()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function withdraw.
    Check direct function security
        - function WithdrawContract.withdraw() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any checks that involve comparing `msg.sender` with an owner or authorized role directly (such as
          xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO). It primarily focuses on processing deposits and managing tokens.
        - function WithdrawContract.withdraw() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code contains statements that check a condition with 'require', such as 'require(i<deposits.length)' and 'require(msg.gas>149000)', but none of
          these match the specific patterns outlined in the characteristics. There is no pattern where the same variable is checked with 'require' and then assigned
          'True' or 'False' as per the structures provided. Thus, none of the required structures are present.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['rewardToken.totalSupplyAt(d.block)', 'rewardToken.balanceOfAt(msg.sender,d.block)']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - rewardToken.totalSupplyAt(d.block) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - rewardToken.balanceOfAt(msg.sender,d.block) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['rewardToken.totalSupplyAt(d.block)', 'rewardToken.balanceOfAt(msg.sender,d.block)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['rewardToken'] should be checked in variable rewardToken
        Checked variables: rewardToken
            Yes The function name 'WithdrawContract' matches the contract name and can be identified as a constructor. The function is setting the state variable
            'rewardToken' with a parameter '_rewardToken', not a hardcoded value.
        There are ['rewardToken'] should be checked in variable rewardToken
        Checked variables: rewardToken
            Yes The function name is 'WithdrawContract', which matches the contract name, indicating that this is a constructor. Constructors are special functions in
            smart contracts used to initialize the contract's state variables when the contract is deployed. Thus, the external call satisfies the first characteristic.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Function Security Analysis for WithdrawContract.doPayment(uint256,address,ERC20,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function doPayment.
    Check direct function security
        - function WithdrawContract.doPayment(uint256,address,ERC20,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any checks or assertions on `msg.sender` against an owner or address like xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO as specified in the
          characteristics.
        - function WithdrawContract.doPayment(uint256,address,ERC20,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures like 'require(xxx == True)' followed by 'xxx = False', 'require(xxx == False)' followed by
          'xxx = True', 'require(!xxx)' followed by 'xxx = True', or 'if(!xxx) throw' followed by 'xxx = true'. It uses conditional checks and returns but not in the
          manner specified.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['withdraw']
        Function Security Analysis for WithdrawContract.withdraw()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function withdraw.
            Check direct function security
                - function WithdrawContract.withdraw() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified patterns involving `msg.sender` checks against owner or special address variables like
                  xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO.
                - function WithdrawContract.withdraw() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The given code does not follow any of the predefined structures because none of the require statements and variable assignments match the
                  patterns specified (such as changing a variable from true to false or false to true). The requires are followed by logical conditions but not
                  assignments that directly flip the state of a boolean variable.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['_token.transfer(_dest,_amount)', '_dest.send(_amount)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - _token.transfer(_dest,_amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - _dest.send(_amount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the '.send(' keyword,
        which means it satisfies the second characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - _token.transfer(_dest,_amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['_token.transfer(_dest,_amount)']
    Analyze External Address
        The variable '_token' in external call '_token.transfer(_dest,_amount)' has no state variable assigned in
        WithdrawContract.doPayment(uint256,address,ERC20,uint256). Considering that it is an internal/private function, we analyze the function inputs.
        Analyze External Address
            There are ['deposits'] should be checked in variable currentToken
            Checked variables: deposits
                No The code contains functions such as 'newEtherDeposit', 'newTokenDeposit', and 'cancelPaymentGlobally'. None of these function names matches the
                contract name 'WithdrawContract', nor is there a function explicitly named 'constructor'. Therefore, none of these functions is a constructor.
                Additionally, the functions interact with the state variable 'deposits', but this interaction is through dynamic operations like appending new deposits or
                setting a status; none of these operations involve hardcoding a fixed value into 'deposits'. The checks and assignments depend on external input and
                current ledger state rather than hardcoded static assignments.  Thus, none of these functions satisfy either characteristic needed to answer 'Yes'.
            Function Security Analysis for WithdrawContract.newEtherDeposit(uint256)
                The modifier of function newEtherDeposit are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The code contains a statement 'require (msg.sender == owner);' which ensures only the owner can execute the function. This satisfies rule 1,
                      as it explicitly checks that msg.sender equals owner, indicating enforcement of ownership control.
            Function Security Analysis for WithdrawContract.newTokenDeposit(ERC20,uint256,uint256)
                The modifier of function newTokenDeposit are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: Upon reevaluation, the modifier 'onlyOwner' includes the statement 'require(msg.sender == owner);' which clearly satisfies characteristic 1,
                      enforcing that only the owner can execute the function. There are no structural omissions as this statement directly corresponds to the first
                      characteristic for owner verification. There is no indication here of a lock mechanism as described in characteristic 2. Therefore, based on the
                      first characteristic, the initial judgment remains validated.
            Function Security Analysis for WithdrawContract.cancelPaymentGlobally(uint256)
                The modifier of function cancelPaymentGlobally are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: Rule 1: The modifier 'onlyOwner' enforces that only the owner can execute the function, as it contains the statement 'require(msg.sender ==
                      owner)', confirming msg.sender must be the owner. There are no structural omissions since the check directly follows Rule 1.
            There are ['deposits'] should be checked in variable currentToken
            Checked variables: deposits
                No Upon analyzing the provided functions, none of them appear to meet the criteria for the specified characteristics. First, none of these functions are
                named "WithdrawContract" or "constructor", so they are not constructors. Second, none of the functions set the given state variable `deposits` with a
                hardcoded value; they conditionally modify or append to `deposits` based on inputs, but do not have hardcoded values for `deposits`.
            Function Security Analysis for WithdrawContract.newEtherDeposit(uint256)
                The modifier of function newEtherDeposit are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: Rule 1: The modifier enforces that only the owner can execute the function using 'require(msg.sender == owner);'. This matches the pattern
                      indicated in Rule 1.
            Function Security Analysis for WithdrawContract.newTokenDeposit(ERC20,uint256,uint256)
                The modifier of function newTokenDeposit are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The code contains 'require(msg.sender == owner)', which enforces that only the owner can execute the function. This matches characteristic 1
                      of checking for owner or specific addresses. There are no indications of a lock and unlock operation related to characteristic 2. Thus, the original
                      judgment remains unchanged.
            Function Security Analysis for WithdrawContract.cancelPaymentGlobally(uint256)
                The modifier of function cancelPaymentGlobally are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The modifier explicitly uses 'require(msg.sender == owner);' which satisfies rule 1, confirming that the function enforces only the owner
                      can execute it. There is no structural omission as this requirement directly aligns with one of the characteristics to output 'Yes'.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
