Function Security Analysis for xSNXCore.mintWithSnx(uint256)
    The modifier of function mintWithSnx are ['whenNotPaused']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier whenNotPaused has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The code in the modifier checks whether the contract is paused, but it does not explicitly enforce that only the owner or specific addresses can run the
          function, nor does it use a flag as a lock operation to ensure the function enters only once. However, it doesn't match with clear indicators like Onlyxxx or
          nonReentrant.
    Check direct function security
        - function xSNXCore.mintWithSnx(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures related to `msg.sender` checking against an xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
        - function xSNXCore.mintWithSnx(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not contain any of the specified structures. It only includes a 'require' statement to check if a condition (snxAmount > 0) is met,
          but it lacks any variable assignment after the 'require' that fits the required patterns or behavior.

    Analyze Gas
        - IERC20(snxAddress).transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),snxAmount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['IERC20(snxAddress).transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),snxAmount)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['snxAddress'] should be checked in variable snxAddress
        Checked variables: snxAddress
            Yes The code provided is a constructor function, as indicated by the use of the keyword 'constructor'. The function initializes several state variables,
            including the 'snxAddress' which is passed as a parameter. However, 'snxAddress' is not hardcoded in the function; it is assigned the value of '_snxAddress',
            which is an input parameter. Therefore, it does not meet the second characteristic. Nevertheless, it meets the first characteristic of being a constructor, so
            it satisfies the conditions.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
