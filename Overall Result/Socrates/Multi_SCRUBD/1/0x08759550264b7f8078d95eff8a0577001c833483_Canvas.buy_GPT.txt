Function Security Analysis for Canvas.buy()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function buy.
    Check direct function security
        - function Canvas.buy() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not use msg.sender in the context required by the specified structures.
        - function Canvas.buy() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not utilize a variable in the specific require or if structure described by the characteristics. The conditions mentioned involve toggling
          a boolean variable or using it in a thrown or reverted context, but this code checks if 'msg.value' is equal to 'price' without modifying any boolean variable
          in continuation, hence does not meet any of the characteristics.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['hodler.call{gas:20000,value:hodler_share}()']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - The gas limit in hodler.call{gas:20000,value:hodler_share}() is 20000, which is too high. Therefore, it will not prevent REE problem.
    Remaining external call: ['hodler.call{gas:20000,value:hodler_share}()']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['hodler'] should be checked in variable hodler
        Checked variables: hodler
            Yes The given function '_transferBase' is neither a constructor function nor does it have the same name as the contract 'Canvas'. Therefore, it does not
            satisfy condition 1. However, the function uses 'hodler', the provided state variable, within its logic. The state variable 'hodler' is updated/hardcoded with
            the new address 'to'. Thus, it satisfies condition 2.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
