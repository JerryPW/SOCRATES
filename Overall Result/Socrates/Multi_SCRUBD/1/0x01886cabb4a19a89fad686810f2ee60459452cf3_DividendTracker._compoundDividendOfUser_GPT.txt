        - function DividendTracker._compoundDividendOfUser(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures that check or assert the identity of `msg.sender`. It primarily deals with dividend withdrawal
          and token purchasing processes.
        - function DividendTracker._compoundDividendOfUser(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.

            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The code contains a require statement: `require(owner() == _msgSender(), "Ownable: caller is not the owner");` which enforces that only the
                  owner can execute the function. This matches with rule 1, as it checks if the msg.sender is the owner, ensuring that the function can only be called by
                  the owner. There is no evidence of a lock mechanism which would match rule 2.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
