    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _transfer.
    Check direct function security
        - function RAGE._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures that check or assert the equivalence of msg.sender with any specific owner or leader address.
        - function RAGE._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code provided does not contain any of the specified structures. The require statement checks if the balance is greater than or equal to the amount,
          and there is no subsequent assignment of the same variable to True or False. Furthermore, the logic presented does not attempt to alter the state of a boolean
          variable after a require statement or within an if-throw structure, as described in the patterns.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transfer', 'transferFrom']
        Function Security Analysis for RAGE.transfer(address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transfer.
            Check direct function security
                - function RAGE.transfer(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not include any conditional logic or assertions related to 'msg.sender'.
                - function RAGE.transfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures.

Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: RAGE.swapTokenForETH(uint256)
Function Security Analysis for RAGE.swapTokenForETH(uint256)
    The modifier of function swapTokenForETH are ['lockTheSwap']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier lockTheSwap is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The modifier 'lockTheSwap' sets the 'inSwap' flag to true before the function runs and resets it to false afterward. This demonstrates a lock operation
          to ensure the function can enter only once, satisfying the second characteristic.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
