    Check direct function security
        - function TrustlessOTC.cancelTrade(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code uses 'require(msg.sender == o.creator)' to ensure that the function can only be executed by the creator of the trade offer, but the check is
          against a local structure's (o) property, which does not match the required global role-based address checks specified in the rules.
        - function TrustlessOTC.cancelTrade(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function does not include any of the required statement structures, such as 'require(xxx == True); xxx = False;', or 'require(xxx == False); xxx =
          True;', or 'require(!xxx); xxx = True;', or 'if(!xxx) throw; xxx = true;'. The structure of the function mainly utilizes 'require' for permission checking and
          does not set any variables to True or False after a require statement.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['msg.sender.transfer(o.amountFrom)', 'TokenNoReturn(o.tokenFrom).transfer(o.creator,o.amountFrom)',
    'Token(o.tokenFrom).transfer(o.creator,o.amountFrom)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - msg.sender.transfer(o.amountFrom) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call contains '.transfer('
        keyword, satisfying the first characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - TokenNoReturn(o.tokenFrom).transfer(o.creator,o.amountFrom) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - Token(o.tokenFrom).transfer(o.creator,o.amountFrom) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - TokenNoReturn(o.tokenFrom).transfer(o.creator,o.amountFrom) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - Token(o.tokenFrom).transfer(o.creator,o.amountFrom) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['TokenNoReturn(o.tokenFrom).transfer(o.creator,o.amountFrom)', 'Token(o.tokenFrom).transfer(o.creator,o.amountFrom)']
    Analyze External Address
        The variable 'o' in external call 'TokenNoReturn(o.tokenFrom).transfer(o.creator,o.amountFrom)' has no state variable assigned in
        TrustlessOTC.cancelTrade(uint256). Therefore we check whether it has been hardcoded in the function.
            No The variable 'o' is not hardcoded in the function. It is assigned a value from the 'offers' array using the 'tradeID' parameter.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
