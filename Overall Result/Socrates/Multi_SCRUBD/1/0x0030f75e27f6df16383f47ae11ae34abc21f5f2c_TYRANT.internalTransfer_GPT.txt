Function Security Analysis for TYRANT.internalTransfer(address,address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function internalTransfer.
    Check direct function security
        - function TYRANT.internalTransfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures that involve msg.sender, such as checks or assertions directly related to an owner, address,
          or leader/CEO.
        - function TYRANT.internalTransfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures. It includes various checks and conditional modifications of certain variables but does not
          exhibit the specific requirement and assignment pattern defined in the characteristics. None of the conditions involve a consistent variable being required to
          be true or false, then assigned the opposite value within both required and assigned steps.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['withdrawStuckTokens', 'manualBurnTokensFromLP', 'transfer', 'AirDrop', 'transferFrom']
        Function Security Analysis for TYRANT.withdrawStuckTokens(uint256)
            The modifier of function withdrawStuckTokens are ['onlyOwner']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The modifier contains a require statement "require(owner() == _msgSender(), ...)" that checks if the message sender is the owner, thus
                  fulfilling the condition of Rule 1 which checks for owner-only execution.
        Function Security Analysis for TYRANT.manualBurnTokensFromLP(uint256)
            The modifier of function manualBurnTokensFromLP are ['onlyOwner']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The code in the modifier contains the statement 'require(owner() == _msgSender(), "ERC20Ownable: caller is not the owner")', which checks if the
                  caller is the owner before allowing execution. This matches rule 1 of the characteristics required for the answer 'Yes'. Therefore, the previous
                  judgment was not blindly made and is verified as correct.
        Function Security Analysis for TYRANT.transfer(address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transfer.
            Check direct function security
                - function TYRANT.transfer(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The provided code does not have any checks involving msg.sender with conditions on specific roles like owner, leader, CEO, etc., as described.
                - function TYRANT.transfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures. It only has a function definition with a call to 'internalTransfer' and
                  returns true, which does not match the required patterns.

Start analyze function: TYRANT.taxTokenSwap()
Function Security Analysis for TYRANT.taxTokenSwap()
    The modifier of function taxTokenSwap are ['lockTheSwap']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier lockTheSwap is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The modifier 'lockTheSwap' sets the variable 'inSwapAndLiquify' to true before executing the main function body and resets it to false afterwards,
          forming a lock operation. This satisfies characteristic 2: Use of lock operation.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
