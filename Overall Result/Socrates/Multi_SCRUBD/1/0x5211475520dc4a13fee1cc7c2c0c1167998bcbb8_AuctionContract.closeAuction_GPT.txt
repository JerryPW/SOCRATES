Function Security Analysis for AuctionContract.closeAuction()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function closeAuction.
    Check direct function security
        - function AuctionContract.closeAuction() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: Although the code contains 'assert(msg.sender == winner);', the term 'winner' does not follow the specified naming pattern
          'xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO'. Therefore, the structure doesn't match the given criteria based on the naming convention.
        - function AuctionContract.closeAuction() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon re-evaluating the given code, it is identified that the structure does not exactly match any of the required patterns. It contains the statement
          'assert(isActive);' but it is followed by setting 'isActive = false;', not 'isActive = True'. Thus, it does not fulfill structures 1 or 2 because the first two
          statements of those structures are missing. The presence of 'assert(isActive);' without a subsequent variable change to true negates structure 1. Only having
          the assert statement on a variable does not meet the requirement of any pattern.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['auctioneer.createAuctionContract.value(firstValue)()', 'auctioneer.createAuctionContract.value(secondValue)()', 'msg.sender.transfer(prize)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - msg.sender.transfer(prize) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains '.transfer('
        keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - auctioneer.createAuctionContract.value(firstValue)() ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - auctioneer.createAuctionContract.value(secondValue)() ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['auctioneer.createAuctionContract.value(firstValue)()', 'auctioneer.createAuctionContract.value(secondValue)()']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['auctioneerAddress'] should be checked in variable auctioneer
        Checked variables: auctioneerAddress
            Yes The provided code is clearly a constructor because the function name is explicitly 'constructor'.
        There are ['auctioneerAddress'] should be checked in variable auctioneer
        Checked variables: auctioneerAddress
            Yes The provided code contains a constructor for the `AuctionContract`. This is determined because the function is explicitly named 'constructor', satisfying
            the first characteristic.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
