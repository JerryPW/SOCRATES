Function Security Analysis for CompliantCrowdsaleHardcap._approveMint(uint256)
    The modifier of function _approveMint are ['checkIsInvestorApproved']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier checkIsInvestorApproved has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier uses a function `isInvestorApproved` from a contract `whiteListingContract` to check if the investor is approved. This doesn't enforce
          owner-specific control or locking mechanisms explicitly, nor does it have a function name that clearly suggests such operations.
    Check direct function security
        - function CompliantCrowdsaleHardcap._approveMint(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: None of the specified structures related to msg.sender authority checks are present in the provided function code.
        - function CompliantCrowdsaleHardcap._approveMint(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not match any of the specified structures. It lacks any sort of conditional checks or flips on boolean variables as described in the
          structures (1) through (4).
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['approveMint', 'bulkApproveMints']
        Function Security Analysis for CompliantCrowdsaleHardcap.approveMint(uint256)
            The modifier of function approveMint are ['onlyValidator']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyValidator is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: Upon reviewing the code, it is confirmed that the statement 'require(msg.sender == validator);' enforces that only the validator can execute the
                  function, satisfying characteristic 1. There are no omissions related to locking mechanisms as characteristic 2 is not applicable here.
        Function Security Analysis for CompliantCrowdsaleHardcap.bulkApproveMints(uint256[])
            The modifier of function bulkApproveMints are ['onlyValidator']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyValidator is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: Upon reviewing the code, the modifier onlyValidator contains the statement require(msg.sender == validator);, which satisfies characteristic 1
                  as it restricts execution of the function to a specific address stored in validator.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
