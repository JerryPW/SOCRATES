    Check direct function security
        - function MonkeyScam.endRound(LDdatasets.EventReturns) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not use any conditional checks involving `msg.sender` to determine ownership or authority as specified in the guidelines provided.
        - function MonkeyScam.endRound(LDdatasets.EventReturns) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures where a variable is explicitly set to true or false accompanied by a require(!xxx) or
          if(!xxx) statement. It is primarily dealing with arithmetic and function calls without fulfilling the pattern requirements.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

        Function Security Analysis for MonkeyScam.withdraw()
            The modifier of function withdraw are ['isActivated', 'isHuman']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier isActivated has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier does not satisfy any of the given characteristics. It checks a state variable 'activated_' but doesn't check for ownership or use
                  lock operations nor does the name suggest so.
                - modifier isHuman has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier isHuman checks whether the caller is a contract or not using the extcodesize of the sender's address. It does not restrict the
                  function only to specific addresses like an owner or specific person (Rule 1), nor does it use a lock mechanism (Rule 2). It does not have a name
                  indicating it infers either rule, such as Onlyxxx or nonReentrant (Rule 3). Therefore, none of the rules are satisfied.
            Check direct function security
                - function MonkeyScam.withdraw() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The given code does not contain any of the specific structures mentioned: require, if conditions checking msg.sender, throw, or assert with
                  msg.sender check against any owners, addresses, or roles like Leader/CEO.
                - function MonkeyScam.withdraw() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code doesn't contain the required structures specified in the question prompt.
