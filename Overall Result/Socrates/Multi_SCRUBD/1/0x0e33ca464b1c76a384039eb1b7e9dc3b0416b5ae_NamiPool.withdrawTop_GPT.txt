    Check direct function security
        - function NamiPool.withdrawTop(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The given function has no condition that checks the equality or inequality of msg.sender with xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
        - function NamiPool.withdrawTop(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: In the function `withdrawTop`, the statement `require(namiPool[_roundIndex][msg.sender].isWithdrawn == false);` checks the state of
          `namiPool[_roundIndex][msg.sender].isWithdrawn`. The corresponding negation, `namiPool[_roundIndex][msg.sender].isWithdrawn = true;`, happens after several
          other operations, including calculations and a transfer. Hence, this does not immediately perform a state negation operation after the state check. Therefore,
          the structure does not meet the specified requirement.
