Function Security Analysis for BoomerangLiquidity.payout()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function payout.
    Check direct function security
        - function BoomerangLiquidity.payout() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not include any of the specified structures that check whether msg.sender is equal to a specific owner or address role like xxxOwner,
          xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO.
        - function BoomerangLiquidity.payout() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code snippet does not contain a require statement that directly checks if a boolean variable is either True or False, nor does it throw an
          exception based on a condition involving a boolean variable. The require statement in the code is checking if the balance is greater than 1, which doesn't match
          any of the specified patterns of checking a boolean variable.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.send(payoutToSend)', 'flmContract.call.value(investment).gas(1000000)()',
    'participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.call.value(payoutToSend).gas(1000000)()']
    Analyze Transfer
        - participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.send(payoutToSend) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The
        external call contains '.send(' keyword, thus it satisfies the characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - The gas limit in flmContract.call.value(investment).gas(1000000)() is 1000000, which is too high. Therefore, it will not prevent REE problem.
        - The gas limit in participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.call.value(payoutToSend).gas(1000000)() is 1000000, which is too high. Therefore, it will not prevent
        REE problem.
    Remaining external call: ['flmContract.call.value(investment).gas(1000000)()', 'participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.call.value(payoutToSend).gas(1000000)()']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['flmContract'] should be checked in variable flmContract
        Checked variables: flmContract
            Yes The function name 'BoomerangLiquidity' matches the contract name 'BoomerangLiquidity', indicating that this is a constructor. Constructors are executed
            once when the contract is deployed. Therefore, the external call satisfies the first characteristic.
        There are ['participants'] should be checked in variable participants
        Checked variables: participants
            No The provided smart contract code consists of two functions: 'deposit' and 'payout'. The contract's name is BoomerangLiquidity, but neither of these
            functions is named BoomerangLiquidity or constructor, so they do not qualify as a constructor. Additionally, neither function contains a hardcoded reference
            to the state variable 'participants'. The state variable 'participants' is used within the 'deposit' function, but not in a hardcoded way, as it is
            dynamically updated with the sender address and value. Therefore, the code does not satisfy either characteristic.
            Function Security Analysis for BoomerangLiquidity.deposit()
                There are no modifiers should be examined in function deposit.
                Check direct function security
                    - function BoomerangLiquidity.deposit() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                      Reason: The code lacks any access control mechanisms related to the caller's address, such as checks involving msg.sender with roles like Owner,
                      Leader, etc.
                    - function BoomerangLiquidity.deposit() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                      Reason: The code does not mention any of the defined structures, like 'require', 'if', or setting the same variable first to true and then false, or
                      vice versa.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
