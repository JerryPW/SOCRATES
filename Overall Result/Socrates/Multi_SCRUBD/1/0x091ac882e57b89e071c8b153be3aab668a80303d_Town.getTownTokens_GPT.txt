Function Security Analysis for Town.getTownTokens(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function getTownTokens.
    Check direct function security
        - function Town.getTownTokens(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any checks against msg.sender for specific owners or roles as specified.
        - function Town.getTownTokens(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given function doesn't contain any of the specified structures, such as require with a boolean condition on a variable, followed by a state change
          to that variable.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['msg.sender.transfer(change)', '_remunerationsQueue[i_scope_1]._address.transfer(_remunerationsQueue[i_scope_1]._amount)',
    '_token.transfer(holder,tokenBalance)', '_remunerationsQueue[i]._address.transfer(amount)', '_remunerationsQueue[i_scope_1]._address.transfer(amount)',
    '_token.transfer(holder,tokenAmount)', '_remunerationsQueue[i]._address.transfer(_remunerationsQueue[i]._amount)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - msg.sender.transfer(change) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains '.transfer(',
        which matches the condition for the characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - _remunerationsQueue[i_scope_1]._address.transfer(_remunerationsQueue[i_scope_1]._amount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem.
        Here is the reason: The external call contains '.transfer(', which matches the condition for the characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - _token.transfer(holder,tokenBalance) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - _remunerationsQueue[i]._address.transfer(amount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        contains '.transfer(', which matches the condition for the characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - _remunerationsQueue[i_scope_1]._address.transfer(amount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The
        external call contains '.transfer(', which matches the condition for the characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - _token.transfer(holder,tokenAmount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - _remunerationsQueue[i]._address.transfer(_remunerationsQueue[i]._amount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the
        reason: The external call contains '.transfer(', which matches the condition for the characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - _token.transfer(holder,tokenBalance) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - _token.transfer(holder,tokenAmount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['_token.transfer(holder,tokenBalance)', '_token.transfer(holder,tokenAmount)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['_token'] should be checked in variable _token
        Checked variables: _token
            Yes The provided smart contract code is a constructor, as evident from the function explicitly named 'constructor'. Constructors in Solidity are not named
            after the contract name as they were in older versions, but instead are declared with the 'constructor' keyword. This satisfies the first characteristic of
            the external call function.
        There are ['_token'] should be checked in variable _token
        Checked variables: _token
            Yes The provided code contains a constructor function, which is explicitly named 'constructor'. It initializes the contract with various parameters, including
            hardcoded settings, but not specifically the '_token'. However, the presence of the constructor satisfies the first characteristic requirement regardless of
            whether the state variable '_token' is hardcoded or not.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
