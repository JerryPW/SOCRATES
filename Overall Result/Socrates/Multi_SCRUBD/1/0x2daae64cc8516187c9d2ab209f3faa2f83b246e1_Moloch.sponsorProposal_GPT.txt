Function Security Analysis for Moloch.sponsorProposal(uint256)
    The modifier of function sponsorProposal are ['nonReentrant', 'onlyDelegate']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier nonReentrant is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The code within the modifier indicates a lock operation. The following operations confirm rule 2:  1. The modifier checks `_status != _ENTERED` to
          ensure the modifier is not already active, suggesting an initial lock check. 2. It then sets `_status = _ENTERED` before the function runs to establish the
          lock. 3. The lock is reset after the execution with `_status = _NOT_ENTERED`.  This structure clearly demonstrates both a lock and unlock operation in
          accordance with rule 2.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
