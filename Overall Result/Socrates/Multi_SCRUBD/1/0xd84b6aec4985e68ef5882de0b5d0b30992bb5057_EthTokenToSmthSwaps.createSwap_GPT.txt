    Analyze External Address
        The variable '_token' in external call 'ERC20(_token).transferFrom(msg.sender,this,_value)' has no state variable assigned in
        EthTokenToSmthSwaps.createSwap(bytes20,address,uint256,address). Therefore we check whether it has been hardcoded in the function.
            No The variable '_token' is used as a parameter in the function and is passed by the caller when the function is invoked. There is no specific value assigned
            to '_token' within the function itself, indicating that it is not hardcoded.
