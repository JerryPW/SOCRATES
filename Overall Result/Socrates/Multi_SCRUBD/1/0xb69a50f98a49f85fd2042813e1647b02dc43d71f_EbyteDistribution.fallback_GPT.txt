Start analyze function: EbyteDistribution.fallback()
Function Security Analysis for EbyteDistribution.fallback()
    The modifier of function fallback are ['onlyWhitelist', 'isUnlocked']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier onlyWhitelist has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier onlyWhitelist() checks if the message sender is not in a blacklist. However, this does not fit any of the characteristics provided, as it
          does not enforce ownership or use a lock operation.
        - modifier isUnlocked has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The code only contains a check if the contract is unlocked (require(!contractLocked)), but does not show any setting or resetting of the lock,
          suggesting there is no complete lock operation. Hence, items 2 and 3 are not fully satisfied. There is no explicit indication of owner-based access control
          either.
    Check direct function security
        - function EbyteDistribution.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any msg.sender validation against a specific owner or leader variable, nor does it use require, if, or assert for such
          checks.
        - function EbyteDistribution.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any require statements or if conditions specified in the defined patterns. It provides some operations with functions and
          token transfers but lacks any of the conditional actions required
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['ebyteToken.transfer(investor,toGiveE)', 'ebyteToken.transfer(investor,toGiveT)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - ebyteToken.transfer(investor,toGiveE) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - ebyteToken.transfer(investor,toGiveT) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - ebyteToken.transfer(investor,toGiveE) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - ebyteToken.transfer(investor,toGiveT) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['ebyteToken.transfer(investor,toGiveE)', 'ebyteToken.transfer(investor,toGiveT)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['ebyteToken'] should be checked in variable ebyteToken
        Checked variables: ebyteToken
            Yes The provided code snippet is a constructor for the EbyteDistribution contract. The function name matches the contract name 'EbyteDistribution', which
            indicates that it is indeed a constructor. Constructors generally set initial values of state variables, which this code does by initializing 'ebyteToken'
            with '_tokenAddress'. However, the state variable 'ebyteToken' itself does not contain a hardcoded value here, as it is being set dynamically based on the
            input argument '_tokenAddress'.  Thus, it satisfies the first characteristic, which is being a constructor.
        There are ['ebyteToken'] should be checked in variable ebyteToken
        Checked variables: ebyteToken
            Yes The function 'EbyteDistribution' matches the contract name 'EbyteDistribution', indicating that this is likely a constructor. Typically, in older versions
            of Solidity, a constructor shares its name with the contract.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: EbyteDistribution.getTokenBalance(address)
Function Security Analysis for EbyteDistribution.getTokenBalance(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function getTokenBalance.
    Check direct function security
        - function EbyteDistribution.getTokenBalance(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not have any checks or conditional statements involving msg.sender related to access control for a specific owner or leader role.
        - function EbyteDistribution.getTokenBalance(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures such as 'require(xxx == True); xxx = False;' or similar structures mentioned in the rules.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['ebyteToken.balanceOf(who)']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - ebyteToken.balanceOf(who) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['ebyteToken.balanceOf(who)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['ebyteToken'] should be checked in variable ebyteToken
        Checked variables: ebyteToken
            Yes The function name matches the contract name 'EbyteDistribution', making it a constructor under older Solidity versions.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
