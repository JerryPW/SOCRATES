Function Security Analysis for Crowdsale.fallback()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
    Check direct function security
        - function Crowdsale.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The given code checks for the condition require(!crowdsaleClosed) and does not involve any condition checking msg.sender against an owner, address, or
          role such as xxxOwner or Leader. Therefore it does not satisfy any of the outlined structures.
        - function Crowdsale.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon reviewing the code, the structure 'require(!crowdsaleClosed)' matches part of one of the provided patterns; however, the subsequent line
          'crowdsaleClosed = True;' or a similar control modification statement is not present. Therefore, it lacks the necessary second component of the structure, where
          'crowdsaleClosed' is set to 'True'. This prevents the code from fully matching any of the specified structural patterns, as both conditions are required for the
          patterns to be recognized.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,amount*10000)', 'beneficiary.send(amount)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,amount*10000) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - beneficiary.send(amount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        'beneficiary.send(amount)' contains the '.send(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,amount*10000) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,amount*10000)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['tokenReward'] should be checked in variable tokenReward
        Checked variables: tokenReward
            Yes 1. The function name 'Crowdsale' matches the contract name, indicating that it is a constructor. 2. The state variable 'tokenReward' is being assigned
            using the passed parameter 'addressOfTokenUsedAsReward' rather than being hardcoded, so it doesn't satisfy the second characteristic.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
