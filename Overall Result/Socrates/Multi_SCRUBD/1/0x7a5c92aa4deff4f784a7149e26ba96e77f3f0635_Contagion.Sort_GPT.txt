Function Security Analysis for Contagion.Sort()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function Sort.
    Check direct function security
        - function Contagion.Sort() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not include any require or assert statements that involve checking msg.sender against any specific owner or address variable like
          xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, CEO.
        - function Contagion.Sort() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function `Sort` does not contain any `require` statement or `if` statement with a `throw`. Additionally, it does not set a boolean variable to both
          `True` and `False` within the specified structures. Thus, it doesn't match any of the given structures.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['fallback']
        Function Security Analysis for Contagion.fallback()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
            Check direct function security
                - function Contagion.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function uses a require statement, but it does not involve checking msg.sender against an owner or leader address.
                - function Contagion.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures involving the same variable being checked by a require statement with specific
                  conditions (i.e., 'xxx == True', 'xxx == False', '!xxx') followed by setting the same variable to True or False.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['owner.send(feecounter)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - owner.send(feecounter) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the '.send('
        keyword, which satisfies one of the characteristics specified.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
