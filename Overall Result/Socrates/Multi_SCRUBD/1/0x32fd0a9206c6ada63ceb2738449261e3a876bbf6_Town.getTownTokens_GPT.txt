Function Security Analysis for Town.getTownTokens(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function getTownTokens.
    Check direct function security
        - function Town.getTownTokens(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any checks on msg.sender against a specific owner, address, leader, or CEO as part of its logic.
        - function Town.getTownTokens(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not match any of the four specified structures. There is a require statement, but it does not check if a boolean variable is true or false
          in the required way, nor is there a variable that is set to true or false following the require statement.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['msg.sender.transfer(change)', '_remunerationsQueue[i_scope_1]._address.transfer(_remunerationsQueue[i_scope_1]._amount)',
    '_token.transfer(holder,tokenBalance)', '_remunerationsQueue[i]._address.transfer(amount)', '_remunerationsQueue[i_scope_1]._address.transfer(amount)',
    '_token.transfer(holder,tokenAmount)', '_remunerationsQueue[i]._address.transfer(_remunerationsQueue[i]._amount)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - msg.sender.transfer(change) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains '.transfer('
        keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - _remunerationsQueue[i_scope_1]._address.transfer(_remunerationsQueue[i_scope_1]._amount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem.
        Here is the reason: The external call contains '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - _token.transfer(holder,tokenBalance) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - _remunerationsQueue[i]._address.transfer(amount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        contains '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - _remunerationsQueue[i_scope_1]._address.transfer(amount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The
        external call contains '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - _token.transfer(holder,tokenAmount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - _remunerationsQueue[i]._address.transfer(_remunerationsQueue[i]._amount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the
        reason: The external call contains '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - _token.transfer(holder,tokenBalance) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - _token.transfer(holder,tokenAmount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['_token.transfer(holder,tokenBalance)', '_token.transfer(holder,tokenAmount)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['_token'] should be checked in variable _token
        Checked variables: _token
            Yes The provided code is a constructor for the contract named 'Town'. This is because the function is explicitly named 'constructor', which is a standard way
            to declare a constructor in Solidity, and does not require the function name to match the contract name in modern Solidity versions.
        There are ['_token'] should be checked in variable _token
        Checked variables: _token
            Yes 1. The function in the provided code is explicitly named 'constructor', which indicates it is a constructor function. 2. The constructor function assigns
            a state variable '_token'. However, '_token' is not hardcoded in the function as it takes 'tokenAddress' as a parameter.  Thus, the function satisfies
            characteristic 1 but not characteristic 2.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
