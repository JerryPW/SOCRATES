    There are no modifiers should be examined in function process.
    Check direct function security
        - function PunkMonkeyDividendTracker.process(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain msg.sender comparisons with any specific owner/leader role or address for permission checks.
        - function PunkMonkeyDividendTracker.process(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not contain any of the required structures. It does not use a 'require' statement or an 'if' statement with 'throw', and it does not
          have the specific pattern of assigning a boolean variable as described in any of the four structures provided. The code primarily checks and processes claims
          for token holders based on remaining gas and an exclusion list without explicitly requiring any of the described structures.

Function Security Analysis for PunkMonkeyDividendTracker.processAccount(address,bool)
    The modifier of function processAccount are ['onlyOwner']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The code in the modifier onlyOwner contains the statement 'require(_owner == _msgSender(), "Ownable: caller is not the owner");', which checks that the
          caller is the owner. This satisfies characteristic 1 as it enforces execution by the owner. Since there is no indication of lock and unlock operations in the
          code, characteristic 2 does not apply. The initial judgment was based on characteristic 1 and is correct.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
