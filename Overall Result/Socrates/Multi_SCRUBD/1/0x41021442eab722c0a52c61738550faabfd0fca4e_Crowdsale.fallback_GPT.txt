Function Security Analysis for Crowdsale.fallback()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
    Check direct function security
        - function Crowdsale.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not include any require, if, or assert statements that check for the sender's address against a predefined owner-like address.
        - function Crowdsale.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function checks if the crowdsale is closed using 'require(!crowdsaleClosed && msg.value >= 1 ether)'. It has the structure where 'require(!xxx)' is
          present, but it does not set 'crowdsaleClosed = True' after the check within the function, which is required by the pattern 3 or 4. Therefore, none of the
          defined structures are fully matched.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['beneficiary.send(amount)', 'tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,sendTokens)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - beneficiary.send(amount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        'beneficiary.send(amount)' contains the keyword '.send('.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,sendTokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,sendTokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,sendTokens)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['tokenReward'] should be checked in variable tokenReward
        Checked variables: tokenReward
            Yes The code provided is a constructor function because its name matches the contract name 'Crowdsale'. Moreover, the state variable 'tokenReward' is
            hardcoded within this constructor using the address '0x12AC8d8F0F48b7954bcdA736AF0576a12Dc8C387'. Therefore, the function satisfies both characteristics
            listed in the instructions.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
