    Check direct function security
        - function EscrowGoods.yes(uint256,string,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The structure 'if(msg.sender != info.buyer && msg.sender != seller)' does not qualify as the specific required structure since info.buyer is a part of a
          local variable (sub-property check), and not directly xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO. The condition involving msg.sender should directly compare to or involve
          the specified global roles like Owner/Address/Leader/CEO without being part of locally scoped structures.
        - function EscrowGoods.yes(uint256,string,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not have any 'require' or 'throw' statements, nor does it include setting the same variable to True/False or False/True in the
          required manner. Therefore, none of the defined patterns are satisfied.

Function Security Analysis for EscrowGoods.safeSend(address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function safeSend.
    Check direct function security
        - function EscrowGoods.safeSend(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not have any checks involving msg.sender.
        - function EscrowGoods.safeSend(address,uint256) has security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The code satisfies Structure 4, and the first two lines 'if(atomicLock) throw;' and 'atomicLock = true;' perform a state check and negation on
          'atomicLock'. This negation is done immediately before proceeding to the main logic execution in the call operation.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
