    Check direct function security
        - function v1Migration.migrate(IPackFour,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures related to 'msg.sender'. There is no check or assertion involving 'msg.sender !=
          xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO' or similar constructs as outlined in the criteria.
        - function v1Migration.migrate(IPackFour,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: In the code provided, the require statement `require(!v1Migrated[address(pack)][id], ...)` checks a condition but the state negation operation
          `v1Migrated[address(pack)][id] = true;` does not occur immediately afterwards. Instead, the code proceeds to do several operations before changing the state
          variable towards the end of the function. Therefore, the negation condition is not satisfied immediately after the require statement, failing the structural
          requirements.
