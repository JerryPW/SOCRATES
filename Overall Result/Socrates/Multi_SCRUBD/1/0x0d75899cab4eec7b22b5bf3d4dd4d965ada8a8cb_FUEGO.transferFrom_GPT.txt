Function Security Analysis for FUEGO.transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function transferFrom.
    Check direct function security
        - function FUEGO.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not include any check on 'msg.sender == xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO' nor 'msg.sender != xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO'. There are
          no require, assert, or if statements involving msg.sender and a specific role like Owner, Address, Leader, or CEO.
        - function FUEGO.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function uses require statement but it does not match any of the specified structures.

Function Security Analysis for FUEGO._transfer(address,address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _transfer.
    Check direct function security
        - function FUEGO._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not check whether the msg.sender is equal to any specific role (like Owner, CEO, or Address) or not. Hence, it does not match any of the
          given structures.
        - function FUEGO._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any statement such as 'require(xxx == True); xxx = False;' or 'require(xxx == False); xxx = True;' or 'require(!xxx); xxx =
          True;' or 'if(!xxx) throw; xxx = true;' for any variable 'xxx'. It uses a variety of 'require()' statements with conditions like 'from != address(0)', 'amount >
          0', etc., but none match the specified structures that involve checking a boolean variable and then setting it to the opposite value within the same function.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transfer', '_transfer', 'transferFrom', 'swapForTokenomics']
        Function Security Analysis for FUEGO.transfer(address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transfer.
            Check direct function security
                - function FUEGO.transfer(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any checks related to msg.sender being compared with xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO using require, if, or assert
                  statements.
                - function FUEGO.transfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures. The function is a simple token transfer implementation and does not contain
                  any require or if statements regarding the condition of a boolean variable as described in the conditions.

Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: FUEGO.swapForTokenomics(uint256)
Function Security Analysis for FUEGO.swapForTokenomics(uint256)
    The modifier of function swapForTokenomics are ['lockTheSwap']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier lockTheSwap is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: Upon reviewing the code for the modifier 'lockTheSwap', it is clear that both the locking and unlocking operations are present in the structure. The
          variable 'inSwapAndLiquify' is set to true at the beginning of the modifier and is reset to false at the end. This pattern effectively prevents reentrancy by
          ensuring the function encompassed by this modifier can only be entered once at a time. Hence, the locking mechanism is correctly implemented, satisfying rule 2.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
