Function Security Analysis for GLITCH.swapAndLiquifyForEth(uint256)
    The modifier of function swapAndLiquifyForEth are ['lockTheSwap']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier lockTheSwap is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The code provided for the modifier 'lockTheSwap' indeed sets a flag 'inSwapAndLiquify' to true before executing the function and resets it to false
          afterward. This matches with rule 2, which indicates the use of a lock operation to ensure the function is executed only once at a time. Thus, there are no
          structural omissions found in the code with regard to rule 2.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _sendRewardInterestToPool.
    Check direct function security
        - function GLITCH._sendRewardInterestToPool() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any statements involving checking msg.sender against an owner's or a specific address related to access control, nor does
          it include assertions or exceptions (throws) related to msg.sender.
        - function GLITCH._sendRewardInterestToPool() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function does not include any 'require' statements or explicit boolean checks as outlined in the provided characteristics. It deals with balance
          calculations and conditional execution based on token amounts, without using the specific variable handling structure described.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transfer', 'swapAndLiquifyForEth', '_transfer', 'swapAndLiquifyForTokens', 'transferFrom']

            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transfer.
            Check direct function security
                - function GLITCH.transfer(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not check the msg.sender against any owner, address, or role (Owner/Address/Leader/CEO) using require, if, or assert
                  statements.
                - function GLITCH.transfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code does not include any 'require', 'throw', or similar conditional statements that check and change the state of a boolean
                  variable in a specific pattern. It simply performs a transfer operation and returns true.

        There are ['currentPoolAddress'] should be checked in variable currentPoolAddress
        Checked variables: currentPoolAddress
            Yes The first piece of code is a constructor, as indicated by the function name 'constructor' and the fact that it does not have a return type. The
            constructor initializes several state variables, including setting 'currentPoolAddress' using a call to 'IUniswapV2Factory'. Thus, the code satisfies the
            first characteristic, meeting the condition that it matches the function 'constructor'.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: GLITCH._transfer(address,address,uint256)
Function Security Analysis for GLITCH._transfer(address,address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _transfer.
    Check direct function security
        - function GLITCH._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The provided code uses `msg.sender` for some logic but does not compare it against an owner, address, Leader, CEO, or similar entity for a strict sender
          verification. Thus, it does not fit the rules provided in the characteristics.
        - function GLITCH._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not include any 'require(xxx == True)', 'require(xxx == False)', 'require(!xxx)', or 'if(!xxx) throw' structures that change the variable
          value (xxx = True or xxx = False) post-requirement or condition. It has 'require' and 'if' statements, but they do not follow the forms specified in the
          characteristics list.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transfer', 'swapAndLiquifyForEth', 'swapAndLiquifyForTokens', '_transfer', 'transferFrom']

            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transfer.
            Check direct function security
                - function GLITCH.transfer(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The provided code does not contain any requirement, condition, or assertion that specifically checks for msg.sender compared to an
                  xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO, thus it does not match any of the given structures.
                - function GLITCH.transfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the required patterns such as require statements with conditions changing a variable's state or a
                  specific throw pattern followed by a variable assignment. Thus, it doesn't satisfy any of the given conditions.

Start analyze function: GLITCH.swapAndLiquifyForTokens(address,uint256)
Function Security Analysis for GLITCH.swapAndLiquifyForTokens(address,uint256)
    The modifier of function swapAndLiquifyForTokens are ['lockTheSwap']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier lockTheSwap is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The code snippet for the modifier 'lockTheSwap' shows both steps of a lock operation: setting the flag 'inSwapAndLiquify' to true at the beginning and
          resetting it to false at the end, ensuring rule 2 is satisfied.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
