Function Security Analysis for NamiPool._withdrawNAC(address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _withdrawNAC.
    Check direct function security
        - function NamiPool._withdrawNAC(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not check if msg.sender is equal to xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO using require, if, or assert statements.
        - function NamiPool._withdrawNAC(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function contains a require statement that checks if 'namiPool[_roundIndex][_shareAddress].stake' is greater than 0. However, the require statement
          doesn't directly check for a boolean condition nor does it flip a boolean variable. The require condition is numerical, checking if 'stake' is greater than
          zero. Therefore, the code doesn't fit any of the specified structures because it's dealing with numerical values rather than boolean variables that are set or
          flipped.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['withdrawNonTop', 'withdrawTopForTeam', 'withdrawTop', 'withdrawNonTopForTeam']
        Function Security Analysis for NamiPool.withdrawNonTop(uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function withdrawNonTop.
            Check direct function security
                - function NamiPool.withdrawNonTop(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not perform any check against a specific role owner (e.g., xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO). It only makes general checks
                  for conditions unrelated to msg.sender ownership.
                - function NamiPool.withdrawNonTop(uint256) has security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The code matches Structure 2. The statements 'require(namiPool[_roundIndex][msg.sender].isWithdrawn == false);' and
                  'namiPool[_roundIndex][msg.sender].isWithdrawn = true;' are present in sequence, before the main logic within the conditional block executes. The state
                  negation occurs right after the 'require' check and before the Withdraw and _withdrawNAC function calls.
        Function Security Analysis for NamiPool.withdrawTopForTeam(address,uint256)
            The modifier of function withdrawTopForTeam are ['onlyEscrow']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyEscrow is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The code contains 'require(msg.sender == escrow);', which enforces that only the specific address stored in 'escrow' can execute the function.
                  This clearly matches rule 1, as the structure checks for a specific sender address.
        Function Security Analysis for NamiPool.withdrawTop(uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function withdrawTop.
            Check direct function security
                - function NamiPool.withdrawTop(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not check or assert whether msg.sender is an owner or has special permissions such as ownership or higher administrative rights.
                  It only uses msg.sender to reference a participant in the namiPool based on their activity and withdrawal status.
                - function NamiPool.withdrawTop(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not have any of the specified structures with 'require' followed by an assignment to the same variable, nor does it feature the
                  'if' and 'throw' combination followed by an assignment to the same variable. Thus, none of the given patterns are matched.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['namiToken.balanceOf(this)', 'namiToken.transfer(_shareAddress,namiPool[_roundIndex][_shareAddress].stake)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - namiToken.transfer(_shareAddress,namiPool[_roundIndex][_shareAddress].stake) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - namiToken.balanceOf(this) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - namiToken.transfer(_shareAddress,namiPool[_roundIndex][_shareAddress].stake) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['namiToken.balanceOf(this)', 'namiToken.transfer(_shareAddress,namiPool[_roundIndex][_shareAddress].stake)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['NamiAddr'] should be checked in variable namiToken
        Checked variables: NamiAddr
            Yes The code provided is a constructor function because its name matches the contract name 'NamiPool'. However, the state variable 'NamiAddr' is not hardcoded
            in the constructor; it is assigned the value passed as the '_namiAddress' parameter.
        There are ['NamiAddr'] should be checked in variable namiToken
        Checked variables: NamiAddr
            Yes The code provided is a function named 'NamiPool', which matches the contract name, indicating that it's likely a constructor function that initializes
            state variables. This satisfies the first characteristic that identifies a function as a constructor if it has the same name as the contract.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
