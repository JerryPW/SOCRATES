Function Security Analysis for Brave3d.buyByAddress(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function buyByAddress.
    Check direct function security
        - function Brave3d.buyByAddress(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures where `msg.sender` is checked against a specific owner or leader address in the conditions
          using require, if, or assert statements that verify access or authority.
        - function Brave3d.buyByAddress(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures where a `require` statement or an `if` statement directly checks the truthiness or falsiness
          of a variable (`xxx`), subsequently changing its value. The `require` in this code checks a hardcoded value `false` directly, not a variable, which does not
          meet the pattern requirements.

Function Security Analysis for Brave3d.overStage(uint8)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function overStage.
    Check direct function security
        - function Brave3d.overStage(uint8) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures involving `msg.sender`. It deals with game state management and does not include a check
          for specific sender permissions.
        - function Brave3d.overStage(uint8) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon reviewing the code again, it appears that it only contains 'assert(!finishStage.isFinish);', which is similar to the first statement of one of the
          required structures. However, the code does not contain a subsequent matching 'finishStage.isFinish = true;' statement required to complete the structure. Thus,
          only one matching statement is found and the complete structure cannot be confirmed. The code does not meet the conditions fully as per any of the specified
          structures.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['withdraw', 'buyByName', 'setName', 'forceOverStage', 'buyFromValue', 'buyByAddress']
        Function Security Analysis for Brave3d.withdraw()
            The modifier of function withdraw are ['hasEarnings']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier hasEarnings has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier 'hasEarnings' only checks if '_valueMap[msg.sender]' is greater than 0 and does not enforce ownership restrictions or use a lock
                  operation. It doesn't suggest any owner-specific permissions or reentrancy prevention based on its structure or name.
            Check direct function security
                - function Brave3d.withdraw() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The given function does not include any require, assert, or if statements that check explicitly for 'msg.sender ==
                  xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO' or 'msg.sender != xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO'.
                - function Brave3d.withdraw() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures that involve the 'require' statement with a boolean expression assignment or check
                  followed by assignment as described. The function simply assigns and resets values without any boolean requirement logic fitting the described patterns.
