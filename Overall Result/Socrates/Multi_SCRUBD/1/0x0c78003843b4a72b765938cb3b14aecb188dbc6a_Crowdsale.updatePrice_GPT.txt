Function Security Analysis for Crowdsale.updatePrice()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function updatePrice.
    Check direct function security
        - function Crowdsale.updatePrice() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: There is no check involving msg.sender against xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
        - function Crowdsale.updatePrice() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function does not contain a `require` or `if` statement with negation, followed by setting the negated variable to `True`, and does not match any of
          the provided structures. No variable is set to `False` or `True` after a `require(xxx == True)` or `require(xxx == False)` statement, nor any pattern of
          throwing after checking if a condition is `False`.

Function Security Analysis for usingOraclize.oraclize_query(uint256,string,string)
    The modifier of function oraclize_query are ['oraclizeAPI']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier oraclizeAPI has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier `oraclizeAPI` does not include any explicit ownership checks or lock mechanisms. Additionally, it does not have a name indicating
          restrictions like ownership or non-reentrancy.
    Check direct function security
        - function usingOraclize.oraclize_query(uint256,string,string) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any msg.sender checks related to ownership or leadership like xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO in any form required
          (neither require, if, assert).
        - function usingOraclize.oraclize_query(uint256,string,string) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code snippet doesn't contain any explicit 'require' or 'if' conditions in the specified structures that manipulate a boolean variable followed by
          flipping its state. There's no implementation of any of the required patterns.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['__callback', '__callback', 'updatePrice']

            There are no modifiers should be examined in function __callback.
            Check direct function security
                - function usingOraclize.__callback(bytes32,string) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not have any conditional checks or assertions related to msg.sender being equal to or not equal to xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
                - function usingOraclize.__callback(bytes32,string) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures like 'require(xxx == True); xxx = False;' or similar. It simply defines a
                  function '.__callback' that calls another '.callback'. There are no 'require' statements or condition checks on a variable named 'xxx' followed by
                  assignments to the same variable.

Start analyze function: usingOraclize.oraclize_getPrice(string)
Function Security Analysis for usingOraclize.oraclize_getPrice(string)
    The modifier of function oraclize_getPrice are ['oraclizeAPI']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier oraclizeAPI has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier `oraclizeAPI` does not enforce owner checks, nor does it use the lock pattern. It lacks owner specific or address specific conditions and
          does not exhibit patterns associated with preventing reentrancy.
    Check direct function security
        - function usingOraclize.oraclize_getPrice(string) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures that involve `msg.sender` checks against owner or address variables.
        - function usingOraclize.oraclize_getPrice(string) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures such as `require(xxx == True); xxx = False;`, `require(xxx == False); xxx = True;`,
          `require(!xxx); xxx = True;`, or `if(!xxx) throw; xxx = true;`. It is a simple function that calls another function and returns its result.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

                - function usingOraclize.__callback(bytes32,string) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not include any of the specified structures related to checking the identity of msg.sender against an owner or similar role.
                - function usingOraclize.__callback(bytes32,string) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures such as require(xxx == True), xxx = False, or any similar ones. It is a
                  simple function definition that calls another function within it without any logic that involves the required constructs.
