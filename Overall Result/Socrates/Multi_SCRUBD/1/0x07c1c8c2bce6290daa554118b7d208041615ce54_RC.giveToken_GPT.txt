Function Security Analysis for RC.giveToken(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function giveToken.
    Check direct function security
        - function RC.giveToken(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The provided function does not have any check or assertion on the 'msg.sender'. It handles some internal transfers and token operations based on the
          '_buyer' address but does not include any condition involving 'msg.sender'. None of the specified structures appear in this function.
        - function RC.giveToken(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function contains the statement `require( pendingTokenUser[_buyer] > 0 );`, which checks that the user's pending tokens are greater than zero before
          proceeding. This condition does not match any of the specified structures as it does not explicitly check a boolean variable being true or false, nor does it
          involve changing the state of such a variable.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

        Function Security Analysis for KYCBase.buyTokensFor(address,uint64,uint256,uint8,bytes32,bytes32)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function buyTokensFor.
            Check direct function security
                - function KYCBase.buyTokensFor(address,uint64,uint256,uint8,bytes32,bytes32) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain any statement that checks if msg.sender is equal or not equal to a specific Owner, Address, Leader, or CEO. It only
                  checks if the sender is allowed using a different function.
                - function KYCBase.buyTokensFor(address,uint64,uint256,uint8,bytes32,bytes32) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures. The require statement is used, but it is just checking a condition without any
                  subsequent changes to the same variable. There's no change in the truth value of a variable that is first checked by require.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['tokenSaleContract.claim(_buyer,pendingTokenUser[_buyer])', 'tokenSaleContract.wallet().transfer(etherUser[_buyer])']
    Analyze Transfer
        - tokenSaleContract.wallet().transfer(etherUser[_buyer]) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external
        call contains '.transfer(' keyword, which matches the criteria given for making it noteworthy.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - tokenSaleContract.claim(_buyer,pendingTokenUser[_buyer]) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['tokenSaleContract.claim(_buyer,pendingTokenUser[_buyer])']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['tokenSaleContract'] should be checked in variable tokenSaleContract
        Checked variables: tokenSaleContract
            Yes The function name 'RC' matches the contract name 'RC', indicating that the function is a constructor. Constructors are typically used for initializing
            state variables or setting initial states when the contract is deployed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
