    Check direct function security
        - function Sargasso.deposit(uint256,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code checks if the user is locked, but does not verify the msg.sender's role against a specific owner or leader. There is no logic that directly
          relates msg.sender with a role or another address as required by any of the conditions.
        - function Sargasso.deposit(uint256,uint256) has security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: In the given code, after the statement 'require(userLock[msg.sender] == false);', the variable 'userLock[msg.sender]' is immediately set to 'true' with
          the statement 'userLock[msg.sender] = true;', before the main logic of the function executes. This matches the requirement for ensuring state negation is
          completed before the main logic, even though some initial steps like pool and user information retrieval occur before the logical operations like updating the
          pool or transferring rewards. As such, the conditions for structure 2 are met.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
