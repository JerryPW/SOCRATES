    There are no modifiers should be examined in function sendtoRecipient.
    Check direct function security
        - function Sargasso.sendtoRecipient(uint256,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not have any condition or assertion that checks msg.sender against xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO, which is required for a 'Yes' answer.
        - function Sargasso.sendtoRecipient(uint256,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code provided does not have any of the specified structures. It contains 'require' statements, but they do not match the structures needed. The
          statements involve conditions like 'userNum != 0' and '_amount < contractTokens', which do not set any variable as True/False after the 'require'.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['specialdeposit']
        Function Security Analysis for Sargasso.specialdeposit(uint256,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function specialdeposit.
            Check direct function security
                - function Sargasso.specialdeposit(uint256,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The provided code does not include any conditions or assertions that specifically check if msg.sender matches any specific ownership or leader
                  addresses. It purely checks for a lock on the user address without any ownership check.
                - function Sargasso.specialdeposit(uint256,uint256) has security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The code satisfies Structure 2: it starts with 'require(userLock[msg.sender] == false);' followed immediately by 'userLock[msg.sender] = true;'.
                  These statements are executed right at the beginning before the main logic of the function is executed, ensuring that userLock is set to true
                  immediately after checking its state.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
