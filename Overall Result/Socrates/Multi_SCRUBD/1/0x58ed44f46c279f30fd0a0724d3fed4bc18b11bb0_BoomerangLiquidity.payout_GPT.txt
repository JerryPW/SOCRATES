    There are no modifiers should be examined in function payout.
    Check direct function security
        - function BoomerangLiquidity.payout() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any condition or requirement that checks if `msg.sender` is equal to any specific owner, leader, CEO, or similar authority
          role.
        - function BoomerangLiquidity.payout() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain a require statement where a variable is explicitly being checked for true/false, nor does it set a variable from true to false
          or vice versa after such a check. The require statement checks if the balance is greater than 1, which doesn't match the required pattern.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.send(payoutToSend)', 'participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.call.value(payoutToSend).gas(1000000)()',
    'weak_hands.buy.value(investment).gas(1000000)(msg.sender)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.send(payoutToSend) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: This
        external call contains the '.send(' keyword, fulfilling the specified characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - The gas limit in participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.call.value(payoutToSend).gas(1000000)() is 1000000, which is too high. Therefore, it will not prevent
        REE problem.
        - The gas limit in weak_hands.buy.value(investment).gas(1000000)(msg.sender) is 1000000, which is too high. Therefore, it will not prevent REE problem.
    Remaining external call: ['participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.call.value(payoutToSend).gas(1000000)()',
    'weak_hands.buy.value(investment).gas(1000000)(msg.sender)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['participants'] should be checked in variable participants
        Checked variables: participants
            No The functions provided do not match the constructor form by name or explicit declaration, and there is no indication of hardcoded state variables. The
            functions 'deposit' and 'payout' do not involve directly setting or changing the 'participants' state variable in a hardcoded manner, as the changes depend on
            inputs or computed values.
            Function Security Analysis for BoomerangLiquidity.deposit()
                There are no modifiers should be examined in function deposit.

                      Reason: The code snippet does not match any of the given structures. There are no `require` statements or variable assignments as described.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
