Function Security Analysis for X3ProfitMainFundTransfer.fallback()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
    Check direct function security
        - function X3ProfitMainFundTransfer.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not use any require or if statements checking msg.sender against an owner or leader address directly. It checks msg.sender for a specific
          known contract address (ADDRESS_EIFP2_CONTRACT), which does not fall under the relevant characteristics.
        - function X3ProfitMainFundTransfer.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function contains the structure `{if(!xxx) throw; xxx = true; ... xxx = false;}` with `!ADDRESS_EIFP2_CONTRACT.call.value(address(this).balance)()`
          leading to `revert()` (acting as throw), followed by `isResend = true`, and ending with `isResend = false`. However, the `require` statement or `throw`
          immediately followed by setting `xxx = true` or similar is not exactly matched. The perspective depends on considering `revert();` as implicitly meeting the
          throwing condition due to the immediate failure of the call check.
