Function Security Analysis for TrustlessOTC.cancelTrade(uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function cancelTrade.
    Check direct function security
        - function TrustlessOTC.cancelTrade(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The condition 'require(msg.sender == o.creator);' uses a local variable 'o' which is derived from the TradeOffer storage object. According to the note,
          local variables such as this do not count as part of the specified structures.
        - function TrustlessOTC.cancelTrade(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not meet any of the described structures. It involves a `require` statement but does not check for a boolean variable to validate or
          toggle its state.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['Token(o.tokenFrom).transfer(o.creator,o.amountFrom)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - Token(o.tokenFrom).transfer(o.creator,o.amountFrom) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - Token(o.tokenFrom).transfer(o.creator,o.amountFrom) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['Token(o.tokenFrom).transfer(o.creator,o.amountFrom)']
    Analyze External Address
        The variable 'o' in external call 'Token(o.tokenFrom).transfer(o.creator,o.amountFrom)' has no state variable assigned in TrustlessOTC.cancelTrade(uint256).
        Therefore we check whether it has been hardcoded in the function.
            No The code defines a function `cancelTrade` which takes a `tradeID` as an argument, and uses this `tradeID` to access a `TradeOffer` object `o` from an
            `offers` mapping. The operations that follow use the properties of `o`, which are dynamically retrieved based on the input `tradeID` provided when calling the
            function. This means the behavior of the function depends on the input provided at runtime rather than a pre-set value embedded in the code, indicating the
            absence of hardcoding.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
