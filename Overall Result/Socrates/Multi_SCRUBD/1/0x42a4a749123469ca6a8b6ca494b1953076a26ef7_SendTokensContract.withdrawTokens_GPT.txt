    Analyze External Address
        There are ['tokenReward'] should be checked in variable tokenReward
        Checked variables: tokenReward
            No 1. The function is named 'setTokenReward', which does not match the contract name 'SendTokensContract' and is not explicitly named 'constructor'.
            Therefore, it is not a constructor.  2. The state variable 'tokenReward' is being set with a passed parameter '_tokenContractAddress', not a hardcoded value.
            Thus, there is no hardcoded state variable in the function.  Given the above reasons, none of the conditions are satisfied.
            Function Security Analysis for SendTokensContract.setTokenReward(address)
                The modifier of function setTokenReward are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: Rule 1: The modifier contains require(msg.sender == owner), which enforces that only the owner can execute the function. There are no
                      structural omissions, as this directly matches the rule for checking sender identity.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
