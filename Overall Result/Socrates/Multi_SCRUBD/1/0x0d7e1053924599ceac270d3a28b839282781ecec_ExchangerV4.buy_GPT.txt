Function Security Analysis for ExchangerV4.buy(uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function buy.
    Check direct function security
        - function ExchangerV4.buy(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any checks or assertions involving `msg.sender` to compare it to an owner, address, leader, or CEO. It only emits events and
          transfers tokens based on conditions involving `msg.value`.
        - function ExchangerV4.buy(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not follow any of the specified patterns. The require(enabled) statement is a condition but does not have an assignment to enabled
          variable after it. The other require statements are checks for conditions and do not involve enabled-like structure mentioned in the conditions, nor do they
          involve throwing an error and then assigning to the same variable. Thus, none of the patterns in the list match this code.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['creator.transfer(transferToSafeWallet)', 'formulaContract.calculatePurchaseReturn((tokenContract.totalSupply()-uncirculatedSupplyCount)-
    tokenContract.balanceOf(this),(address(this).balance+virtualReserveBalance)-msg.value,weight,msg.value)', 'tokenContract.balanceOf(this)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - creator.transfer(transferToSafeWallet) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains
        the '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - formulaContract.calculatePurchaseReturn((tokenContract.totalSupply()-uncirculatedSupplyCount)-
        tokenContract.balanceOf(this),(address(this).balance+virtualReserveBalance)-msg.value,weight,msg.value) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - tokenContract.balanceOf(this) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['formulaContract.calculatePurchaseReturn((tokenContract.totalSupply()-uncirculatedSupplyCount)-
    tokenContract.balanceOf(this),(address(this).balance+virtualReserveBalance)-msg.value,weight,msg.value)', 'tokenContract.balanceOf(this)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['formulaContract'] should be checked in variable formulaContract
        Checked variables: formulaContract
            Yes The code snippet provided contains a function named 'constructor', which is explicitly defined as a constructor and matches the second characteristic
            outlined. Additionally, the state variable 'formulaContract' is used in the constructor to assign the input address '_formulaContract' to it. No other
            instances of hardcoded state variables are present in this snippet.
        There are ['tokenContract'] should be checked in variable tokenContract
        Checked variables: tokenContract
            Yes The function provided is named 'constructor', which means it is explicitly identified as a constructor function.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
