    Check direct function security
        - function Escrow.cancelTokenTransaction(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not have any condition that checks if msg.sender is related to any ownership or leadership role like xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or
          CEO.
        - function Escrow.cancelTokenTransaction(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code contains the statement `require(transaction.status == transactionStatus.Pending)` and later sets `transaction.status` to
          `transactionStatus.Canceled`. Although this does not perfectly match any of the specified patterns, it is similar to the first pattern in terms of checking a
          condition and then updating the state variable.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['cancel']
        Function Security Analysis for Escrow.cancel(address)
            The modifier of function cancel are ['onlyAllowed']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyAllowed is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The modifier contains the condition 'require(msg.sender == owner || msg.sender == eternal.getAddress(0));', which enforces that only the 'owner'
                  or a specific address can execute the function. This satisfies the criteria of rule 1, which checks for statements that allow only certain addresses to
                  execute the function.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
