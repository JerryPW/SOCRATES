    There are no modifiers should be examined in function processPayment.
    Check direct function security
        - function EasySmartolution.processPayment(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not check whether msg.sender is equal or not equal to any Owner/Address/Leader/CEO before executing its main logic. It doesn't have
          any control structure like require, if, or assert that involve checking the msg.sender.
        - function EasySmartolution.processPayment(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specific structures provided. 1. There is no explicit require statement that checks for a variable equal to true or
          false followed by negating it. 2. There is no if statement that checks a negated variable and throws, followed by setting the variable to true. The code checks
          a condition with 'if' but does not negate the same variable and also lacks a require or throw statement.

    Analyze External Address
        There are ['participants'] should be checked in variable participant
        Checked variables: participants
            No The code does not contain a constructor, as none of the function names match the contract name 'EasySmartolution' and there is no explicit 'constructor'
            keyword used. Additionally, the state variable 'participants' is not hardcoded in any of the given functions; it is dynamically updated based on the function
            logic provided by the address passed as a parameter (e.g., '_address' or 'msg.sender').
            Function Security Analysis for EasySmartolution.addParticipant(address,address)
                There are no modifiers should be examined in function addParticipant.
                Check direct function security
                    - function EasySmartolution.addParticipant(address,address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                      Reason: The code does not implement any check or assertion for msg.sender being equal to any owner or address with specific rights. It only has
                      checks for values and addresses, without any comparison involving msg.sender and a specific role or address.
                    - function EasySmartolution.addParticipant(address,address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                      Reason: The given code doesn't contain any structure that matches the specified patterns. There are no require statements followed by setting the
                      same variable to a boolean value nor an if statement to throw followed by setting a variable true.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
