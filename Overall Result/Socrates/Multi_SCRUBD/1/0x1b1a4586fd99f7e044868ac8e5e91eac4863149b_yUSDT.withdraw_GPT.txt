Function Security Analysis for yUSDT.withdraw(uint256)
    The modifier of function withdraw are ['nonReentrant']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier nonReentrant is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The code uses a guard counter mechanism to prevent reentrancy, which involves setting a counter before the function execution ('_guardCounter += 1') and
          checking the condition after execution ('require(localCounter == _guardCounter, "ReentrancyGuard: reentrant call")') to ensure the state has not changed during
          execution. This satisfies structure 2 for lock operations, where an entry is allowed only once by using the setup before allowing re-entry and verification
          afterward.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
