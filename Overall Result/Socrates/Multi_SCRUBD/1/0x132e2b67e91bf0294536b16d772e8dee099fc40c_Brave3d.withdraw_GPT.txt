Start analyze function: Brave3d.withdraw()
Function Security Analysis for Brave3d.withdraw()
    The modifier of function withdraw are ['hasEarnings']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier hasEarnings has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier hasEarnings does not explicitly enforce any owner or specific address execution restriction, nor does it show any signs of a locking
          mechanism. Additionally, the modifier name does not suggest any owner control or reentrancy protection.
    Check direct function security
        - function Brave3d.withdraw() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any msg.sender checks for xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
        - function Brave3d.withdraw() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures like 'require(xxx == True)' followed by modifying the same variable to 'False' or vice versa;
          it also doesn't follow the '!xxx' pattern or the '{if(!xxx) throw; xxx = true;}' pattern.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['msg.sender.transfer(amount)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - msg.sender.transfer(amount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains '.transfer('
        keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: Brave3d.overStage(uint8)
Function Security Analysis for Brave3d.overStage(uint8)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function overStage.
    Check direct function security
        - function Brave3d.overStage(uint8) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not check for msg.sender equal to a specific owner or address, nor check for inequality involving msg.sender being not equal to any
          specific owner or address, and it also doesn't use assertions involving msg.sender.
        - function Brave3d.overStage(uint8) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon re-evaluating the code, the original response might have been incorrect. The code contains 'assert(!finishStage.isFinish);', which matches the
          condition 'require(!xxx);' or 'assert(!xxx);', but the structure is incomplete because it is missing the statement 'xxx = True;' or 'xxx = true;' following it.
          Thus, none of the required structures are fully present.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['buyFromValue', 'setName', 'buyByAddress', 'buyByName', 'withdraw', 'forceOverStage']
        Function Security Analysis for Brave3d.buyFromValue(uint8)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function buyFromValue.
            Check direct function security
                - function Brave3d.buyFromValue(uint8) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not include any access control checks related to specific roles, such as xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO, related to the
                  msg.sender.
                - function Brave3d.buyFromValue(uint8) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: There are no structures that match any of the four described patterns, which involve checking a boolean condition with `require` or `if` and
                  modifying a corresponding variable.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['p3dContract.myDividends(true)', 'p3dContract.withdraw()', 'p3dContract.buy.value(P3D_VALUE*rate)(address(OFFICIAL_P3D))']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - p3dContract.myDividends(true) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - p3dContract.withdraw() ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - p3dContract.buy.value(P3D_VALUE*rate)(address(OFFICIAL_P3D)) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['p3dContract.myDividends(true)', 'p3dContract.withdraw()', 'p3dContract.buy.value(P3D_VALUE*rate)(address(OFFICIAL_P3D))']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['p3dContract'] should be checked in variable p3dContract
        Checked variables: p3dContract
            State variable p3dContract has initialized in public area after declaration.
        There are ['p3dContract'] should be checked in variable p3dContract
        Checked variables: p3dContract
            State variable p3dContract has initialized in public area after declaration.
        There are ['p3dContract'] should be checked in variable p3dContract
        Checked variables: p3dContract
            State variable p3dContract has initialized in public area after declaration.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
