    Analyze External Address
        There are ['synth'] should be checked in variable synth
        Checked variables: synth
            Yes The provided code includes a constructor for the Depot contract, characterized by a function that is explicitly named 'constructor'. In this constructor,
            the state variable 'synth' is being initialized based on an external input parameter, but it is not hardcoded.
