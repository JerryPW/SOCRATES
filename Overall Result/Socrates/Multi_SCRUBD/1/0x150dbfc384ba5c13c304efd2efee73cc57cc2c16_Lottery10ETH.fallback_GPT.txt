    Analyze External Address
        There are ['LT'] should be checked in variable LT
        Checked variables: LT
            Yes The function is explicitly named 'constructor', which means it is the constructor of the contract.
        There are ['x'] should be checked in variable x
        Checked variables: x
            Yes 1. The code provided includes a constructor function: `constructor(address RS_Addr)`. This function matches the typical definition of a constructor by
            being explicitly named `constructor`, thus satisfying the first characteristic of being a constructor.  2. The constructor function initializes several state
            variables but does not hardcode any values for these variables. Instead, it initializes or sets these state variables with new contracts or passed-in
            parameters (`RS_Addr`).  Therefore, the presence of the constructor satisfies the first characteristic.
        There are ['RS'] should be checked in variable RS
        Checked variables: RS
            Yes The code provided is a constructor function because its name matches the contract's name 'Lottery10ETH'.
        There are ['RS'] should be checked in variable RS
        Checked variables: RS
            Yes The provided code snippet is a constructor, as it has the same name as the contract (Lottery10ETH) and is clearly labeled as a 'constructor'. Therefore,
            it satisfies the first characteristic.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: Lottery10ETH.drawing()
Function Security Analysis for Lottery10ETH.drawing()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function drawing.
    Check direct function security
        - function Lottery10ETH.drawing() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code in the function `drawing()` does not contain any of the structures specified as characteristics to look for regarding direct control over the
          function execution by checking `msg.sender` against specific ownership or leadership identifiers.
        - function Lottery10ETH.drawing() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures involving a requirement on a boolean variable followed by its negation. It primarily involves
          arithmetic checks, variable assignments related to the blockchain's state (like block number and player selection), and actions performed based on those
          conditions, but does not utilize a boolean logic change after a requirement or a throw for a single variable as outlined.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['fallback']
        Function Security Analysis for Lottery10ETH.fallback()
            The modifier of function fallback are ['notFromContract']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier notFromContract has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: This modifier checks if the caller is not a contract by verifying extcodesize, but it does not fulfill the criteria under the provided
                  characteristics, as it's neither enforcing ownership/address checks nor employing a lock mechanism. The modifier is also not named in a way to suggest
                  ownership or reentrancy protection.
            Check direct function security
                - function Lottery10ETH.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures that check if 'msg.sender' is equal to or not equal to 'xxxOwner', 'xxxAddress',
                  'Leader', or 'CEO'.
                - function Lottery10ETH.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures where a 'require' statement checks for a boolean condition on a variable and then
                  changes that variable's state, or uses an 'if' statement followed by a 'throw' and then changes the variable's state. The conditions checked are related
                  to array lengths and boolean flags, but do not follow the specified structures of changing the same variable's state after a 'require' or 'if' check.

        There are ['x'] should be checked in variable x
        Checked variables: x
            Yes The code contains a constructor with the name 'constructor', matching the criterion for the function being a constructor.
        There are ['x'] should be checked in variable x
        Checked variables: x
            Yes 1. The given code includes a function with the signature 'constructor(address RS_Addr) public'. This indicates that this function is a constructor, as its
            name is explicitly 'constructor'.
        There are ['WT'] should be checked in variable WT
        Checked variables: WT
            Yes The provided code contains a constructor, as it is explicitly labeled with the keyword 'constructor'. However, although a state variable 'WT' is mentioned
            in the constructor, it is initialized using a function call (new WinnerTicket()), rather than being hardcoded to a specific value. Thus, the conditions for
            the presence of a constructor are satisfied.
        There are ['WT'] should be checked in variable WT
        Checked variables: WT
            Yes The function is explicitly named 'constructor', indicating it is a constructor. In addition, the state variable 'WT' is being assigned with 'new
            WinnerTicket()', which is a hardcoded initialization.
        There are ['RS'] should be checked in variable RS
        Checked variables: RS
            Yes The code snippet provided is a constructor because it has the same name as the contract (or could be explicitly named 'constructor' in new Solidity
            versions), matching the first characteristic of an external call function. However, the state variable 'RS' is not hardcoded in the constructor, as it is
            assigned using the parameter 'RS_Addr'.
        There are ['WT'] should be checked in variable WT
        Checked variables: WT
            Yes The provided code snippet contains a constructor function because the function name does not explicitly match the contract name 'Lottery10ETH', but it
            uses the keyword 'constructor', indicating it is a constructor. Therefore, this satisfies the first characteristic.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
