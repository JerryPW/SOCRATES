Function Security Analysis for LiquidityPool.reinvestRewards(bool,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function reinvestRewards.
    Check direct function security
        - function LiquidityPool.reinvestRewards(bool,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not check msg.sender against any specific xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO, nor does it assert or require msg.sender checking against any
          specific role.
        - function LiquidityPool.reinvestRewards(bool,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the required structures as per the specified characteristics. There is a 'require' statement but it does not meet the
          pattern of requiring a bool to be true or false, followed by reversing its boolean value.

    Analyze External Address
        There are ['minter'] should be checked in variable minter
        Checked variables: minter
            Yes The provided code contains a function that is explicitly named 'constructor'. This is determined by the presence of the 'constructor' keyword in the
            function signature. Therefore, according to the first characteristic, the condition is satisfied.
        There are ['minter'] should be checked in variable minter
        Checked variables: minter
            Yes 1. The first function in the provided code is a constructor as it is explicitly named 'constructor'. Therefore, based on the first characteristic that
            checks whether the function is a constructor, the external call satisfies the rule. 2. The state variable 'minter' is hardcoded in the constructor with the
            address '0x28e484dBD6BB501D37EFC8cD4b8dc33121cC78be'. Since this satisfies the second characteristic of having a hardcoded state variable, the external call
            also meets the rule.
        There are ['uniswapV2'] should be checked in variable uniswapV2
        Checked variables: uniswapV2
            Yes 1. The function with the name 'constructor' is indeed a constructor because it matches the typical nomenclature for constructors in Solidity contracts,
            explicitly named 'constructor'. 2. Additionally, the constructor hardcodes the state variable 'uniswapV2' with a specific address
            (0x7a250d5630B4cF539739dF2C5dAcb4c659F2488D).
        There are ['uniswapV2'] should be checked in variable uniswapV2
        Checked variables: uniswapV2
            Yes The code provided includes a constructor function that sets up various state variables when the contract is deployed. One of the state variables set up in
            the constructor is `uniswapV2`, which is initialized with a hardcoded address `0x7a250d5630B4cF539739dF2C5dAcb4c659F2488D`. This satisfies characteristic 2
            because the state variable `uniswapV2` has been hardcoded in the constructor.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
