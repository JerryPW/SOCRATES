Function Security Analysis for VestingContractABX.transfer(address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function transfer.
    Check direct function security
        - function VestingContractABX.transfer(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not include any checks or assertions comparing msg.sender to xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
        - function VestingContractABX.transfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not contain any of the required structures such as 'require(xxx == True); xxx = False;' or 'require(xxx == False); xxx = True;' or
          'require(!xxx); xxx = True;' or 'if(!xxx) throw; xxx = true;'. Instead, it uses a complex condition with multiple checks in the 'require' statement, and no
          sequential assignment altering the same boolean variable. Thus, it does not match any of the specified structures.

    Analyze External Address
        There are ['abx_token'] should be checked in variable abx_token
        Checked variables: abx_token
            Yes The provided function is a constructor for the contract because its name, 'VestingContractABX', matches the name of the contract 'VestingContractABX'. In
            the context of Solidity programming before version 0.4.22, constructors were declared by using a function with the same name as the contract. Thus, it
            satisfies the first characteristic as a constructor.
        There are ['abx_token'] should be checked in variable abx_token
        Checked variables: abx_token
            Yes The code includes a function named 'VestingContractABX', which matches the contract name 'VestingContractABX'. This indicates that the function is a
            constructor.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
