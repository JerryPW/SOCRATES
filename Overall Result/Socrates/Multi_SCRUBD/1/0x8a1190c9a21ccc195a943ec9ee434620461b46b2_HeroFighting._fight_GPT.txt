    Check direct function security
        - function HeroFighting._fight(uint32,uint32) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any checks or assertions involving msg.sender in relation to xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.

          Reason: Upon reviewing, the previous response was incorrect as it did not fully adhere to one of the specified structures.   - The code includes the condition
          'if(!flag)' but lacks a direct 'throw' statement following this condition so it does not match the 'if(!xxx) throw;' pattern neither it is a direct variable
          assignment to true/false afterwards.   Therefore, there is no full match for any of the defined structures in the provided code segment.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    There are no reachable function for internal/private function, please manually check its successor contracts.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
