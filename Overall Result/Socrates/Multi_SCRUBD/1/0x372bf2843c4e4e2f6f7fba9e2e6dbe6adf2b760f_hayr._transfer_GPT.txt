    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _transfer.
    Check direct function security
        - function hayr._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain the structures that check msg.sender against an owner or leadership role directly for access control purposes.
        - function hayr._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain the required structure such as a variable being checked with 'require' and subsequently modified in a way that matches the
          given patterns. There are checks and multiple 'require' statements, but they do not fit the specified patterns.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transfer', 'transferFrom']
        Function Security Analysis for hayr.transfer(address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transfer.
            Check direct function security
                - function hayr.transfer(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any checks related to msg.sender such as require, if, or assert statements that involve an owner, leader, or CEO
                  type of condition.
                - function hayr.transfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The function provided does not contain any require or if statements, nor does it involve any variable assignments changing a boolean variable
                  from true to false or vice versa. Therefore, it does not match any of the specified characteristics.

        There are ['hayReflections'] should be checked in variable hayReflections
        Checked variables: hayReflections
            Yes 1. The function code provided has the name 'constructor' which indicates that it is a constructor function. Constructor functions directly satisfy the
            first characteristic as they are responsible for initializing the contract's state, especially at deployment time. Additionally, even if not named
            specifically like the contract, the keyword 'constructor' is sufficient to mark it as such.  2. The state variable 'hayReflections' is being initialized with
            'new HayReflections()'. This means it is being set in the constructor, hence considered hardcoded according to the given definition, meeting the second
            characteristic.
        There are ['hayReflections'] should be checked in variable hayReflections
        Checked variables: hayReflections
            Yes The function in the provided code is named 'constructor', which directly matches with the second characteristic for determining if it is a constructor
            function. The constructor also initializes certain state variables, including 'hayReflections'. While 'hayReflections' is not exactly hardcoded, it is
            instantiated as a new object, which is part of constructor-specific initialization. Thus, the code qualifies for the first characteristic that it is a
            constructor function.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: hayr.swapBack()
Function Security Analysis for hayr.swapBack()
    The modifier of function swapBack are ['lockTheSwap']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier lockTheSwap is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The modifier 'lockTheSwap' sets the flag 'inSwapAndLiquify' to true before executing the function and resets it to false afterward, ensuring the
          function can only enter once, thereby fulfilling rule 2 completely. Both the lock (set to true) and unlock (set to false) operations are present in the code.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
