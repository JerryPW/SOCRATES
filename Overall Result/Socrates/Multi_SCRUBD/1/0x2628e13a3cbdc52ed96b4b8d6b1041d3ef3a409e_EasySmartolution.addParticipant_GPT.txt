Function Security Analysis for EasySmartolution.addParticipant(address,address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function addParticipant.
    Check direct function security
        - function EasySmartolution.addParticipant(address,address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any requirement or conditional checks for the identity of msg.sender involving an xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO.
        - function EasySmartolution.addParticipant(address,address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function does not have any of the required structures. There are no instances of 'require(xxx == True); xxx = False;' or 'require(xxx == False); xxx
          = True;' or 'require(!xxx); xxx = True;' or 'if(!xxx) throw; xxx = true;' present in the code.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['_referrer.send(msg.value/20)', 'processing.send(msg.value/20)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - _referrer.send(msg.value/20) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call contains '.send(' keyword,
        which matches the second specified characteristic of the rules.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - processing.send(msg.value/20) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call contains '.send(' keyword,
        which matches the second specified characteristic of the rules.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: EasySmartolution.processPayment(address)
Function Security Analysis for EasySmartolution.processPayment(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function processPayment.
    Check direct function security
        - function EasySmartolution.processPayment(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: None of the conditions in the prompt are met as there are no checks involving msg.sender against any specific party.
        - function EasySmartolution.processPayment(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not contain any of the specified structures. It lacks any 'require' or 'if' statement with '!xxx' or 'xxx == True/False' condition,
          nor does it have any assignment to the 'xxx' variable immediately after such a conditional check.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['participant.processPayment.value(participant.daily())()']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - participant.processPayment.value(participant.daily())() ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['participant.processPayment.value(participant.daily())()']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['participants'] should be checked in variable participant
        Checked variables: participants
            No The code provided does not include a constructor, as none of the functions match the contract name 'EasySmartolution' nor are explicitly named
            'constructor'. Also, the function addParticipant only modifies the state variable 'participants' in a way dependent on input rather than hardcoding.
            Function Security Analysis for EasySmartolution.addParticipant(address,address)
                There are no modifiers should be examined in function addParticipant.
                Check direct function security
                    - function EasySmartolution.addParticipant(address,address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                      Reason: The provided function does not contain any of the specific message sender checks on roles like Owner, Leader, CEO, or equivalent. It uses
                      require statements for other checks, but not specifically related to msg.sender against predefined roles.
                    - function EasySmartolution.addParticipant(address,address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                      Reason: The function does not use any of the required structures listed above. There's no use of 'require' for checking a boolean variable being
                      true or false and then flipping it. Additionally, there's no conditional block that throws an error and then changes a boolean variable. The code
                      mostly handles address initialization, payment processing, and emitting an event.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
