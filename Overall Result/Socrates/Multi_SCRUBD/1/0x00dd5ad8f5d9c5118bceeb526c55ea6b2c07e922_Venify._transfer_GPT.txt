Function Security Analysis for Venify._transfer(address,address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _transfer.
    Check direct function security
        - function Venify._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any check for msg.sender against any xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO, which is typically indicative of access restrictions or
          ownership checks.
        - function Venify._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: This code snippet does not match any of the specified structures. None of the conditional statements or logical operations follow the patterns outlined
          in the four provided structures. The code includes logic for conditions related to boolean flags like 'inSwapAndLiquify', but it does not follow any of the
          identified formats.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transferFrom', 'transfer']
        Function Security Analysis for Venify.transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transferFrom.
            Check direct function security
                - function Venify.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not check msg.sender against any specific owner or authority roles such as Owner, Address, Leader, or CEO.
                - function Venify.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The function provided does not contain any 'require' statements or 'if' condition that checks or enforces whether a variable is true or false as
                  per the specified structures before changing the state of the same variable.

Start analyze function: Venify.swapTokensForETH(uint256)
Function Security Analysis for Venify.swapTokensForETH(uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function swapTokensForETH.
    Check direct function security
        - function Venify.swapTokensForETH(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any 'require', 'if', or 'assert' statements involving 'msg.sender'.
        - function Venify.swapTokensForETH(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures. There is no use of a 'require' statement or 'if(!xxx) throw' that modifies a boolean value as
          described.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transferFrom', '_transfer', 'transfer']
        Function Security Analysis for Venify.transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transferFrom.
            Check direct function security
                - function Venify.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not have checks or conditions related to msg.sender in forms of require, if, or assert stating equality or inequality with a
                  specific Owner/Address/Leader/CEO.
                - function Venify.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the required structures such as `require(xxx == True)`, `require(xxx == False)`, `require(!xxx)`, or `if(!xxx)
                  throw` followed by statements with toggling the same variable and matching exactly the outlined pattern.

        There are ['uniswapV2Router'] should be checked in variable uniswapV2Router
        Checked variables: uniswapV2Router
            Yes The provided code is a constructor as it is explicitly named 'constructor'. Additionally, the state variable 'uniswapV2Router' is also being hardcoded
            with a specific address (0x7a250d5630B4cF539739dF2C5dAcb4c659F2488D). Thus, the function satisfies both conditions stated in the prompt.

Start analyze function: Venify.sendETH(address,uint256)
Function Security Analysis for Venify.sendETH(address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function sendETH.
    Check direct function security
        - function Venify.sendETH(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not include any checks involving msg.sender and specific roles, such as checking if msg.sender is an owner, address, leader, or CEO,
          in the form of require, if statements, or assert statements.
        - function Venify.sendETH(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code provided does not satisfy any of the specified code structures. The 'require()' statements are checking conditions related to balance and call
          success, which do not match the specified structures related to boolean variable changes.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transferFrom', '_transfer', 'transfer']
        Function Security Analysis for Venify.transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transferFrom.
            Check direct function security
                - function Venify.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: Code does not contain any sender check like require, if, throw, or assert for specific owner or leader roles.
                - function Venify.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: None of the patterns described in the given characteristics appear in the function. There is no use of 'require' or 'if' with a variable being
                  checked followed by assignment of that variable to true or false.

    Analyze External Address
        The variable 'recipient' in external call 'recipient.call{value:amount}()' has no state variable assigned in Venify.sendETH(address,uint256). Considering that it
        is an internal/private function, we analyze the function inputs.
        Analyze External Address
            There are ['buyBackWallet'] should be checked in variable buyBackWallet
            Checked variables: buyBackWallet
                State variable buyBackWallet has initialized in public area after declaration.
