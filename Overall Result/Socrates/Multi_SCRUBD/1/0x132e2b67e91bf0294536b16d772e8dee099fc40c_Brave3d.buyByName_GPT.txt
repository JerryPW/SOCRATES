Start analyze function: Brave3d.buyByName(string)
Function Security Analysis for Brave3d.buyByName(string)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function buyByName.
    Check direct function security
        - function Brave3d.buyByName(string) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not explicitly check or assert the identity of msg.sender against any xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO. Specifically, no require or
          assert statements are present ensuring that msg.sender has a specific identity related to ownership or leadership.
        - function Brave3d.buyByName(string) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does contain a `require(false);` statement, but it does not satisfy the specific structural patterns required (like setting a variable to True
          after the require statement).

Start analyze function: Brave3d.overStage(uint8)
Function Security Analysis for Brave3d.overStage(uint8)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function overStage.
    Check direct function security
        - function Brave3d.overStage(uint8) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not have any checks involving 'msg.sender' directly related to specific roles like Owner, Leader, CEO, etc. It only manipulates internal
          mappings and variables to process stages based on game logic. Therefore, it lacks any of the specified structures protecting against non-authorized senders by
          restricting them specifically to certain roles.
        - function Brave3d.overStage(uint8) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon reviewing the code, the matching structure initially thought to exist (structure 3: `require(!xxx); xxx = True;`) is not satisfied fully. The code
          contains the statement `assert(!finishStage.isFinish);`, which can be equated to `require(!xxx);`, but there's no subsequent `xxx = True;` immediately following
          this assert statement. Instead, `finishStage.isFinish = true;` appears later in the function, separated by other logic. Thus both first two statements in any of
          the specified structures are not directly sequential as required.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['setName', 'withdraw', 'forceOverStage', 'buyByName', 'buyByAddress', 'buyFromValue']
        Function Security Analysis for Brave3d.setName(string)
            The modifier of function setName are ['isExistsOfNameAddressMap', 'isExistsOfAddressNameMap']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier isExistsOfNameAddressMap has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier checks whether the address associated with the given name is zero, but does not restrict access based on the caller's address nor
                  does it involve any lock mechanism. Thus, it does not satisfy any of the listed characteristics.
                - modifier isExistsOfAddressNameMap has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The provided modifier `isExistsOfAddressNameMap` requires that the condition `bytes(_addressNameMap[msg.sender]).length<=0` is true, indicating
                  the function may depend on mappings, but does not directly enforce ownership or address-specific execution, nor does it include any locking mechanism
                  for reentrancy protection. Therefore, none of the specified characteristics are met.
            Check direct function security
                - function Brave3d.setName(string) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function doesn't include any checks or conditions involving 'msg.sender == xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO'. It uses 'msg.sender' to map
                  addresses and names, but does not impose ownership or specific address checks.
                - function Brave3d.setName(string) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The given function does not contain any of the required structures. It uses modifiers isExistsOfNameAddressMap and isExistsOfAddressNameMap, but
                  there's no require or if statement checking a condition on a variable like in the provided structures 1 to 4. The function body is primarily concerned
                  with mapping assignments and calling the overStage function. Thus, it does not satisfy any of the specified structures.
