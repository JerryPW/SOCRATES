    Check direct function security
        - function DividendPayingToken._withdrawDividendOfUser(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not have a condition checking for msg.sender's address against xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
        - function DividendPayingToken._withdrawDividendOfUser(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function does not have the require statements or the if statements with throw as outlined in any of the specified structures. It contains normal
          conditional checks and error handling through a boolean (success) without a require or throw statement.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

            Check direct function security
                - function DividendPayingToken.withdrawDividend() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The provided code snippet does not include any checks or conditions related to msg.sender against an xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO or any
                  authorization condition as described in the provided characteristics. It only uses msg.sender to pass as an argument to another function without any
                  specific checks.
                - function DividendPayingToken.withdrawDividend() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The function does not contain any of the required structures like 'require(xxx == True)', 'require(xxx == False)', or 'require(!xxx)'.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['user.call{gas:gasForTransfer,value:_withdrawableDividend}()']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - user.call{gas:gasForTransfer,value:_withdrawableDividend}() is subjected to gas limits gasForTransfer <= 3000. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here
        is the reason: In the provided code, the variable `gasForTransfer` is explicitly set to 3000 in the constructor of a contract. The constructor is executed at
        contract deployment and would set the value of `gasForTransfer` to 3000. Since there is no other function or modification within the code snippet to increase this
        value beyond 3000, the assignment to `gasForTransfer` will always result in a value less than or equal to 3000. Hence, the value is fixed at 3000 according to the
        code.
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
