Function Security Analysis for Dex.trade(uint256,ERC20,uint256,ERC20,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function trade.
    Check direct function security
        - function Dex.trade(uint256,ERC20,uint256,ERC20,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not include any direct checks involving 'msg.sender' against a specific owner or address role like xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO.
        - function Dex.trade(uint256,ERC20,uint256,ERC20,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures. It uses 'assert' and not 'require', and there are no blockers or variable changes as
          described.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['src.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),srcAmount)', 'msg.sender.send(destAmount)', 'dest.transfer(msg.sender,destAmount)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - msg.sender.send(destAmount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        'msg.sender.send(destAmount)' contains the '.send(' keyword, which satisfies one of the characteristics (contains '.send(' keyword).. Parameter in
        'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - dest.transfer(msg.sender,destAmount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - src.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),srcAmount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - dest.transfer(msg.sender,destAmount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['src.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),srcAmount)', 'dest.transfer(msg.sender,destAmount)']
    Analyze External Address
        The variable 'src' in external call 'src.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),srcAmount)' has no state variable assigned in
        Dex.trade(uint256,ERC20,uint256,ERC20,uint256). Therefore we check whether it has been hardcoded in the function.
            No The variable `src` is not hardcoded in the function. It is a parameter passed to the function `trade`, which indicates that the function expects `src` to
            be provided as an argument during the function call. No direct fixed value is assigned to `src` within the code itself, making it non-hardcoded.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
