Function Security Analysis for DCY_preICO.bringBackTokens()
    The modifier of function bringBackTokens are ['afterDeadline']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier afterDeadline has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier 'afterDeadline' does not enforce owner-only access, nor does it utilize a lock mechanism. It only checks if the current time is past the
          deadline.
    Check direct function security
        - function DCY_preICO.bringBackTokens() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code only checks if msg.sender is equal to the local variable 'beneficiary', which does not clearly adhere to the structures outlined regarding
          specific owner or authority checks.
        - function DCY_preICO.bringBackTokens() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code contains a 'require' statement but it is not followed by changing the boolean state of the same variable as per provided structures. The
          variable 'tokensLeft' used in 'require' is not changed to True or False later in the code, thus not matching any of the given structure patterns.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['tokenReward.getBalanceOf(address(this))', 'tokenReward.transfer(beneficiary,tokensLeft)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - tokenReward.transfer(beneficiary,tokensLeft) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - tokenReward.getBalanceOf(address(this)) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - tokenReward.transfer(beneficiary,tokensLeft) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['tokenReward.getBalanceOf(address(this))', 'tokenReward.transfer(beneficiary,tokensLeft)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['tokenReward'] should be checked in variable tokenReward
        Checked variables: tokenReward
            Yes The function `DCY_preICO` is a constructor because its name matches the contract name 'DCY_preICO'. Constructors typically have the same name as the
            contract in older versions of Solidity.
        There are ['tokenReward'] should be checked in variable tokenReward
        Checked variables: tokenReward
            Yes The function name 'DCY_preICO' matches the contract name, indicating that the provided code is a constructor of the contract. Furthermore, the constructor
            sets the 'tokenReward' state variable using the provided 'addressOfTokenUsedAsReward', without hardcoding it directly in the function, which means it doesn't
            violate the second characteristic.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
