Function Security Analysis for Tokens.refundTokens(address,uint256)
    The modifier of function refundTokens are ['notTimeLocked', 'stopInEmergency']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier notTimeLocked is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The modifier uses a condition to check the caller (msg.sender) against specific addresses (addressSCICO and addressSCEscrow) along with a timelock
          condition. This matches structure 1, where specific addresses are allowed to bypass a restriction. The modifier checks if msg.sender is addressSCICO or
          addressSCEscrow to bypass the timelock condition, which enforces that only these specific addresses can execute the function when the timelock is still active.
          There are no structural omissions as the decision is based on structure 1 alone, focusing on the condition involving msg.sender. There's no indication of a lock
          operation to satisfy structure 2.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
