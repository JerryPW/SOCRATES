Function Security Analysis for SOLIDBLOCK.transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function transferFrom.
    Check direct function security
        - function SOLIDBLOCK.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any checks related to 'msg.sender' being an owner, address, leader, or CEO.
        - function SOLIDBLOCK.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given function does not follow any of the specified structures. It uses a require statement to ensure that the currentAllowance is greater than or
          equal to the amount, but there are no assignments to a boolean variable immediately after, matching the specified patterns.

Start analyze function: SOLIDBLOCK._transfer(address,address,uint256)
Function Security Analysis for SOLIDBLOCK._transfer(address,address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _transfer.
    Check direct function security
        - function SOLIDBLOCK._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any checks or conditions involving `msg.sender`. It exclusively utilizes conditions that involve the parameters
          `from`, `to`, and other internal variables. The structures outlined in the criteria involve comparisons of `msg.sender` to certain roles or addresses, which are
          absent here.
        - function SOLIDBLOCK._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures. Specifically, there are no sequential `require(xxx == True/False); xxx = False/True;` or
          `if(!xxx) throw; xxx = true;` patterns. The statements primarily utilize the `require` function for various conditions without setting the same variable to
          False or True immediately afterward in the manner described.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transferFrom', 'transfer']
        Function Security Analysis for SOLIDBLOCK.transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transferFrom.
            Check direct function security
                - function SOLIDBLOCK.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function doesn't contain any check related to `msg.sender` being equal or not equal to an owner-like address.
                - function SOLIDBLOCK.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code provided checks for a condition using `require`, however, it does not change the state of a boolean variable following the requirement,
                  nor does it reflect any of the specific structures listed in the guidelines.

Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: SOLIDBLOCK.swapTokensForETH(uint256)
Function Security Analysis for SOLIDBLOCK.swapTokensForETH(uint256)
    The modifier of function swapTokensForETH are ['lockTheSwap']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier lockTheSwap is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The modifier 'lockTheSwap' matches the rule for a lock operation. Specifically, within the modifier, the flag 'swapping' is set to true before the
          placeholder for the function body and reset to false afterward, thus satisfying both the lock and unlock operation requirements to ensure the function can enter
          only once.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
