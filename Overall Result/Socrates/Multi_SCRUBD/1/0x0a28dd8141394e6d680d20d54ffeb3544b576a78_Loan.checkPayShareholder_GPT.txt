                  'require(!xxx);', or 'if(!xxx) throw;' statements, followed by modifying the same variable 'xxx'.
            Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
            There are no reachable function for internal/private function, please manually check its successor contracts.
        Function Security Analysis for Loan.userRefund()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function userRefund.
            Check direct function security
                - function Loan.userRefund() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function `userRefund` does not contain any of the specified structures that restrict function execution based on `msg.sender` being equal to
                  a specific owner or address role like Owner, CEO, etc. Thus, it does not match any of the provided criteria.
                - function Loan.userRefund() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code provided is a simple public function `userRefund()` which returns a boolean result by calling another function `_userRefund()` with
                  `msg.sender` as an argument. The function does not contain any of the specified structures since there are no `require` statements or conditional checks
                  involving a boolean variable `xxx`. Therefore, the characteristics are not met.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['shareholder.transfer(toShareHolder)', 'token.profitOrgPay.value(toShareHolder)()']
    Analyze Transfer
        - shareholder.transfer(toShareHolder) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        'shareholder.transfer(toShareHolder)' contains the '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - token.profitOrgPay.value(toShareHolder)() ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['token.profitOrgPay.value(toShareHolder)()']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['shareholder'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: shareholder
        There are no function that assign and initialize this variable. Please further manually check on successor contracts or modifiers.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
