Function Security Analysis for FarmMain._mintFarmTokenAmount(address,uint256,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _mintFarmTokenAmount.
    Check direct function security
        - function FarmMain._mintFarmTokenAmount(address,uint256,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures that restrict access based on the sender's address compared to an owner or leader address.
        - function FarmMain._mintFarmTokenAmount(address,uint256,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not have any of the specified structures (1-4) involving conditional checks ('require' or 'if') with the specific variable
          assignments before and after the checks.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['openPosition']
        Function Security Analysis for FarmMain.openPosition(FarmingPositionRequest)
            The modifier of function openPosition are ['activeSetupOnly']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier activeSetupOnly has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier 'activeSetupOnly' does not explicitly check for an owner or specific address (Rule 1) nor does it implement any lock operation
                  (Rule 2). The modifier name also doesn't imply ownership or reentrancy protection (Rule 3).
            Check direct function security
                - function FarmMain.openPosition(FarmingPositionRequest) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures where 'msg.sender' is directly compared to 'xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO', like
                  'require(msg.sender == xxxOwner)' or 'if (msg.sender != xxxOwner)'. There are no conditions that restrict access specifically based on 'msg.sender'.
                - function FarmMain.openPosition(FarmingPositionRequest) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code does not match any of the specified structures. There are no 'require' statements followed by an alteration of the same
                  variable's value, nor any if-throw statements with the specified characteristics in the detailed conditions.

    Analyze External Address
        There are ['_farmTokenCollection'] should be checked in variable _farmTokenCollection
        Checked variables: _farmTokenCollection
            No The provided function does not satisfy either of the characteristics to output 'Yes'.  1. The function `init` is not a constructor as it does not match the
            contract name 'FarmMain' and is not explicitly named 'constructor'. 2. The function does not hardcode the state variable '_farmTokenCollection'. Instead,
            '_farmTokenCollection' is assigned a value at runtime from the return of a function call, rather than being assigned a hardcoded value.
            Function Security Analysis for FarmMain.init(address,bytes,address,address,bytes)
                There are no modifiers should be examined in function init.
                Check direct function security
                    - function FarmMain.init(address,bytes,address,address,bytes) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                      Reason: The code does not contain any requirement or condition relating to the msg.sender to be an owner or address role like
                      xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO pathways.
                    - function FarmMain.init(address,bytes,address,address,bytes) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                      Reason: The code contains 'require(_factory == address(0))' but does not meet any of the specific structures defined (with a defined boolean
                      variable that is required to be true or false and then changed).
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
