Function Security Analysis for Crowdsale.buyTokens(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function buyTokens.
    Check direct function security
        - function Crowdsale.buyTokens(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified patterns related to checking if `msg.sender` equals a specific owner/address/leader/CEO.
        - function Crowdsale.buyTokens(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['token.transfer(beneficiary,tokens)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - token.transfer(beneficiary,tokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - token.transfer(beneficiary,tokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['token.transfer(beneficiary,tokens)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            Yes The function provided is named 'Crowdsale', which matches the contract name 'Crowdsale'. Therefore, it can be inferred to be a constructor based on its
            name. It initializes variables and sets initial conditions, which are typical operations in a constructor. This satisfies characteristic 1.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: Crowdsale.forwardFunds()
Function Security Analysis for Crowdsale.forwardFunds()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function forwardFunds.
    Check direct function security
        - function Crowdsale.forwardFunds() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not include any checks or conditions involving 'msg.sender'.
        - function Crowdsale.forwardFunds() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any require or conditional statements like if that checks a boolean variable and then sets it. It only contains a transfer
          function call.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['buyTokens', 'fallback']
        Function Security Analysis for Crowdsale.buyTokens(address)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function buyTokens.
            Check direct function security
                - function Crowdsale.buyTokens(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The provided function does not contain any of the specified structures checking msg.sender against a variable named xxxOwner, xxxAddress,
                  Leader, or CEO.
                - function Crowdsale.buyTokens(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not match any of the specified structures. It checks some conditions using 'require', but none of the given patterns (require with
                  specific conditions and the change of the variable later) are present.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['wallet.transfer(msg.value)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - wallet.transfer(msg.value) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains '.transfer('
        keyword which satisfies the characteristic of transferring Ether using .transfer method.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
