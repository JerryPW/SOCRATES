External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['token.balanceOf(this)', 'token.transfer(msg.sender,balance[msg.sender])']
    Analyze Transfer
        - token.transfer(msg.sender,balance[msg.sender]) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - token.balanceOf(this) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - token.transfer(msg.sender,balance[msg.sender]) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['token.balanceOf(this)', 'token.transfer(msg.sender,balance[msg.sender])']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            Yes The provided code is a constructor function because it is named 'constructor', which aligns with the typical naming for constructors in Solidity
            contracts. The function also sets up initial values for variables, which is a common behavior for constructors. Additionally, it does indeed include the state
            variable 'token', but it is not hardcoded; it is assigned from the parameter '_token'.
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            Yes The provided code is a constructor as the function is explicitly named 'constructor'.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
