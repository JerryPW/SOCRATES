Function Security Analysis for InstaDice.roll(uint8)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function roll.
    Check direct function security
        - function InstaDice.roll(uint8) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the structures checking msg.sender against a specific owner, address, or role such as Owner, Address, Leader, or CEO.
        - function InstaDice.roll(uint8) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures involving 'require' or 'if'. The closest related functionality is an 'if' statement that
          returns early if a condition is not met, but it does not include a state-altering statement after the condition check as described by the patterns.

Start analyze function: InstaDice._errorAndRefund(string,uint256,uint8)
Function Security Analysis for InstaDice._errorAndRefund(string,uint256,uint8)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _errorAndRefund.
    Check direct function security
        - function InstaDice._errorAndRefund(string,uint256,uint8) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any checks related to msg.sender being equal to an owner or specific address in any of the outlined ways.
        - function InstaDice._errorAndRefund(string,uint256,uint8) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not match any of the specified structures. It contains a `require` statement, but it checks the return value of a function call
          `msg.sender.call.value(msg.value)()` instead of a variable directly. Thus, none of the conditions for matching patterns 1 through 4 are satisfied.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['_validateBetOrRefund', 'roll']
        Function Security Analysis for InstaDice._validateBetOrRefund(uint8)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function _validateBetOrRefund.
            Check direct function security
                - function InstaDice._validateBetOrRefund(uint8) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: No condition in the code checks for 'msg.sender' against specific owners or addresses.
                - function InstaDice._validateBetOrRefund(uint8) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not satisfy any of the specified structures because it does not contain any 'require' statement for equality checks or '!xxx'
                  checks, nor does it throw an exception with an '!xxx' condition.
            Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
            The reachable functions are ['roll']
                Function Security Analysis for InstaDice.roll(uint8)
                    There are no modifiers should be examined in function roll.
                    Check direct function security
                        - function InstaDice.roll(uint8) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures related to 'msg.sender'. There are no conditions that specifically compare
                          'msg.sender' to an owner address or similar roles like Leader or CEO. The existing checks involve block numbers and betting validation.
                        - function InstaDice.roll(uint8) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                          Reason: The code does not contain any structure matching the given patterns. It contains neither 'require(xxx == True)' nor 'require(xxx ==
                          False)' nor 'require(!xxx)' nor 'if(!xxx) throw'.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['msg.sender.call.value(msg.value)()']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - msg.sender.call.value(msg.value)() ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['msg.sender.call.value(msg.value)()']
    Analyze External Address
        External call msg.sender.call.value(msg.value)() calls msg.sender, which consider potential REE problem.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
