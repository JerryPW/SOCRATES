Start analyze function: GET111.fallback()
Function Security Analysis for GET111.fallback()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
    Check direct function security
        - function GET111.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not check against msg.sender being a specific address or role like 'xxxOwner', 'xxxAddress', 'Leader', or 'CEO'.
        - function GET111.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures involving 'require' in combination with changing a variable's value between True and
          False.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['ADMIN.send(admin)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - ADMIN.send(admin) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the '.send(' keyword,
        which is one of the characteristics we are looking for.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: GET111.pay()
Function Security Analysis for GET111.pay()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function pay.
    Check direct function security
        - function GET111.pay() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any access control checks around msg.sender using structures like 'require', 'if' with 'msg.sender', or 'assert' statements
          that relate to msg.sender with certain roles or addresses.
        - function GET111.pay() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures involving the use of require statements or if statements in combination with
          true/false reassignments for the same variable. It primarily focuses on iterating through a queue to distribute balances, with conditionals regarding money and
          gas limits, without involving the specific true/false logic patterns outlined.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['fallback']
        Function Security Analysis for GET111.fallback()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
            Check direct function security
                - function GET111.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code provided does not contain any of the specified structures that check or assert the identity of msg.sender in relation to an owner or
                  other specific role. The conditional checks related to msg.sender are related to adding a deposit to a queue and sending fees, without validating sender
                  identity against an owner or similar role.
                - function GET111.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The given code does not satisfy any of the specified structures. It includes 'require' statements, but none of them use a boolean variable which
                  is then later set to a different value as described in the specified structures. The 'require' statements in this code are simple condition checks
                  without any state transition for a boolean variable.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['dep.depositor.send(dep.expect)', 'dep.depositor.send(money)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - dep.depositor.send(dep.expect) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains '.send('
        keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - dep.depositor.send(money) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains '.send('
        keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
