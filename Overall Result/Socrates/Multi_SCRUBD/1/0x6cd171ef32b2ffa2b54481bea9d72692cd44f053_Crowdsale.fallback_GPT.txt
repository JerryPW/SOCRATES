    There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
    Check direct function security
        - function Crowdsale.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures related to checking msg.sender.
        - function Crowdsale.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any require statement directly followed by an assignment to the same variable, as outlined in the given structures. There is a
          'require(tokenToBuy > 0);' but no tokenToBuy assignment immediately following or elsewhere in the structure to make it satisfy the conditions.

    Analyze Transfer
        - sharesTokenAddress.transfer(msg.sender,tokenFree) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - msg.sender.transfer(msg.value-sendETH) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call contains
        '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - owner.transfer(actualETHTransfer) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call contains '.transfer('
        keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - sharesTokenAddress.transfer(msg.sender,tokenToBuy) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - msg.sender.transfer(msg.value-actualETHTransfer) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call contains
        '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - owner.transfer(sendETH) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call contains '.transfer(' keyword..
        Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - msg.sender.transfer(msg.value) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call contains '.transfer('
        keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - sharesTokenAddress.balanceOf(this) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - sharesTokenAddress.transfer(msg.sender,tokenFree) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - sharesTokenAddress.transfer(msg.sender,tokenToBuy) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['sharesTokenAddress.balanceOf(this)', 'sharesTokenAddress.transfer(msg.sender,tokenFree)',
    'sharesTokenAddress.transfer(msg.sender,tokenToBuy)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['sharesTokenAddress'] should be checked in variable sharesTokenAddress
        Checked variables: sharesTokenAddress
            Yes The provided function is named "Crowdsale", which matches the contract name "Crowdsale" given in the prompt. This indicates that the function is a
            constructor, which satisfies the first characteristic for the judgment.
        There are ['sharesTokenAddress'] should be checked in variable sharesTokenAddress
        Checked variables: sharesTokenAddress
            Yes The function name 'Crowdsale' matches the contract name 'Crowdsale', indicating that it is a constructor. This satisfies the first characteristic.
        There are ['sharesTokenAddress'] should be checked in variable sharesTokenAddress
        Checked variables: sharesTokenAddress
            Yes The function 'Crowdsale' has the same name as the contract 'Crowdsale', which indicates that it is a constructor. In Solidity, constructors are special
            functions that are automatically executed when a contract is deployed. Thus, the function meets the first characteristic of being a constructor.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
