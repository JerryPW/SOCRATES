    Check direct function security
        - function DappIncubator.transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain a direct check of msg.sender against predefined ownership roles such as xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO. It requires
          validation of contract addresses and wallet addresses but does not relate to ownership validation based on msg.sender.
        - function DappIncubator.transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code contains a `require(contractAddressRecord[contractAddress] == true);` followed by conditions where `walletAddressRecord[toAddress]` can be set
          to `true` if it was initially `false`. Although there are multiple `require` statements, none of them specifically checks a boolean variable alone and then
          flips it, which is required to match the given structures.

Function Security Analysis for DappIncubator.withdraw(address)
    The modifier of function withdraw are ['nonReentrant']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier nonReentrant is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The code checks for both the lock and unlock operations:  1. `require(_status != _ENTERED, "ReentrancyGuard: reentrant call");` ensures the function is
          not already entered, which is part of the lock mechanism. 2. `_status = _ENTERED;` sets the flag to an entered state, completing the lock. 3. The presence of
          `_status = _NOT_ENTERED;` after the execution of the function ensures the unlock operation. Thus, rule 2 is fully met.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
