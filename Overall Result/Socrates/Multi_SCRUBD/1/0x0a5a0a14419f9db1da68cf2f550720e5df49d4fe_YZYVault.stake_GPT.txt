    There are no modifiers should be examined in function stake.
    Check direct function security
        - function YZYVault.stake() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the required structures involving checks or assertions against msg.sender related to ownership or specific roles.
        - function YZYVault.stake() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon review, the code contains 'require(!isContract(_msgSender()), ...);' which matches the first part of structure 3, but it does not contain
          'isContract = True;' thereafter, which means both the required components of structure 3 are not met. Therefore, the code does not fully satisfy any of the
          specified structures.

    Check direct function security
        - function YZYVault.claimSwapReward() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures as it neither checks msg.sender against any xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO variable or
          condition, nor uses require/assert with these conditions.
        - function YZYVault.claimSwapReward() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code lacks any of the specified structural requirements; it doesn't use require or if(!xxx) throw statements.

        There are ['_yzy'] should be checked in variable _yzy
        Checked variables: _yzy
            No The provided function is not a constructor because the function name does not match the contract name 'YZYVault', and it is not explicitly named
            'constructor'. Additionally, the function does not hardcode the state variable '_yzy'. Instead, it assigns '_yzy' the value passed as an argument 'yzy'.
            Therefore, neither characteristic is satisfied.
            Function Security Analysis for YZYVault.changeYzyAddress(address)
                The modifier of function changeYzyAddress are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The modifier "onlyOwner" contains the statement "require(_owner == _msgSender(), "Ownable: caller is not the owner");" which checks whether
                      the caller is the owner. This matches rule 1, hence satisfying the condition without omission. There is no indication of a locking mechanism
                      indicating rule 2, and the naming convention already aligns with known patterns from rule 3 like "Onlyxxx".
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

    Check direct function security
        - function YZYVault._sendLotteryAmount() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any checks or assertions for msg.sender against any specific owner, address, Leader, or CEO variables as specified in the
          given criteria. It seems to be handling business logic without restriction based on the caller's identity.
        - function YZYVault._sendLotteryAmount() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function _sendLotteryAmount contains an if condition that checks !_enabledLottery, which follows the pattern of !xxx, but it does not proceed to set
          xxx to true or false. Hence none of the outlined patterns in the rules are matched.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

                - function YZYVault.claimSwapReward() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function 'claimSwapReward' does not contain any of the specified structures involving msg.sender compared to xxOwner/xxAddress/Leader/CEO.
                - function YZYVault.claimSwapReward() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not require any condition that specifically forces a variable to be true or false, nor does it throw when a variable is false.
                  Hence, it doesn't match any of the provided structures.

            No The provided code is not a constructor because the function name 'changeYzyAddress' does not match the contract name 'YZYVault' and it is not named
            'constructor'. Also, the code is mutating the state variable _yzy with an external input parameter meaning there is no hardcoded assignment of the state
            variable _yzy in the function body, hence it doesn't satisfy the second characteristic.

                The modifier of function changeYzyAddress are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The code contains a 'require' statement that checks whether '_owner' is equal to '_msgSender()', which ensures that only the owner can
                      execute the function, satisfying characteristic 1. There are no structural omissions as the entire condition for characteristic 1 is met.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

    Check direct function security
        - function YZYVault.claimYzyReward() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not have any checks related to msg.sender being an owner, address, leader, or CEO. It only checks if the msg.sender has available or
          pending rewards and manages their transfer accordingly.
        - function YZYVault.claimYzyReward() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given function does not contain any of the specified code structures. The code has 'require' statements but none of them are followed by statements
          setting the same variable to 'False' or 'True'. Additionally, the 'require' statements check conditions unrelated to setting variables directly as outlined in
          the structures.

        Checked variables: _yzy
            No The provided code is a function named `changeYzyAddress`, which is not a constructor since its name does not match the contract name 'YZYVault' and it is
            not explicitly named 'constructor'. Additionally, this function does not hardcode the state variable `_yzy`. The state variable `_yzy` is set dynamically to
            an external address passed as a parameter `yzy`, not hardcoded to a specific address or constant value within the function body.
            Function Security Analysis for YZYVault.changeYzyAddress(address)
                The modifier of function changeYzyAddress are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The code in the `onlyOwner` modifier enforces that only the owner can execute the function by using `require(_owner == _msgSender(), ...)`
                      which matches rule 1. There are no lock operations in the code indicating it doesn't match rule 2. The match is based purely on rule 1 as there are
                      no mentions of locking or unlocking mechanisms, and the modifier's logic directly involves ownership verification.

                  address.
                - function YZYVault.stake() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: Upon re-evaluation, the code does contain the statement 'require(!isContract(_msgSender()), ...)', which matches the first part of structure 3.
                  However, the subsequent part where 'xxx = True;' is not present. Without both components, the pattern does not fully match any of the given structures.

    Check direct function security
        - function YZYVault._swapAndClaimTokens(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not check the identity of the caller like 'msg.sender == xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO' or 'msg.sender !=
          xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO'. It only performs logical operations and token swaps without verifying the caller against a specific address or role.
        - function YZYVault._swapAndClaimTokens(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code doesn't match any of the required structures. In this function, there are multiple require statements used for validation, but none of them
          involve a boolean variable being switched between true and false as specified in the given patterns.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

        - function YZYVault.safeYzyTransfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any 'require' statements or 'if' statements with 'throw'. It doesn't follow any of the specified structures where a

                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The modifier 'onlyOwner' contains the statement 'require(_owner == _msgSender())', which checks if the caller is the owner before allowing
                      execution. This aligns with rule 1, ensuring only specific addresses (the owner) can execute the function.
        There are ['_yzy'] should be checked in variable _yzy
        Checked variables: _yzy
            No The function is named 'changeYzyAddress', which is different from the contract name 'YZYVault' and it is not explicitly named 'constructor'. Therefore, it
            doesn't satisfy the first characteristic.   Additionally, the code does not show any hardcoded values for the state variable '_yzy'; instead, it receives a
            parameter 'yzy' from the user input and assigns it, meaning the value is dynamic and not hardcoded.  Thus, the function satisfies none of the given
            conditions.

                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The code in the modifier `onlyOwner` enforces that only the owner can execute the function by using the statement `require(_owner ==
                      _msgSender(), "Ownable: caller is not the owner")`. This matches the rule of checking whether the code enforces that only the owner can execute the

                    Check direct function security
                        - function YZYVault.stake() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                          Reason: The code does not check if msg.sender matches any owner or leader roles. It mainly checks for contract status and minimum deposit
                          amount.
                        - function YZYVault.stake() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                          Reason: The function contains `require(!isContract(_msgSender()), "Vault: Could not be contract.")`, which matches the first part of structure 3
                          `{require(!xxx);} `. However, the second required part, `xxx = True;` is not present in the code, thus the code does not fulfill the conditions
                          of the stated structure. Therefore, no full structure is matched.

            There are ['_yzy'] should be checked in variable _yzy
            Checked variables: _yzy
                No 1. The function 'changeYzyAddress' does not match the contract name 'YZYVault' and is not explicitly named 'constructor', so it is not a constructor.
                2. The function modifies the state variable '_yzy', but it does not assign a hardcoded value to it. Instead, it takes a parameter 'yzy' and changes '_yzy'
                dynamically based on that. Therefore, none of the characteristics are satisfied.
            Function Security Analysis for YZYVault.changeYzyAddress(address)
                The modifier of function changeYzyAddress are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The code contains a require statement that checks if _owner is equal to _msgSender(). This matches the first characteristic of enforcing
                      that only the owner or specific addresses can execute the function.
            There are ['_weth'] should be checked in variable _weth
            Checked variables: _weth
                Yes The provided code is a constructor of the YZYVault contract, as indicated by the use of the 'constructor' keyword, which initializes state variables.
                The state variable '_weth' is passed as a parameter and assigned to a variable within the constructor, hence it is not hardcoded directly in the code.
            There are ['_weth'] should be checked in variable _weth
            Checked variables: _weth
                Yes The code provided is a constructor since the function name is 'constructor'. This satisfies the first characteristic, meaning it doesn't require
                checking the state variable since the constructor condition alone qualifies the code.
        There are ['_uniswapV2Router'] should be checked in variable _uniswapV2Router
        Checked variables: _uniswapV2Router
            Yes The code provided is a constructor for the contract YZYVault. The function is explicitly named 'constructor', which matches the first characteristic for
            satisfaction.  Moreover, the state variable '_uniswapV2Router' is set to a hardcoded address within the constructor, satisfying the second characteristic
            regarding state variables.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
