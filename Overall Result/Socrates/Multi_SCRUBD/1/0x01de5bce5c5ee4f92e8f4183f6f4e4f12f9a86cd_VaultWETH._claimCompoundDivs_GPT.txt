Function Security Analysis for VaultWETH._claimCompoundDivs()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _claimCompoundDivs.
    Check direct function security
        - function VaultWETH._claimCompoundDivs() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not have any checks involving the identity of msg.sender against a specific address designated as an owner, address, leader, or CEO.
        - function VaultWETH._claimCompoundDivs() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not have any of the specified structures. It includes conditional checks and balances calculations without any of the specified
          patterns.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['claim', 'claimCompoundDivs']
        Function Security Analysis for VaultWETH.claim(uint256)
            The modifier of function claim are ['noContractsAllowed', 'nonReentrant']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier noContractsAllowed has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier checks if the transaction origin is equal to the message sender, but it does not explicitly restrict execution to the owner or
                  specific addresses, nor does it include a lock mechanism. It restricts contract calls, but this is not explicitly one of the rules listed for decision
                  making.
                - modifier nonReentrant is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The modifier 'nonReentrant' uses a lock mechanism by setting '_status = _ENTERED;' to prevent reentrant calls, followed by unlocking it with
                  '_status = _NOT_ENTERED;'. This satisfies both the lock and unlock conditions required by rule number 2.
        Function Security Analysis for VaultWETH.claimCompoundDivs()
            The modifier of function claimCompoundDivs are ['noContractsAllowed', 'nonReentrant']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier noContractsAllowed has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier enforces that only externally owned accounts (EOA) and not contracts can execute the function. This indirectly ensures a level of
                  access control by preventing contracts from calling the function, but it does not enforce ownership or specific address control, nor does it involve a
                  lock mechanism. Thus, it doesn't meet the characteristics mentioned.
                - modifier nonReentrant is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The code enforces a lock operation by setting `_status = _ENTERED;` and unlocks it by `_status = _NOT_ENTERED;` to ensure the function enters
                  only once, satisfying characteristic 2 completely.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
