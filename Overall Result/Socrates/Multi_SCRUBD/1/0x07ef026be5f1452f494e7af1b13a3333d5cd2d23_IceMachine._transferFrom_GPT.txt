Function Security Analysis for IceMachine._transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _transferFrom.
    Check direct function security
        - function IceMachine._transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code provided does not contain any structures listed in the given characteristics for operation checks based on msg.sender.
        - function IceMachine._transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any structure of the form specified. It uses 'require' but not with a direct boolean check followed by setting that boolean
          variable.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transfer', 'transferFrom']
        Function Security Analysis for IceMachine.transfer(address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transfer.
            Check direct function security
                - function IceMachine.transfer(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not have any condition that directly checks for specific identity or role associated with msg.sender, such as checking if
                  msg.sender is an owner or leader.
                - function IceMachine.transfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code does not match any of the specified structures. There are no require statements, condition checks with throw, or assignments
                  to a variable named 'xxx' or similar with the specified structures.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['distributor.setShare(recipient,_balances[recipient])', 'distributor.process(distributorGas)',
    'distributor.setShare(sender,_balances[sender])']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - distributor.setShare(recipient,_balances[recipient]) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - distributor.process(distributorGas) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Here is the reason: The provided variables and functions suggest there's a constraint placed
        on the `distributorGas` variable in two parts of the code.  1. The variable `distributorGas` is initialized with a value of `500000` in the given code (i.e.,
        `uint256 distributorGas = 500000;`). This value is already less than or equal to 3000.  2. There is a function `setDistributorSettings` which sets the
        `distributorGas` variable with a new value determined by the method's parameter `gas`. Inside this function, there is a requirement check: `require(gas <
        750000);`. This requirement ensures that the gas value used to update `distributorGas` is always less than 750,000.  Thus, the implementation ensures that
        `distributorGas` is less than 750,000. However, since the validation for being less than or equal to 3000 is not explicitly performed or guaranteed by the code
        logic or constraints, `distributorGas` could be greater than 3000 if values between 3000 and 750,000 are permitted by any caller authorized to invoke
        `setDistributorSettings`. Therefore, while the initial value is set to be less than or equal to 3000, there is no such guarantee after using the
        `setDistributorSettings` function.   Hence, the assignment to `distributorGas` is not guaranteed to be less than or equal to 3000 at all times, which leads to a
        conclusion of False.
        - distributor.setShare(sender,_balances[sender]) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['distributor.setShare(recipient,_balances[recipient])', 'distributor.process(distributorGas)',
    'distributor.setShare(sender,_balances[sender])']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['distributor'] should be checked in variable distributor
        Checked variables: distributor
            Yes The function in the provided code is a constructor because it is explicitly named 'constructor'. According to the rules, if the code is a constructor, the
            external call satisfies characteristic 1.
        There are ['distributor'] should be checked in variable distributor
        Checked variables: distributor
            Yes The provided code is a constructor function for the contract named "IceMachine". Constructors in Solidity are special functions that are only executed
            when a contract is created and are used to initialize contract data. In this case, the constructor is used to initialize various state variables and conduct
            setup for the contract, including assigning the "distributor" state variable with a new instance of the "DividendDistributor". Thus, the external call
            satisfies the constructor characteristic.
        There are ['distributor'] should be checked in variable distributor
        Checked variables: distributor
            Yes The function in the provided code is explicitly named 'constructor', making it a constructor function. This satisfies the first characteristic mentioned
            in the problem statement, where you need to check if the provided code is a constructor.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: IceMachine.swapBack()
Function Security Analysis for IceMachine.swapBack()
    The modifier of function swapBack are ['swapping']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier swapping is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The modifier 'swapping' sets 'inSwap' to true before the execution of the function and resets it to false afterward. Both lock (setting inSwap to true)
          and unlock (resetting inSwap to false) operations are present, ensuring the function enters only once.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: IceMachine.triggerAutoBuyback()
Function Security Analysis for IceMachine.triggerAutoBuyback()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function triggerAutoBuyback.
    Check direct function security
        - function IceMachine.triggerAutoBuyback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any require or assert statements involving msg.sender, nor does it have any if conditions checking msg.sender.
        - function IceMachine.triggerAutoBuyback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not have any of the specified structures such as checking a condition using 'require' or 'if' with the specified operations on a
          boolean variable as described.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

                  Reason: The code does not contain any checks regarding msg.sender against xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO.
                - function IceMachine._transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not match any of the specified structures as it does not contain 'require(xxx == True); xxx = False;', 'require(xxx == False); xxx
                  = True;', 'require(!xxx); xxx = True;', or 'if(!xxx) throw; xxx = true;'.
            Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

                    Check direct function security
                        - function IceMachine.transfer(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified require, if, or assert statements related to checking msg.sender against an owner or
                          specific address.
                        - function IceMachine.transfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                          Reason: The given code snippet does not involve any 'require' or 'if' statements that check the truthiness of a variable and then change its
                          value to either true or false. Thus, it does not match any of the defined structure patterns given to determine a 'Yes'.

    The modifier of function buyTokens are ['swapping']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier swapping is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
