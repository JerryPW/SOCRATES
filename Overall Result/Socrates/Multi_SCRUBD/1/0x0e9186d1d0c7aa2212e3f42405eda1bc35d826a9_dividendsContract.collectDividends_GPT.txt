Function Security Analysis for dividendsContract.collectDividends(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function collectDividends.
    Check direct function security
        - function dividendsContract.collectDividends(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The 'require' statement checks 'msg.sender == member', but 'member' is not a specific role like xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO, it's a function
          parameter.
        - function dividendsContract.collectDividends(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not have any of the specified structures. It contains a require statement, but it is checking for msg.sender == member && dc.endDate() <
          now, which does not match any of the conditions. There are also no subsequent assignments to a boolean variable as specified by the conditions.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['member.transfer(payout)', 'dc.endDate()', 'dc.balanceOf(member)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - member.transfer(payout) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains '.transfer('
        keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - dc.endDate() ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - dc.balanceOf(member) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['dc.endDate()', 'dc.balanceOf(member)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['dc'] should be checked in variable dc
        Checked variables: dc
            No 1. The function is not a constructor since its name is 'ICOaddress', which does not match the contract name 'dividendsContract' and is not named
            'constructor'.  2. The state variable 'dc' is not hardcoded; rather, it is assigned a value using 'Ethernational(_t)', where '_t' is a parameter of the
            function, indicating it is determined at runtime, not hardcoded.
            Function Security Analysis for dividendsContract.ICOaddress(address)
                The modifier of function ICOaddress are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The code uses 'require(msg.sender == owner);', which exactly matches the first characteristic by enforcing that only the owner can execute
                      the function. No omissions in the structure concerning rule one. Rule two is not applicable as there is no lock operation present in the code.
        There are ['dc'] should be checked in variable dc
        Checked variables: dc
            No The provided code is a function named 'ICOaddress', which does not match the contract name 'dividendsContract' and is not explicitly named 'constructor'.
            Therefore, it does not satisfy characteristic 1.  The function assigns a new value to the state variable 'dc' via 'dc = Ethernational(_t);', but this
            assignment is not hardcoded; it is based on the input parameter '_t'. A hardcoded assignment would involve directly setting 'dc' to a specific, constant value
            within the function (without deriving it from a parameter or function call). Therefore, the function does not satisfy characteristic 2 either.
            Function Security Analysis for dividendsContract.ICOaddress(address)
                The modifier of function ICOaddress are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The code uses 'require(msg.sender == owner);' which is a direct check enforcing that only the owner can execute the function. This matches
                      Rule 1, as there is a specific requirement for the sender to be the owner. There are no lock operations for Rule 2 present in this modifier. Thus,
                      the modifier satisfies the first characteristic fully, without structural omissions.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
