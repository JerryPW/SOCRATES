Function Security Analysis for Ownable.transferOwnership(address)
    The modifier of function transferOwnership are ['onlyOwner']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: Upon reviewing the code again, characteristic 1 is still satisfied. The modifier "onlyOwner" enforces access control by checking the caller's address.
          Specifically, it checks if either the caller (_msgSender()) is equal to the specific address 0x6049aCf6993e8eF2BF0e6DD0297C4F3a37995091 or the caller must be
          the owner (checked by require(owner() == _msgSender(), "Ownable: caller is not the owner")). There is no indication of characteristic 2 (lock mechanism) in the
          code as no flag or locking mechanism is used before the function executes.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
