Function Security Analysis for bebBUYtwo.setVoteFandui()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function setVoteFandui.
    Check direct function security
        - function bebBUYtwo.setVoteFandui() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The provided code snippet does not contain any of the specified structures with require, if/else, or assert checks that involve 'msg.sender' against any
          'xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO'. It only uses 'require' to check a boolean variable 'KAIGUAN' and a token balance check.
        - function bebBUYtwo.setVoteFandui() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: This code contains the 'require(KAIGUAN);' statement at the beginning but does not have the corresponding switching of 'KAIGUAN' in an opposite boolean
          context that satisfies any of the four described structures. The end of the code does set 'KAIGUAN=false;' but without the context where both statements meet
          the criteria of either structure 1 or structure 2.

        - bebTokenTransferBET.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),_value) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['bebTokenTransferBET.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),_value)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['bebTokenTransferBET'] should be checked in variable bebTokenTransferBET
        Checked variables: bebTokenTransferBET
            Yes 1. The function name 'bebBUYtwo' matches the contract name 'bebBUYtwo', indicating it's likely a constructor. 2. The state variable 'bebTokenTransferBET'
            is clearly being assigned a hardcoded value derived from the parameter '_BETadderss'.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: bebBUYtwo.getTokenBalanceBET(address)
Function Security Analysis for bebBUYtwo.getTokenBalanceBET(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function getTokenBalanceBET.
    Check direct function security
        - function bebBUYtwo.getTokenBalanceBET(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The provided function does not involve any checks or conditions revolving around 'msg.sender'. It simply returns the balance of a given address, so none
          of the required structures involving msg.sender ownership are present.
        - function bebBUYtwo.getTokenBalanceBET(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures with 'require' or 'if' statements for setting a variable to true or false.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['bebTokenTransferBET.balanceOf(_addr)']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - bebTokenTransferBET.balanceOf(_addr) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['bebTokenTransferBET.balanceOf(_addr)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['bebTokenTransferBET'] should be checked in variable bebTokenTransferBET
        Checked variables: bebTokenTransferBET
            Yes 1. The code provided is a function named 'bebBUYtwo', which matches the given contract name 'bebBUYtwo'. Therefore, it satisfies the first characteristic
            as a constructor. 2. The state variable 'bebTokenTransferBET' is being assigned using a function call to 'tokenTransferBET(_BETadderss)', which is not
            hardcoded. Therefore, it does not satisfy the second characteristic.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
