Function Security Analysis for EtherRolling.withdraw(uint8)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function withdraw.
    Check direct function security
        - function EtherRolling.withdraw(uint8) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not implement any checks based on the condition of the caller's address being specific owners, addresses, leader, or CEO as stated in the
          required characteristics. The function checks and performs operations based on the payouts, bonuses, and other business logic but not on the identity of
          msg.sender related to ownership or leadership roles.
        - function EtherRolling.withdraw(uint8) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: This function does not have any structure matching the provided characteristics. It contains a require statement, but it does not change the state of
          any boolean variables immediately before or after the require statement. It checks if 'to_payout' > 0 but does not involve toggling a boolean variable around
          the check.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['_token.send(msg.sender,to_payout,TokenWithdrawed)', 'address(msg.sender).transfer(to_payout)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - _token.send(msg.sender,to_payout,TokenWithdrawed) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 3.
        - address(msg.sender).transfer(to_payout) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains
        '.transfer(' keyword, fulfilling one of the specified characteristics.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - _token.send(msg.sender,to_payout,TokenWithdrawed) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['_token.send(msg.sender,to_payout,TokenWithdrawed)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['_token'] should be checked in variable _token
        Checked variables: _token
            Yes The provided code snippet is a constructor since it is explicitly named 'constructor'. Constructors are special functions in Solidity that are executed
            once when the contract is deployed and are used for initializations. Therefore, it satisfies the first characteristic.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
