Function Security Analysis for PunkMonkeyDividendTracker._reinvestDividendOfUser(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _reinvestDividendOfUser.
    Check direct function security
        - function PunkMonkeyDividendTracker._reinvestDividendOfUser(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any checks involving msg.sender or any access control mechanisms using msg.sender. It only performs dividend operations
          without verifying the sender's identity against an owner or leadership address, which does not match any of the specified patterns.
        - function PunkMonkeyDividendTracker._reinvestDividendOfUser(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function doesn't have a requirement or assumption of a boolean variable being true or false and then changing its state. It doesn't match any of the
          specified structures involving require or if statements followed by boolean value changes.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['processAccount', 'process']
        Function Security Analysis for PunkMonkeyDividendTracker.processAccount(address,bool)
            The modifier of function processAccount are ['onlyOwner']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The code contains require(_owner == _msgSender(), "Ownable: caller is not the owner"), which satisfies the condition to check that only the
                  owner can execute the function.
        Function Security Analysis for PunkMonkeyDividendTracker.process(uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function process.
            Check direct function security
                - function PunkMonkeyDividendTracker.process(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any conditional checks or assertions involving msg.sender and xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO. It mostly processes
                  token holder accounts and checks conditions related to gas and account processing status.
                - function PunkMonkeyDividendTracker.process(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code provided does not match any of the specified patterns.

    Analyze External Address
        There are ['PunkMonkeyContract'] should be checked in variable PunkMonkeyContract
        Checked variables: PunkMonkeyContract
            Yes The provided code is a constructor, as indicated by the use of the keyword 'constructor'. This satisfies the first characteristic for judging 'Yes'.
        There are ['uniswapV2Router'] should be checked in variable uniswapV2Router
        Checked variables: uniswapV2Router
            Yes The provided code includes a constructor for a contract named PunkMonkeyDividendTracker, as indicated by both the explicit use of the 'constructor'
            keyword and the fact that it matches the characteristics of a constructor. This satisfies the first characteristic of checking whether the provided code is a
            constructor.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
