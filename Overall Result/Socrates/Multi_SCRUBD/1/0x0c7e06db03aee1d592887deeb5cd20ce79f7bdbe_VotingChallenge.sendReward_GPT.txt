Function Security Analysis for VotingChallenge.sendReward(address)
    The modifier of function sendReward are ['afterVotingPeriod']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier afterVotingPeriod has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier does not demonstrate any control over the sender's address or implement any lock operation explicitly. There are no references to ownership
          or specific addresses nor any flag set as a lock operation.
    Check direct function security
        - function VotingChallenge.sendReward(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures related to checking or asserting msg.sender against an owner, leader, or CEO address.
        - function VotingChallenge.sendReward(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided function does not contain any of the specified structures involving conditions with variables and altering their boolean states.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['forwarder.forward.value(sum)(referrer2,to)', 'forwarder.forward.value(sum)(referrer1,to)', 'to.transfer(reward+voters[to].fullVotes[winner])']
    Analyze Transfer
        - to.transfer(reward+voters[to].fullVotes[winner]) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call contains
        '.transfer(' keyword, which satisfies the condition.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - forwarder.forward.value(sum)(referrer2,to) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - forwarder.forward.value(sum)(referrer1,to) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['forwarder.forward.value(sum)(referrer2,to)', 'forwarder.forward.value(sum)(referrer1,to)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['forwarder'] should be checked in variable forwarder
        Checked variables: forwarder
            Yes The provided code is a constructor because the function does not have a name typical for Solidity functions and contains the 'constructor' keyword, which
            explicitly defines a constructor in Solidity. Constructors are special functions that are only executed once when the contract is deployed. Therefore, the
            external call in this code is a constructor call.
        There are ['forwarder'] should be checked in variable forwarder
        Checked variables: forwarder
            Yes The provided function is a constructor because its name is 'constructor', which explicitly indicates it is used for contract initialization.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
