Function Security Analysis for Crowdsale.fallback()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
    Check direct function security
        - function Crowdsale.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The given function does not check for any specific address or ownership in the form of msg.sender. It only checks if the crowdsale is closed before
          proceeding with the transaction.
        - function Crowdsale.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon reviewing the code, the snippet does contain the `require(!crowdsaleClosed);` which matches the first part of the third structure `require(!xxx);`.
          However, the second required condition xxx = True; is not present in the code. Therefore, the code does not fully satisfy the structure requirement as both
          elements are necessary for a complete match.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['beneficiary.send(amount)', 'tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,sendTokens)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - beneficiary.send(amount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains '.send('
        keyword, hence it satisfies the condition of containing '.send('.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,sendTokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,sendTokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,sendTokens)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['tokenReward'] should be checked in variable tokenReward
        Checked variables: tokenReward
            Yes The function 'Crowdsale()' matches the contract name 'Crowdsale', indicating that it is a constructor. Constructors are special functions that are
            executed during the deployment of a contract and typically do not have a return value.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
