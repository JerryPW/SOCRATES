Function Security Analysis for Dex.tradeRoutes(ERC20,uint256,ERC20,uint256,address[])
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function tradeRoutes.
    Check direct function security
        - function Dex.tradeRoutes(ERC20,uint256,ERC20,uint256,address[]) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not include any of the specified structures related to checking msg.sender identity (such as 'require', 'if', 'assert' with
          msg.sender).
        - function Dex.tradeRoutes(ERC20,uint256,ERC20,uint256,address[]) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not contain any of the required structures specified. It does not have a `require` or `if` statement that checks a condition and
          then sets the same variable to `True` or `False`. The only `assert` checks a condition (not related to our structure) without changing a variable in the
          specified manner.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['src.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),srcAmount)', 'msg.sender.send(destAmount)', 'dest.transfer(msg.sender,destAmount)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - msg.sender.send(destAmount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: This external call contains the '.send('
        keyword, which satisfies the criteria.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - src.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),srcAmount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - dest.transfer(msg.sender,destAmount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['src.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),srcAmount)', 'dest.transfer(msg.sender,destAmount)']
    Analyze External Address
        The variable 'src' in external call 'src.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),srcAmount)' has no state variable assigned in
        Dex.tradeRoutes(ERC20,uint256,ERC20,uint256,address[]). Therefore we check whether it has been hardcoded in the function.
            No The variable 'src' is passed as a parameter to the function 'tradeRoutes'. It is used within the function without replacing its value with a constant. This
            means the function utilizes the 'src' value dynamically based on what is provided when the function is called.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
