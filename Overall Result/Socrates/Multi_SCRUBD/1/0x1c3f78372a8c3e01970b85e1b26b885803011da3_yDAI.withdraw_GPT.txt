Function Security Analysis for yDAI.withdraw(uint256)
    The modifier of function withdraw are ['nonReentrant', 'noContract']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier nonReentrant is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The modifier uses a counter mechanism to ensure that the function can be entered only once at a time. Specifically, the counter '_guardCounter' is
          incremented at the start, and after the function executes, it checks if the local counter equals '_guardCounter'. If not, it implies reentrancy, thus both lock
          (increment) and unlock (check equality to ensure no change) operations are present.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
