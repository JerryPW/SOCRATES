Function Security Analysis for LetsBreakThings.checkBalanceSendEth(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function checkBalanceSendEth.
    Check direct function security
        - function LetsBreakThings.checkBalanceSendEth(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code has a line 'require(creator == msg.sender, "unauthorized");'. Although 'creator' could be a reference to an owner or authorized role, according
          to the provided criteria, the structure requires 'msg.sender' to be explicitly compared to 'xxxOwner', 'xxxAddress', 'Leader', or 'CEO'. In this context,
          'creator' does not strictly qualify as such terms. Hence, the code does not meet any of the specified structures required for outputting 'Yes'.
        - function LetsBreakThings.checkBalanceSendEth(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code provided does not contain any of the identifiable structures outlined, such as using require statements with specific variable assignments or
          conditional throw statements in coordination with variable settings. It is primarily composed of function calls, such as 'checkBalance' and
          '_recipient.transfer', without the requisite conditional modifications of variables.
