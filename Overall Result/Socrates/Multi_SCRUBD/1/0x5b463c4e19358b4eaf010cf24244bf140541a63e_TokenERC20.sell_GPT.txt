    There are no modifiers should be examined in function sell.
    Check direct function security
        - function TokenERC20.sell(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the required patterns or structures that involve checking if msg.sender is equal or not equal to any ownership or
          leadership variable/constant like xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO.
        - function TokenERC20.sell(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon reviewing the code again, the structure 'if (!xxx) throw' checks 'if (balanceOf[msg.sender] < amount)', but the second required statement 'xxx =
          true;' does not appear in the code in relation to 'balanceOf[msg.sender]'. Therefore, the full structure of condition 4 is not satisfied as there is only the
          'if (!xxx) throw' part without the accompanying 'xxx = true;' line.
