    Check direct function security
        - function JINJAINU.ContractTransfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code contains checks for various conditions and restrictions on transfers but does not contain any checks or assertions specifically for comparing
          msg.sender to xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO as described in the specified characteristics.
        - function JINJAINU.ContractTransfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures. There are no statements where a requirement check is followed by direct manipulation
          of the same variable to change its boolean state as per the given patterns.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transferFrom', 'transfer', 'withdrawStuckTokens']
        Function Security Analysis for JINJAINU.transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transferFrom.
            Check direct function security
                - function JINJAINU.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain any access control checks related to msg.sender being a specific owner, address, leader, or CEO.
                - function JINJAINU.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code provided does not contain any of the required structures for outputting 'Yes'. It lacks a require statement or an if statement with a
                  throw that checks whether a variable (xxx) is true or false, followed by an assignment that changes the state of xxx.

Start analyze function: JINJAINU.taxTokenSwap()
Function Security Analysis for JINJAINU.taxTokenSwap()
    The modifier of function taxTokenSwap are ['lockTheSwap']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier lockTheSwap is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: Upon reviewing the provided modifier code, it is confirmed there is a lock operation structure present: the flag 'isal' is set to true before the
          function runs ('isal = true;') and is reset to false right after ('isal = false;'). Both lock and unlock operations are present, confirming it fully meets the
          structural requirements of Rule 2.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
