Function Security Analysis for BrokerV2.bid(uint256,address,uint256)
    The modifier of function bid are ['onSaleOnly', 'activeAuction']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier onSaleOnly has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier does not enforce that only the owner or specific addresses can execute the function, nor does it use any lock operation to ensure the
          function runs only once. It only checks if a token is open for sale, which does not satisfy any of the characteristics outlined in the prompt.
        - modifier activeAuction has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The code in the modifier does not enforce any owner or specific address checks, nor does it have a lock operation. It also does not use any indicative
          function names like Onlyxxx or nonReentrant. Therefore, it doesn't meet any of the characteristics to ensure restricted access or re-entrancy protection.
    Check direct function security
        - function BrokerV2.bid(uint256,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures that check if the caller (msg.sender) is the owner, address, leader, or CEO before
          performing actions. It primarily verifies bidding conditions, fund transfers, and allowance without using the conditions mentioned in the criteria.
        - function BrokerV2.bid(uint256,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the structures specified in the criteria.   1. There's no `require(xxx == True);` followed by `xxx = False;` (plus an
          optional `xxx = True;` afterwards) or vice versa.  2. There's no `if(!xxx) throw;` followed by `xxx = true;` (plus an optional `xxx = False;` afterwards).  3.
          There's no `require(!xxx);` followed by `xxx = True;` (plus an optional `xxx = False;` afterwards).  Thus, none of the specified structures are present in the
          function.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['Token.safeTransferFrom(Token.ownerOf(tokenID),address(this),tokenID)', '_auction.highestBidder.transfer(_auction.currentBid)',
    'erc20Token.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),amount)', 'erc20Token.transfer(_auction.highestBidder,_auction.currentBid)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - _auction.highestBidder.transfer(_auction.currentBid) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external
        call '_auction.highestBidder.transfer(_auction.currentBid)' contains the keyword '.transfer('. Therefore, it satisfies the first characteristic.. Parameter in
        'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - erc20Token.transfer(_auction.highestBidder,_auction.currentBid) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - Token.safeTransferFrom(Token.ownerOf(tokenID),address(this),tokenID) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - erc20Token.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - erc20Token.transfer(_auction.highestBidder,_auction.currentBid) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['Token.safeTransferFrom(Token.ownerOf(tokenID),address(this),tokenID)', 'erc20Token.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),amount)',
    'erc20Token.transfer(_auction.highestBidder,_auction.currentBid)']
    Analyze External Address
        The variable 'Token' in external call 'Token.safeTransferFrom(Token.ownerOf(tokenID),address(this),tokenID)' has no state variable assigned in
        BrokerV2.bid(uint256,address,uint256). Therefore we check whether it has been hardcoded in the function.
            No The variable 'Token' is dynamically assigned from the parameter '_mintableToken', which is passed into the function when it is called. There is no
            hardcoded value for this variable within the function itself; instead, its value comes from an external source provided by the function's caller at runtime.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
