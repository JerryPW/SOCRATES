Function Security Analysis for EthTokenToSmthSwaps.refund(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function refund.
    Check direct function security
        - function EthTokenToSmthSwaps.refund(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain conditions or checks directly involving msg.sender against an Owner/Address/Leader/CEO related variable or entity as
          specified in the characteristics.
        - function EthTokenToSmthSwaps.refund(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code checks `require(swap.balance > uint256(0));` which does not match any of the required structures mentioned.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['ERC20(swap.token).transfer(msg.sender,swap.balance)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - ERC20(swap.token).transfer(msg.sender,swap.balance) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - ERC20(swap.token).transfer(msg.sender,swap.balance) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['ERC20(swap.token).transfer(msg.sender,swap.balance)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['swaps'] should be checked in variable swap
        Checked variables: swaps
            No None of the functions provided are constructors as their names do not match the contract name 'EthTokenToSmthSwaps' and none are explicitly named
            'constructor'. Additionally, none of the functions hardcode the state variable 'swaps' directly as they manipulate or modify its data using variables from
            function arguments, but do not hardcode values into it.
            Function Security Analysis for EthTokenToSmthSwaps.createSwap(bytes20,address,uint256,address)
                There are no modifiers should be examined in function createSwap.
                Check direct function security
                    - function EthTokenToSmthSwaps.createSwap(bytes20,address,uint256,address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                      Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures involving checks or conditions with `msg.sender`. It uses `require` statements to
                      perform conditions on `_value` and `ERC20(_token).transferFrom`, but none check `msg.sender` against specific owners or administrative roles.
                    - function EthTokenToSmthSwaps.createSwap(bytes20,address,uint256,address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                      Reason: The code above does not contain any of the specified structures. It has multiple 'require' statements, but they do not match the required
                      structures involving state changes between true and false of the same variable.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
