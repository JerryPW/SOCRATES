    Check direct function security
        - function TreasureHunt.unlockTreasure(bytes32) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function checks for certain conditions related to the treasure hunt, such as its active status and secret matching, but it does not involve
          ownership or specific address controls over the caller using conditions like 'msg.sender == xxxOwner'.
        - function TreasureHunt.unlockTreasure(bytes32) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: In the code, the negation of the 'isActive' state (i.e., setting it to false) is done after the main logic of the function which involves checking the
          secret, transferring DGX tokens, etc. Thus, it does not immediately perform a state negation operation on 'isActive' after checking its state using 'require'.
