        There are ['eternal'] should be checked in variable eternal
        Checked variables: eternal
            Yes The given piece of code contains a constructor, which is indicated by the function named 'constructor'. In Solidity, this indicates a special function
            that gets executed only once when the contract is initially deployed. This constructor function initializes the "eternal" state variable using the passed
            address parameter "_s". Therefore, the code satisfies the first characteristic, as it contains a constructor function.
        There are ['base'] should be checked in variable base
        Checked variables: base
            Yes The function in the provided code is named 'constructor', which indicates it is indeed a constructor, satisfying the first characteristic for outputting
            'Yes'. Since constructors are by definition functions that match the contract name or are explicitly named 'constructor', this code meets the criteria.
        There are ['base'] should be checked in variable base
        Checked variables: base
            Yes The code contains a constructor function, identified explicitly by the keyword 'constructor'. This indicates that the function is a constructor, which
            satisfies the first characteristic stated in the instructions. Furthermore, the constructor function directly interacts with the state variable 'base', but it
            is not hardcoded as it is assigned a value using the input parameter '_base'.
        There are ['base'] should be checked in variable base
        Checked variables: base
            Yes The function in the provided code is named 'constructor', which matches the criteria for being a constructor function. In Solidity, a constructor is run
            only once when a contract is created and is not callable afterwards. Constructors often initialize state variables or perform important initialization tasks.
            As it is explicitly named 'constructor', it satisfies the first characteristic provided: checking if the function is a constructor.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: Escrow.recovery(address)
Function Security Analysis for Escrow.recovery(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function recovery.
    Check direct function security
        - function Escrow.recovery(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not perform any checks on msg.sender as per the required structures.
        - function Escrow.recovery(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures. It calls two functions, r1 and r2, with the address _tag parameter. None of the
          require statements with specific conditions or assignments to 'True' or 'False' are present.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['userRecover', 'releaseFunds', 'release']

            There are no modifiers should be examined in function userRecover.
            Check direct function security
                - function Escrow.userRecover(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: None of the specified structures such as require, if, or assert involving msg.sender and xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO are present in the code.
                - function Escrow.userRecover(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures or characteristics: it does not have a conditional or require statement that checks a
                  boolean variable and then sets it to the opposite value. Instead, it performs a series of operations related to transferring amounts and handling a
                  transaction.

Start analyze function: Escrow.r2(address)
Function Security Analysis for Escrow.r2(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function r2.
    Check direct function security
        - function Escrow.r2(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any checks involving msg.sender comparing it to xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
        - function Escrow.r2(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon re-evaluation, the code only contains a require statement checking if transaction.status equals transactionStatus.PendingR2, but it does not match
          the pattern completely. The second statement in the pattern, 'xxx = False' or 'xxx = True', does not correspond to setting a boolean opposite in the code
          provided (PendingR2 to Completed is not a straightforward boolean transition from True to False or vice versa). Therefore, it does not fully satisfy any of the
          structures outlined.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

                - function Escrow.recovery(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function 'recovery' does not contain any of the specified structures related to 'msg.sender' to check for specific roles or addresses, such
                  as 'Owner', 'Leader', or 'CEO'.
                - function Escrow.recovery(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code does not satisfy any of the given structures as there are no 'require', 'if', or assignment statements involving a Boolean

Start analyze function: Escrow.r1(address)
Function Security Analysis for Escrow.r1(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function r1.
    Check direct function security
        - function Escrow.r1(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any condition that checks if msg.sender is equal to or not equal to xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO using require, if, or
          assert statements.
        - function Escrow.r1(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code has the statement 'require(transaction.status == transactionStatus.PendingR1);', but the next line sets 'transaction.status' to
          'transactionStatus.PendingR2', not 'False'. The required corresponding update to 'transaction.status = False;' is not present, nor does it match the conditions
          outlined for structures 1, 2, 3, or 4. None of the structures are fully satisfied.

                - function Escrow.recovery(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The provided code does not contain any checks or assertions involving msg.sender. It simply calls two functions, r1 and r2, passing _tag as an

                - function Escrow.recovery(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code does not include any 'require' or 'if' statements that check the condition of a boolean variable, followed by assignments to
                  this boolean variable. It simply defines a private function calling two other functions, r1 and r2.
