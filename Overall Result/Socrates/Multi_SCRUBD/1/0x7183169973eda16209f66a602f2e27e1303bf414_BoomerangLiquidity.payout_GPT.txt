Function Security Analysis for BoomerangLiquidity.payout()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function payout.
    Check direct function security
        - function BoomerangLiquidity.payout() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not involve any checks or assertions related to msg.sender being equal to or not equal to xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
        - function BoomerangLiquidity.payout() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function contains 'require(balance > 1);', which does not match any of the specified patterns involving 'require' with 'true' or 'false', or 'if'
          with 'throw'.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['weak_hands.buy.value(investment)(msg.sender)', 'participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.send(payoutToSend)',
    'participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.call.value(payoutToSend).gas(1000000)()']
    Analyze Transfer
        - participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.send(payoutToSend) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The
        external call contains the '.send(' keyword. Thus, it satisfies one of the specified characteristics.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - weak_hands.buy.value(investment)(msg.sender) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - The gas limit in participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.call.value(payoutToSend).gas(1000000)() is 1000000, which is too high. Therefore, it will not prevent
        REE problem.
    Remaining external call: ['weak_hands.buy.value(investment)(msg.sender)', 'participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.call.value(payoutToSend).gas(1000000)()']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['weak_hands'] should be checked in variable weak_hands
        Checked variables: weak_hands
            Yes The function name 'BoomerangLiquidity' matches the contract name 'BoomerangLiquidity', indicating that it is a constructor. Constructors are special
            functions used for contract initialization and are run only once when the contract is deployed.
        There are ['participants'] should be checked in variable participants
        Checked variables: participants
            No The functions in the provided code snippet do not match the characteristics stated.  1. The function names 'deposit' and 'payout' do not match the contract
            name 'BoomerangLiquidity', nor are they explicitly named 'constructor'. So they cannot be constructors.  2. The functions do not contain any hardcoded values
            of the state variable 'participants'. The 'participants' array is being manipulated (pushed and modified), but the entire array or specific indices are not
            hardcoded.  Therefore, neither of the functions satisfy either characteristic 1 or 2.
            Function Security Analysis for BoomerangLiquidity.deposit()
                There are no modifiers should be examined in function deposit.
                Check direct function security
                    - function BoomerangLiquidity.deposit() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                      Reason: The function 'deposit' does not contain any of the specified conditions that involve checking the msg.sender against an
                      xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
                    - function BoomerangLiquidity.deposit() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                      Reason: The given function does not contain any of the specified structures involving 'require' or 'if' statements with the logical operations
                      described (e.g., setting a variable to true or false after a condition). It deals with depositing and processing in a list but lacks the conditional
                      structures mentioned.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
