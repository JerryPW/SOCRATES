Function Security Analysis for TydoIco.refund()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function refund.
    Check direct function security
        - function TydoIco.refund() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not have any condition using msg.sender with the specified structures.
        - function TydoIco.refund() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code checks if 'state' is equal to 2 using 'require(state == 2);', but it doesn't set 'state' to False, True, or anything else within this function.
          Therefore, it does not match any of the specified patterns.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['token.transfer(owner,balances[msg.sender])', 'msg.sender.transfer(weiAmount)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - token.transfer(owner,balances[msg.sender]) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - msg.sender.transfer(weiAmount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains
        '.transfer(', satisfying characteristic 1.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - token.transfer(owner,balances[msg.sender]) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['token.transfer(owner,balances[msg.sender])']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            Yes The provided code is a constructor because it is defined with the keyword 'constructor' in the function signature. In Solidity, constructors are special
            functions that are executed only once when the contract is deployed, and they are typically used to initialize contract state variables. No hardcoded state
            variables are detected in the provided code.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
