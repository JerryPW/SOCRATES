Function Security Analysis for EscrowGoods.safeSend(address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function safeSend.
    Check direct function security
        - function EscrowGoods.safeSend(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function lacks any checks involving msg.sender against an xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO in the forms listed in the criteria.
        - function EscrowGoods.safeSend(address,uint256) has security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The code matches the fourth structure: 'if(!xxx) throw;' corresponds to 'if(atomicLock) throw;', and 'xxx = true;' corresponds to 'atomicLock = true;'.
          The structure is satisfied because the operation 'atomicLock = true;' immediately follows the check 'if(atomicLock) throw;' before the main logic of the
          function executes. Thus, it meets the structural requirement.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
