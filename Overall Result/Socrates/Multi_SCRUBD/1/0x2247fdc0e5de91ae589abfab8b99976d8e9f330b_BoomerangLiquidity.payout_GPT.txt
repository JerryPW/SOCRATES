Function Security Analysis for BoomerangLiquidity.payout()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function payout.
    Check direct function security
        - function BoomerangLiquidity.payout() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not satisfy any of the characteristics. There is no check or condition involving msg.sender in a way that matches the given criteria.
        - function BoomerangLiquidity.payout() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code uses 'require(balance > 1);' and does not have any relevant statement that matches the required patterns. Hence, none of the specified
          structures from the prompt are met in the provided function.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.call.value(payoutToSend).gas(1000000)()', 'flmContract.buy.value(investment)(msg.sender)']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - The gas limit in participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.call.value(payoutToSend).gas(1000000)() is 1000000, which is too high. Therefore, it will not prevent
        REE problem.
        - flmContract.buy.value(investment)(msg.sender) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.call.value(payoutToSend).gas(1000000)()', 'flmContract.buy.value(investment)(msg.sender)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['participants'] should be checked in variable participants
        Checked variables: participants
            No The provided code contains two functions: 'deposit' and 'payout'. Neither of these functions are constructors because their names do not match the contract
            name 'BoomerangLiquidity', nor are they explicitly named 'constructor'. Additionally, the state variable 'participants' is dynamically updated in the
            'deposit' function when a participant is added, and there's no hardcoding of the 'participants' variable observed in the code. The value pushed to
            'participants' is calculated based on runtime variables, specifically 'msg.sender' and 'msg.value'.
            Function Security Analysis for BoomerangLiquidity.deposit()
                There are no modifiers should be examined in function deposit.
                Check direct function security
                    - function BoomerangLiquidity.deposit() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                      Reason: The code does not include any checks involving msg.sender being compared to xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO or similar identifiers.
                    - function BoomerangLiquidity.deposit() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                      Reason: The code does not contain any require or if statement checking a variable condition, followed by changing that variable's value, matching
                      the specified patterns.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
