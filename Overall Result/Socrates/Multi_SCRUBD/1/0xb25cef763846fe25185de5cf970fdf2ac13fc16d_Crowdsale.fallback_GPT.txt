Function Security Analysis for Crowdsale.fallback()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
    Check direct function security
        - function Crowdsale.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any conditional check or assert statements confirming the sender's identity using msg.sender compared to an owner,
          address, or titled position like Leader or CEO.
        - function Crowdsale.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon reevaluation, the code contains the statement `require(!crowdsaleClosed);` but lacks a subsequent change of the `crowdsaleClosed` variable to
          `True`. Therefore, it does not fully satisfy any of the required structures because both elements of a structure are not present. Hence, my previous judgment
          was incorrect.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['beneficiary.send(amount)', 'tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,sendTokens)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - beneficiary.send(amount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        'beneficiary.send(amount)' contains the keyword '.send('. This satisfies the second characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,sendTokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,sendTokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,sendTokens)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['tokenReward'] should be checked in variable tokenReward
        Checked variables: tokenReward
            Yes 1. The function provided is named 'Crowdsale', which matches the contract name 'Crowdsale'. This implies the function is a constructor. 2. In the function
            'Crowdsale', the state variable 'tokenReward' is hardcoded with the address '0x745Fa4002332C020f6a05B3FE04BCCf060e36dD3'.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
