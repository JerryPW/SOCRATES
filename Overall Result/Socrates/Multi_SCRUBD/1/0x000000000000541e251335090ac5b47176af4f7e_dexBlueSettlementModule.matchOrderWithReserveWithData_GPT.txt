    There are no modifiers should be examined in function matchOrderWithReserveWithData.
    Check direct function security
        - function dexBlueSettlementModule.matchOrderWithReserveWithData(dexBlueStructs.Order,address,dexBlueStructs.ReserveTrade,bytes32[]) has no security assurance
        protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The solidity function does not contain any statements or conditions that involve "msg.sender" with a specific role like Owner/Address/Leader/CEO in a
          way stated in the criteria.
        - function dexBlueSettlementModule.matchOrderWithReserveWithData(dexBlueStructs.Order,address,dexBlueStructs.ReserveTrade,bytes32[]) has no apparent security
        assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures: require statements based on boolean conditions or the described if-throw structure.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['settleReserveTradeWithData']
        Function Security Analysis for dexBlueSettlementModule.settleReserveTradeWithData(dexBlueStructs.OrderInputPacked,dexBlueStructs.TradeInputPacked,bytes32[])
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function settleReserveTradeWithData.
            Check direct function security
                - function dexBlueSettlementModule.settleReserveTradeWithData(dexBlueStructs.OrderInputPacked,dexBlueStructs.TradeInputPacked,bytes32[]) has no security
                assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structural characteristics that involve explicit checks about 'msg.sender' against an owner,
                  address, leader or CEO.
                - function dexBlueSettlementModule.settleReserveTradeWithData(dexBlueStructs.OrderInputPacked,dexBlueStructs.TradeInputPacked,bytes32[]) has no apparent
                security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code does not have any 'require' or 'if(!xxx) throw' statement that sets a boolean variable and then assigns it to the opposite
                  boolean value.
External Call Analysis

        - address(this).call.gas(trade.gasLimit)(abi.encodePacked(dexBlue(address(0)).executeReserveTradeWithData.selector,abi.encode(order.sellToken,trade.orderAmount-
        trade.reserveFee,order.buyToken,trade.reserveAmount-trade.reserveRebate,reserve,data))) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Here is the reason: The variable
        'trade.gasLimit' is assigned an empty list. In Python, lists do not have a numerical limit like integers or floats. Therefore, comparing a list with an integer
        value like 3000 is not possible in a straightforward manner. Since 'trade.gasLimit' is not assigned any number at any point, and strictly speaking, an empty list
        cannot be directly compared to the integer 3000, it does not make meaningful sense to determine whether it is less than or equal to 3000. However, in terms of
        values within a list, if introduced, one would have to check the specific value(s) each element holds to determine if they meet the criteria. Given no specific
        values are provided, or the list remains empty, no number assigned means it can't exceed or be less than 3000, rendering this inquiry effectively non-applicable
        without further context.
    Remaining external call:
    ['address(this).call.gas(trade.gasLimit)(abi.encodePacked(dexBlue(address(0)).executeReserveTradeWithData.selector,abi.encode(order.sellToken,trade.orderAmount-
    trade.reserveFee,order.buyToken,trade.reserveAmount-trade.reserveRebate,reserve,data)))']
    Analyze External Address
        External call
        address(this).call.gas(trade.gasLimit)(abi.encodePacked(dexBlue(address(0)).executeReserveTradeWithData.selector,abi.encode(order.sellToken,trade.orderAmount-
        trade.reserveFee,order.buyToken,trade.reserveAmount-trade.reserveRebate,reserve,data))) calls contract address, which consider no REE problem.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
