    Analyze External Address
        There are ['swaps'] should be checked in variable swap
        Checked variables: swaps
            No 1. None of the functions are named 'EthTokenToSmthSwaps', which is the contract name, and none are explicitly named 'constructor'. So, they are not
            constructors.  2. From the provided code snippets, there isn't any hardcoded state variable named 'swaps'. All manipulations involving 'swaps' are done using
            dynamic inputs and not hardcoded values.  Therefore, none of the characteristics required are satisfied.

                There are no modifiers should be examined in function createSwap.
                Check direct function security
                    - function EthTokenToSmthSwaps.createSwap(bytes20,address,uint256,address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                      Reason: The code does not contain any structure that checks if msg.sender is related to any owner or address variables such as
                      xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
                    - function EthTokenToSmthSwaps.createSwap(bytes20,address,uint256,address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                      Reason: The code does not include any of the specified structures from the provided characteristics.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
