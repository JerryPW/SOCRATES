External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['tokenContract.balanceOf(this)', 'tokenContract.transfer(msg.sender,_numberOfTokens)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - tokenContract.transfer(msg.sender,_numberOfTokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - tokenContract.balanceOf(this) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - tokenContract.transfer(msg.sender,_numberOfTokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['tokenContract.balanceOf(this)', 'tokenContract.transfer(msg.sender,_numberOfTokens)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['tokenContract'] should be checked in variable tokenContract
        Checked variables: tokenContract
            Yes The function name 'GOOGTokenSale' matches the contract name, indicating that it is a constructor.
        There are ['tokenContract'] should be checked in variable tokenContract
        Checked variables: tokenContract
            Yes The function is named 'GOOGTokenSale', which matches the name of the contract, indicating that this is a constructor function. Constructors in Solidity
            are special functions that have the same name as the contract (for versions below 0.4.22) or are explicitly stated with the 'constructor' keyword (for
            versions 0.4.22 and above). Therefore, it satisfies the first characteristic.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
