    There are no modifiers should be examined in function determinePID.
    Check direct function security
        - function MonkeyScam.determinePID(LDdatasets.EventReturns) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The given function does not include any checks on msg.sender against an owner, address, leader, or CEO using the specified patterns like require, if, or
          assert statements.
        - function MonkeyScam.determinePID(LDdatasets.EventReturns) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not contain any of the required structures. There is no 'require' or 'if (!xxx) throw' statement setting a variable and later
          changing its state.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['buyXname', 'fallback', 'buyXaddr', 'buyXid']
        Function Security Analysis for MonkeyScam.buyXname(bytes32)
            The modifier of function buyXname are ['isActivated', 'isHuman', 'isWithinLimits']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier isActivated has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier 'isActivated' checks whether a variable 'activated_' is true before allowing the function to proceed. This does not match any of
                  the characteristics specified for ownership enforcement or lock mechanism. It only checks the state of a variable without connecting it to access
                  control or reentrancy prevention patterns.
                - modifier isHuman has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier checks if msg.sender is a human by ensuring the address has no code associated with it, which means requiring that smart contracts
                  cannot call the function. However, it does not strictly enforce ownership or a lock mechanism, nor does it have an indicative name to imply such
                  protection.
                - modifier isWithinLimits has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier isWithinLimits does not enforce any access control based on the sender address (Rule 1) or use a locking mechanism (Rule 2). It
                  only checks if a given amount is within specified limits. There is no indication from the function name that it enforces access control, such as
                  OnlyOwner, or a lock mechanism, such as nonReentrant (Rule 3).
            Check direct function security
                - function MonkeyScam.buyXname(bytes32) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The provided function code does not contain any statement that checks for specific msg.sender roles such as xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO
                  as described in the given characteristics.
                - function MonkeyScam.buyXname(bytes32) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The function does not follow any of the given structures. It uses if-else blocks for affiliate code validation but doesn't have 'require'
                  statements or throw errors with variable manipulations indicated in the characteristics.
