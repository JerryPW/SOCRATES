Function Security Analysis for Crowdsale.fallback()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
    Check direct function security
        - function Crowdsale.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures where msg.sender is compared to a particular owner or leader address for permissions or
          validations.
        - function Crowdsale.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code contains the statement 'require(!crowdsaleClosed);' followed by other operations, but it does not include changing 'crowdsaleClosed' to true or
          false anywhere in the function. It partially matches pattern 3 because it uses `require(!xxx);` with `xxx` being `crowdsaleClosed`, but it doesn't modify
          `crowdsaleClosed` after that point.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,amount/price)', 'beneficiary.send(amountRaised)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,amount/price) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - beneficiary.send(amountRaised) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains '.send('
        keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,amount/price) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,amount/price)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['tokenReward'] should be checked in variable tokenReward
        Checked variables: tokenReward
            Yes The function name 'Crowdsale' matches the contract name 'Crowdsale', which indicates that the function is a constructor. Constructors are initialization
            routines that set up contract state when the contract is deployed, hence satisfying the first characteristic. Additionally, the state variable 'tokenReward'
            has not been hardcoded but is rather set using a parameter 'addressOfTokenUsedAsReward', which does not satisfy the second characteristic.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
