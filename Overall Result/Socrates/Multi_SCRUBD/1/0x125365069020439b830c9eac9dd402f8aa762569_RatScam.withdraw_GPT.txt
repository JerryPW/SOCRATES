Function Security Analysis for RatScam.withdraw()
    The modifier of function withdraw are ['isActivated', 'isHuman']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier isActivated has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier does not enforce ownership or specific address execution, nor does it implement a locking mechanism. It solely checks the state of the
          variable 'activated_' to ensure the function can proceed. This does not satisfy any of the specified rules for outputting 'Yes'.
        - modifier isHuman has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier enforces that only human users (not contracts) can execute the function by checking if msg.sender is equal to tx.origin. While it does
          restrict access, it doesn't specifically restrict it to an owner or a specific address, nor does it perform a lock operation. The term 'isHuman' does not imply
          restricted access as defined in rules one or two.
    Check direct function security
        - function RatScam.withdraw() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not include any checks or statements that match the provided structures, which check whether the transaction sender (msg.sender) is a
          specific owner or address such as xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
        - function RatScam.withdraw() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures. It checks conditions and sets variables, but none match the required pattern
          involving mutual requirement/assertion and variable reassignment as described.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['plyr_[_pID].addr.transfer(_eth)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - plyr_[_pID].addr.transfer(_eth) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the
        keyword '.transfer(', which matches the first characteristic specified in the instructions.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: RatScam.endRound(RSdatasets.EventReturns)
Function Security Analysis for RatScam.endRound(RSdatasets.EventReturns)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function endRound.
    Check direct function security
        - function RatScam.endRound(RSdatasets.EventReturns) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the required structures: There are no 'require', 'if', or 'assert' statements with 'msg.sender' checking for owner or
          leader type variables.
        - function RatScam.endRound(RSdatasets.EventReturns) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not match any of the specified structures. It does not contain a 'require' statement checking a boolean, followed by a
          reassignment of that boolean, nor an 'if' statement matching the described format involving a boolean variable being set to true and then potentially false
          later.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['reLoadXid', 'buyXid', 'reLoadCore', 'reLoadXname', 'buyXname', 'fallback', 'buyCore', 'reLoadXaddr', 'buyXaddr', 'withdraw']
        Function Security Analysis for RatScam.reLoadXid(uint256,uint256)
            The modifier of function reLoadXid are ['isActivated', 'isHuman', 'isWithinLimits']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier isActivated has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: This modifier does not enforce that only the owner or specific addresses can execute the function, and it does not involve a lock operation. It
                  simply checks if a flag called 'activated_' is true. The modifier name 'isActivated' implies a state check, rather than an access control or reentrancy
                  pattern.
                - modifier isHuman has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier checks whether the sender is a human (not a contract) by comparing msg.sender to tx.origin, but it doesn't enforce only owner or
                  specific addresses, nor does it use a lock mechanism. It also does not provide contextual function naming like Onlyxxx or nonReentrant.
                - modifier isWithinLimits has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier does not specify any condition related to ownership checks or specific address checks (rule 1), nor does it implement any locking
                  mechanism to prevent reentrancy (rule 2). Additionally, the modifier name 'isWithinLimits' does not suggest owner restrictions or a non-reentrancy
                  pattern (rule 3).
            Check direct function security
                - function RatScam.reLoadXid(uint256,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The given code does not contain any of the patterns mentioned: 'require' or 'assert' conditions that involve checking the identity of
                  'msg.sender' against a specific owner or leader address, nor does it have 'if' conditions that directly throw exceptions based on 'msg.sender'.
                - function RatScam.reLoadXid(uint256,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain 'require' statements or a 'throw' statement. It uses a conditional 'if' statement, but it doesn't match the structures
                  specified for evaluation. The if condition checks and executes logic but doesn't result in 'throw' or require statements being satisfied with variable
                  reassignment as described by the rules.
External Call Analysis

    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - address(RatKingCorp).call.value(_com)(bytes4(keccak256()(deposit()))) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['address(RatKingCorp).call.value(_com)(bytes4(keccak256()(deposit())))']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['RatKingCorp'] should be checked in variable RatKingCorp
        Checked variables: RatKingCorp
            State variable RatKingCorp has initialized in public area after declaration.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
