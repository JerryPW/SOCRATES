Function Security Analysis for SynthetixEscrow.vest()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function vest.
    Check direct function security
        - function SynthetixEscrow.vest() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code provided does not contain any of the specific structures mentioned, like checking if msg.sender equals a certain owner, address, or leader
          before executing certain logic.
        - function SynthetixEscrow.vest() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not have a require statement or an if statement followed by a throw that checks a boolean variable and then switches its value from
          true to false or from false to true. The listed patterns do not match any structures provided in the problem.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['synthetix.transfer(msg.sender,total)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - synthetix.transfer(msg.sender,total) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - synthetix.transfer(msg.sender,total) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['synthetix.transfer(msg.sender,total)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['synthetix'] should be checked in variable synthetix
        Checked variables: synthetix
            Yes There is a constructor in the provided code which is explicitly named as 'constructor', and within this constructor, the provided state variable
            'synthetix' is hardcoded with the parameter '_synthetix'. Therefore, the external call satisfies both characteristics: it is a constructor and the state
            variable 'synthetix' is hardcoded within it.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
