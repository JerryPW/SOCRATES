    Check direct function security
        - function ERC721._safeMint(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The given function does not check 'msg.sender' against any of the specified roles or addresses as outlined in the conditions.
        - function ERC721._safeMint(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code provided does not contain any of the specified structures. There are no require statements or throw statements with condition checking a
          variable, nor are there assignments to True or False for a variable within these conditional structures.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

            Check direct function security
                - function DogeviathanBasic.createCollectible() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not have any of the specified authorization checks related to msg.sender against an owner or specific address. It does not check
                  if msg.sender is an owner or related entity.
                - function DogeviathanBasic.createCollectible() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The function does not include any structure that matches the required patterns. It uses require statements with conditions not related to a
                  boolean variable flipping between true/false.

                - function ERC721.safeTransferFrom(address,address,uint256,bytes) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function checks if the caller is approved or is the owner using _isApprovedOrOwner(_msgSender(), tokenId) but does not use direct checks on
                  msg.sender against a specific owner/leader/CEO address.
                - function ERC721.safeTransferFrom(address,address,uint256,bytes) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code contains a require statement, but the pattern - require(xxx == True/False) with a corresponding xxx assignment after - is not present.

    Analyze External Address
        The variable 'to' in external call 'to.functionCall(abi.encodeWithSelector(IERC721Receiver(to).onERC721Received.selector,_msgSender(),from,tokenId,_data),ERC721:t
        ransfertononERC721Receiverimplementer)' has no state variable assigned in ERC721._checkOnERC721Received(address,address,uint256,bytes). Considering that it is an
        internal/private function, we analyze the function inputs.
        Analyze External Address
            The variable 'to' in external call 'to' has no state variable assigned in ERC721._safeTransfer(address,address,uint256,bytes). Considering that it is an
            internal/private function, we analyze the function inputs.
            Analyze External Address
                The variable 'to' in external call 'to' has no state variable assigned in ERC721.safeTransferFrom(address,address,uint256,bytes). Therefore we check
                whether it has been hardcoded in the function.
                    No The code defines a function called 'safeTransferFrom' which takes several parameters including 'to'. This parameter 'to' represents the address to
                    which an ERC721 token is to be transferred. However, the value of 'to' is not hardcoded anywhere within this function. Instead, it is passed as an
                    argument when the function is called and is thus determined by the caller. Since 'to' is not fixed or pre-determined within this code snippet, it is
                    not hardcoded.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
