Function Security Analysis for RatScam.endRound(RSdatasets.EventReturns)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function endRound.
    Check direct function security
        - function RatScam.endRound(RSdatasets.EventReturns) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function `endRound` does not contain any control structure related to msg.sender checks, like restricting access based on msg.sender or asserting
          msg.sender roles. Therefore, it does not match any of the given structures.
        - function RatScam.endRound(RSdatasets.EventReturns) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures requiring or checking a condition on a boolean variable and then modifying it
          accordingly.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['reLoadXid', 'buyCore', 'reLoadXname', 'buyXname', 'reLoadCore', 'buyXaddr', 'fallback', 'buyXid', 'reLoadXaddr', 'withdraw']
        Function Security Analysis for RatScam.reLoadXid(uint256,uint256)
            The modifier of function reLoadXid are ['isActivated', 'isHuman', 'isWithinLimits']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier isActivated has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier 'isActivated' does not explicitly indicate owner or specific address checks, nor does it involve a lock operation. It requires
                  'activated_' to be true, ensuring a certain condition is met, but it doesn't directly relate to ownership or function reentrancy protection inferred
                  from its name.
                - modifier isHuman has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier checks if the sender of the transaction is the same as the original initiator of the transaction. This does not restrict execution
                  to specific addresses or owners, nor does it use locking mechanisms.
                - modifier isWithinLimits has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The code in the modifier does not check for ownership or specific addresses (rule 1), does not involve a lock operation (rule 2), and the name
                  isWithinLimits does not imply such checks (rule 3).
            Check direct function security
                - function RatScam.reLoadXid(uint256,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function doesn't contain any of the specified patterns which involve checking msg.sender against an owner, address, Leader or CEO.
                - function RatScam.reLoadXid(uint256,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The function does not contain any of the defined structures. It involves checking conditions, assigning values, and calling functions, but none
                  of those match the template provided of using 'require(xxx == True)' followed by 'xxx = False' or its variants.
