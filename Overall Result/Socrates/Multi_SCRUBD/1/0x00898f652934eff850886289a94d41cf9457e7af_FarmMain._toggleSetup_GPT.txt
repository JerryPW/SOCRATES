Function Security Analysis for FarmMain._toggleSetup(uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _toggleSetup.
    Check direct function security
        - function FarmMain._toggleSetup(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not have any condition that directly checks or asserts the identity of msg.sender against xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO. It
          primarily focuses on manipulating setup states based on block number conditions without any sender-authority checks.
        - function FarmMain._toggleSetup(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not have a require statement checking the value of a boolean variable and subsequently changing that variable, nor does it throw an error
          if a boolean variable is false, while later setting it to true. Instead, it manages the activation status of a setup based on block number conditions, but only
          dynamically setting the state based on other operations.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['_removeLiquidity', 'unlock', '_setOrAddFarmingSetupInfo', 'withdrawReward', 'activateSetup', 'withdrawLiquidity', 'setFarmingSetups',

            There are no modifiers should be examined in function _removeLiquidity.
            Check direct function security
                - function FarmMain._removeLiquidity(uint256,uint256,bool,uint256,bool) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The provided code does not contain any conditional check on msg.sender to compare it against a specific address like xxxOwner, xxxAddress,
                  Leader, or CEO. Thus it does not satisfy any of the specified structures.
                - function FarmMain._removeLiquidity(uint256,uint256,bool,uint256,bool) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code does not satisfy any of the given structures. There are no `require` statements or exception throw statements that meet the
                  conditions necessary for a 'Yes' output.
            Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
            The reachable functions are ['withdrawLiquidity', 'unlock']
                Function Security Analysis for FarmMain.withdrawLiquidity(uint256,uint256,bool,uint256)
                    There are no modifiers should be examined in function withdrawLiquidity.
                    Check direct function security
                        - function FarmMain.withdrawLiquidity(uint256,uint256,bool,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                          Reason: The code has a condition where msg.sender is checked for equality to farmingPosition.uniqueOwner, which may imply ownership validation.
                        - function FarmMain.withdrawLiquidity(uint256,uint256,bool,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                          Reason: The code does not explicitly contain any require statements that lead directly to setting the checked condition variable thereafter. It
                          utilizes require statements for parameters validation, but none follow the specific structures outlined in the provided criteria.

Start analyze function: FarmMain._giveBack(uint256)
Function Security Analysis for FarmMain._giveBack(uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _giveBack.
    Check direct function security
        - function FarmMain._giveBack(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not include any checks or assertions that involve the msg.sender matching a specific owner, address, or role keyword as described in the
          listed structures.
        - function FarmMain._giveBack(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures. It does not utilize require statements to check a condition on a boolean variable and
          then alter its value, nor does it use an if statement to throw based on a boolean condition.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

            There are no modifiers should be examined in function _removeLiquidity.
            Check direct function security
                - function FarmMain._removeLiquidity(uint256,uint256,bool,uint256,bool) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not include any of the specified structures related to checking 'msg.sender'. There are no require/assert statements involving
                  msg.sender being equal to or not equal to a specific owner, leader, CEO, or address.
                - function FarmMain._removeLiquidity(uint256,uint256,bool,uint256,bool) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code does not contain any statements involving `require` or `if` with the specified patterns that involve setting a boolean
                  variable to true or false and also ensuring some condition to be true or false beforehand. Hence, it does not match any of the specified structures in
                  the rules.
            Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

                Function Security Analysis for FarmMain.withdrawLiquidity(uint256,uint256,bool,uint256)
                    There are no modifiers should be examined in function withdrawLiquidity.
                    Check direct function security
                        - function FarmMain.withdrawLiquidity(uint256,uint256,bool,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                          Reason: Upon re-evaluation, the occurrence of 'farmingPosition.uniqueOwner == msg.sender' refers to a local variable (farmingPosition) with a
                          property uniqueOwner. This does not match the specified structures as you have indicated that ownership checks related to local variables do not
                          count. None of the other structures explicitly check for msg.sender against contract-level ownership variables or constants like
                          Owner/Address/Leader/CEO in a manner specified by the four given patterns.
                        - function FarmMain.withdrawLiquidity(uint256,uint256,bool,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified patterns: 'require(xxx == True); xxx = False;', 'require(xxx == False); xxx = True;',
                          'require(!xxx); xxx = True;', or 'if(!xxx) throw; xxx = true;'.

        There are ['_extension'] should be checked in variable _extension
        Checked variables: _extension
            No 1. The function name 'init' does not match the contract name 'FarmMain', nor is it explicitly named 'constructor'. So, it is not a constructor. 2. The
            state variable _extension is assigned with the value of the function parameter 'extension'. This assignment involves a passed argument, not a hardcoded value.
            Therefore, the function does not satisfy any of the specified characteristics.
            Function Security Analysis for FarmMain.init(address,bytes,address,address,bytes)
                There are no modifiers should be examined in function init.
                Check direct function security
                    - function FarmMain.init(address,bytes,address,address,bytes) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                      Reason: The function `init` doesn't contain any access control mechanism using `msg.sender` as described in the listed structures.
                    - function FarmMain.init(address,bytes,address,address,bytes) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                      Reason: The code does not have any of the specified structural patterns involving require clauses or if statements with a variable assignment
                      sequence as outlined in the four structures. It uses require statements for initial condition checks, but these are not followed by variable
                      assignments as specified in the rules.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
