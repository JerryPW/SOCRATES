Start analyze function: Investment.processFee(address,uint256,uint24)
Function Security Analysis for Investment.processFee(address,uint256,uint24)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function processFee.
    Check direct function security
        - function Investment.processFee(address,uint256,uint24) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code provided does not contain any checks involving the structure related to comparing msg.sender with xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO through
          require, if, or assert statements as specified.
        - function Investment.processFee(address,uint256,uint24) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code provided does not have any of the specified structures involving require statements or variable reassignment as described in the prompt.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['swapTokens', 'removeFromPool', 'addToPool']
        Function Security Analysis for Investment.swapTokens(address[],bytes,uint256,uint256,address)
            The modifier of function swapTokens are ['onlyOwner']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The modifier's name 'onlyOwner' implies restriction to the owner, in line with rule 3. There are no structural omissions as the modifier clearly
                  specifies a method '_checkOwner()' which likely enforces ownership checks.
        Function Security Analysis for Investment.removeFromPool(uint256,InvestmentLibrary.exitSwapParams[])
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function removeFromPool.
            Check direct function security
                - function Investment.removeFromPool(uint256,InvestmentLibrary.exitSwapParams[]) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of
                msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any explicit checks related to the caller being required to be a specific address like an owner or leader. The
                  'require' conditions mainly check for token balances and parameter correctness.
                - function Investment.removeFromPool(uint256,InvestmentLibrary.exitSwapParams[]) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The given code does not contain any of the specified structures. The function uses several require statements but none of them fit the described
                  pattern where a variable is checked then altered. Additionally, there are no if statements that throw based on the boolean value of a variable that is
                  subsequently altered.

    Analyze External Address
        There are ['_factoryAddress'] should be checked in variable feeHandlerAddress
        Checked variables: _factoryAddress
            Yes The code provided contains a constructor for the contract, as indicated by the keyword 'constructor'. Therefore, it satisfies the first characteristic.
            The function inside the code is a constructor, but there is no hardcoded value for the '_factoryAddress' state variable; instead, it is assigned from the
            constructor arguments.
        There are ['_factoryAddress'] should be checked in variable _factoryAddress
        Checked variables: _factoryAddress
            Yes The provided code is a constructor for the contract since it is explicitly named 'constructor'. This satisfies the first characteristic for a 'Yes'
            response according to the given rules.
        There are ['WETHAddress'] should be checked in variable WETHAddress
        Checked variables: WETHAddress
            State variable WETHAddress has initialized in public area after declaration.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: Investment._swapTokens(address[],bytes,uint256,uint256,address)
Function Security Analysis for Investment._swapTokens(address[],bytes,uint256,uint256,address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _swapTokens.
    Check direct function security
        - function Investment._swapTokens(address[],bytes,uint256,uint256,address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The given code does not include any of the specified structures related to checking msg.sender against an owner or similar address as described in the
          provided criteria.
        - function Investment._swapTokens(address[],bytes,uint256,uint256,address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any require or if statements to check boolean conditions while also modifying the evaluated variable, so it does not fit into
          any of the described structural patterns.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['crashProtect', 'addToPool', 'processFee', 'swapTokens', 'removeFromPool']
        Function Security Analysis for Investment.crashProtect(InvestmentLibrary.crashProtectParams[])
            The modifier of function crashProtect are ['onlyOwner']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The modifier name 'onlyOwner' indicates owner-specific enforcement. Although the implementation of '_checkOwner()' is not provided, the naming
                  complies with Rule 3, and there is no need to check for lock operation as it fits the criteria based on its name.
        Function Security Analysis for Investment.addToPool(uint256[])
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function addToPool.
            Check direct function security
                - function Investment.addToPool(uint256[]) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not have any line that checks if msg.sender is equal to (or not equal to) a specific owner/address/Leader/CEO using the
                  specified patterns.
                - function Investment.addToPool(uint256[]) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the required structures where a boolean condition is checked and modified as specified.

    Analyze External Address
        There are ['swapRouter'] should be checked in variable swapRouter
        Checked variables: swapRouter
            Yes The provided code snippet is a constructor as it is explicitly labeled as such with the keyword 'constructor'. The constructor function is used to
            initialize the contract, and it is named 'constructor'. Additionally, within this constructor, the state variable 'swapRouter' is being assigned the hardcoded
            address '0xE592427A0AEce92De3Edee1F18E0157C05861564'. Therefore, the function satisfies both criteria (1. constructor determination, 2. hardcoded state
            variable assignment).
        The variable 'decodedTokenIn_scope_0' in external call 'IERC20(decodedTokenIn_scope_0).approve(address(swapRouter),amountIn)' has no state variable assigned in
        Investment._swapTokens(address[],bytes,uint256,uint256,address). Therefore we check whether it has been hardcoded in the function.
            No The provided variable 'decodedTokenIn_scope_0' does not appear in the function code, nor is there any hardcoded variable that resembles
            'decodedTokenIn_scope_0'. All variables within the function are dynamically set based on inputs or calculations.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
