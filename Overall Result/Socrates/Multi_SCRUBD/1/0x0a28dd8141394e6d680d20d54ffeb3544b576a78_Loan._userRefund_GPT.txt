    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _userRefund.
    Check direct function security
        - function Loan._userRefund(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code contains a check for 'msg.sender == shareholder' but does not meet any of the outlined structures which focus on 'msg.sender ==
          xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO' in require, if, or assert statements, or 'msg.sender !=' structures followed by throw or within conditions.
        - function Loan._userRefund(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not conform to any of the defined structures as it lacks the pattern where a variable "xxx" is required to be true or false using
          'require', and then the value of "xxx" is explicitly changed to the opposite boolean value immediately after.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['userRefund']
        Function Security Analysis for Loan.userRefund()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function userRefund.
            Check direct function security
                - function Loan.userRefund() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code checks for msg.sender in the function `_userRefund`, but does not use msg.sender directly in any way related to the listed
                  characteristics.
                - function Loan.userRefund() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the required structures. It is a function named `userRefund` which calls another function
                  `_userRefund` with `msg.sender` as its argument, not involving conditions or variable assignments matching the specified patterns.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['_to.transfer(amount)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - _to.transfer(amount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the '.transfer('
        keyword, which matches the first characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Function Security Analysis for Loan.checkPayShareholder()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function checkPayShareholder.
    Check direct function security
        - function Loan.checkPayShareholder() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified msg.sender checks or assertions in the function.
        - function Loan.checkPayShareholder() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not have a `require` or `if` statement checking a boolean condition or variable nor does it follow the patterns mentioned in the
          structures (1-4).
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['autoCheckPayShareholder', '_userRefund', 'userRefund']
        Function Security Analysis for Loan.autoCheckPayShareholder()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function autoCheckPayShareholder.
            Check direct function security
                - function Loan.autoCheckPayShareholder() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code uses an if statement to conditionally check a balance, but it does not involve any checks on msg.sender for specific roles like owner,
                  address, leader, or CEO.
                - function Loan.autoCheckPayShareholder() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not follow any of the specified structures. It checks a condition using an 'if' statement and calls a function based on that
                  condition, but does not include 'require' or variable assignments as described in the specified structures.
            Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
            There are no reachable function for internal/private function, please manually check its successor contracts.
        Function Security Analysis for Loan._userRefund(address)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function _userRefund.
            Check direct function security
                - function Loan._userRefund(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: None of the specified conditions in the problem statement are met. The code does not contain restrictive conditions that specifically check
                  'msg.sender' against roles like xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO explicitly as required, using the exact patterns given (such as require, if, or assert
                  with 'msg.sender' related to such roles).
                - function Loan._userRefund(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The function involves checking for a condition (`_to != 0x0`) and assigns `_result` to both `false` and `true` under certain conditions.
                  However, none of the provided structures (1 to 4) exactly match with the ones described as the condition checked doesn't involve `require(xxx ==
                  True/False)` or `require(!xxx)`, nor does it throw on a false condition. Therefore, the code doesn't meet any specific structure to return 'Yes'.
            Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
            The reachable functions are ['userRefund']
                Function Security Analysis for Loan.userRefund()
                    There are no modifiers should be examined in function userRefund.
                    Check direct function security
                        - function Loan.userRefund() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                          Reason: The code provided does not contain any of the specified access control structures or permissions checks that involve comparing
                          msg.sender with an owner or authority-like address (xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO). Therefore, it fails to meet any of the given criteria.
                        - function Loan.userRefund() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures. It simply defines a function named `userRefund` that calls another
                          function `_userRefund` with the sender's address. There are no require statements or conditionals within this code, and no modifications to a
                          boolean variable are present.

    Direct external call: ['shareholder.transfer(toShareHolder)', 'token.profitOrgPay.value(toShareHolder)()']
    Analyze Transfer
        - shareholder.transfer(toShareHolder) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call contains the
        '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - token.profitOrgPay.value(toShareHolder)() ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['token.profitOrgPay.value(toShareHolder)()']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['shareholder'] should be checked in variable token

        There are no function that assign and initialize this variable. Please further manually check on successor contracts or modifiers.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
