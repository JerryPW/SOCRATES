Function Security Analysis for NamiExchange.buyNac(address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function buyNac.
    Check direct function security
        - function NamiExchange.buyNac(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain msg.sender checks against xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO.
        - function NamiExchange.buyNac(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided function does not contain any of the specified structures involving variable assignment and conditions. It only uses 'require' and 'assert'
          for input validation and verifying state consistency, not changing the state of a variable as per the required structures.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['namiToken.transfer(msg.sender,nac)', 'namiToken.balanceOf(msg.sender)', 'namiToken.transfer(msg.sender,ask[_seller].volume)',
    '_seller.send(maxEth)', '_seller.send(msg.value)', 'msg.sender.send(msg.value.sub(maxEth))']
    Analyze Transfer
        - namiToken.transfer(msg.sender,nac) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - namiToken.transfer(msg.sender,ask[_seller].volume) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - _seller.send(maxEth) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call '_seller.send(maxEth)' contains the
        '.send(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - _seller.send(msg.value) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call '_seller.send(msg.value)' contains
        the '.send(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - msg.sender.send(msg.value.sub(maxEth)) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call
        'msg.sender.send(msg.value.sub(maxEth))' contains the '.send(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - namiToken.transfer(msg.sender,nac) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - namiToken.balanceOf(msg.sender) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - namiToken.transfer(msg.sender,ask[_seller].volume) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['namiToken.transfer(msg.sender,nac)', 'namiToken.balanceOf(msg.sender)', 'namiToken.transfer(msg.sender,ask[_seller].volume)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['NamiAddr'] should be checked in variable namiToken
        Checked variables: NamiAddr
            Yes The function `NamiExchange` has the same name as the contract `NamiExchange`, which indicates it is a constructor. Constructors are special functions that
            are executed once when a contract is first deployed. They are typically used to initialize state variables and set up initial contract state. There is no
            hardcoding of state variables in this code snippet as the state variable `NamiAddr` is being set using the argument `_namiAddress`. Therefore, the function
            meets the first criterion of being a constructor.
        There are ['NamiAddr'] should be checked in variable namiToken
        Checked variables: NamiAddr
            Yes The function name "NamiExchange" matches the contract name "NamiExchange", indicating that this function is a constructor based on naming conventions
            before Solidity 0.4.22. Constructors typically initialize state variables using parameters, as seen with "NamiAddr = _namiAddress;" within this function.
            However, since it was specified to check if the state variable is hardcoded, and it is set by a parameter, it is not hardcoded. Therefore, the presence of a
            constructor satisfies the constructor rule.
        There are ['NamiAddr'] should be checked in variable namiToken
        Checked variables: NamiAddr
            Yes The function named 'NamiExchange' matches the contract name 'NamiExchange', which indicates that it is a constructor function in older versions of
            Solidity (prior to version 0.4.22). Therefore, this satisfies the characteristic of being a constructor.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
