Function Security Analysis for MappingTokenFactory.createTokenMapped(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function createTokenMapped.
    Check direct function security
        - function MappingTokenFactory.createTokenMapped(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not include any require/assert checks or if conditions that involve msg.sender being compared to an owner, address, Leader, or CEO.
        - function MappingTokenFactory.createTokenMapped(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not have any of the required structural characteristics such as 'require(xxx == True); xxx = False;' or 'require(xxx == False); xxx =
          True;' and similar structures mentioned in the criteria.

        - InitializableProductProxy(address(tokenMapped)).__InitializableProductProxy_init(address(this),_TokenMapped_,abi.encodeWithSignature(__TokenMapped_init(address,
        address),address(this),token)) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['InitializableProductProxy(address(tokenMapped)).__InitializableProductProxy_init(address(this),_TokenMapped_,abi.encodeWithSignature(__Toke

    Analyze External Address
        The variable 'tokenMapped' in external call 'InitializableProductProxy(address(tokenMapped)).__InitializableProductProxy_init(address(this),_TokenMapped_,abi.enco
        deWithSignature(__TokenMapped_init(address,address),address(this),token))' has no state variable assigned in MappingTokenFactory.createTokenMapped(address).
        Therefore we check whether it has been hardcoded in the function.
            No The variable 'tokenMapped' is determined at runtime within the function using dynamic parameters, specifically the 'token' address that is passed as an
            argument to the function. It is created using the create2 assembly instruction, which is dependent on the 'token' input, the chain ID, and a salted hash.
            There is no evidence of 'tokenMapped' being explicitly hardcoded in the function's logic. Instead, it results from dynamic computation based on the provided
            input.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
