    Check direct function security
        - function bebBUYtwo.DayQuKuan() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not make any checks or assertions related to specific privileged users by comparing `msg.sender` to variables that denote ownership or
          control.
        - function bebBUYtwo.DayQuKuan() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: This code does not contain the required structures for outputting 'Yes'. It primarily consists of conditional checks and user state updates without
          sequential require and assignment patterns that match any of the specified cases.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['msg.sender.transfer(_users.dayamount)', 'bebTokenTransfer.transfer(msg.sender,_bebs)', 'bebTokenTransfer.transfer(msg.sender,_values)',
    'bebTokenTransfer.transfer(msg.sender,_bebss)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - msg.sender.transfer(_users.dayamount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: This call contains
        '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - bebTokenTransfer.transfer(msg.sender,_bebs) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - bebTokenTransfer.transfer(msg.sender,_values) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - bebTokenTransfer.transfer(msg.sender,_bebss) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - bebTokenTransfer.transfer(msg.sender,_bebs) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - bebTokenTransfer.transfer(msg.sender,_values) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - bebTokenTransfer.transfer(msg.sender,_bebss) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['bebTokenTransfer.transfer(msg.sender,_bebs)', 'bebTokenTransfer.transfer(msg.sender,_values)',
    'bebTokenTransfer.transfer(msg.sender,_bebss)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['bebTokenTransfer'] should be checked in variable bebTokenTransfer
        Checked variables: bebTokenTransfer
            Yes 1. The function name 'bebBUYtwo' matches the contract's name 'bebBUYtwo', indicating it could be a constructor.  2. The state variable 'bebTokenTransfer'
            is set to 'tokenTransfer' with '_tokenAddress' as a parameter, which is not hardcoded, suggesting characteristic 2 is not satisfied. However, characteristic 1
            is satisfied.
        There are ['bebTokenTransfer'] should be checked in variable bebTokenTransfer
        Checked variables: bebTokenTransfer
            Yes The function name 'bebBUYtwo' matches the contract name 'bebBUYtwo', indicating it is likely a constructor based on typical Solidity conventions.
        There are ['bebTokenTransfer'] should be checked in variable bebTokenTransfer
        Checked variables: bebTokenTransfer
            Yes 1. The function name 'bebBUYtwo' matches the contract name, indicating it is a constructor. 2. The function contains hardcoded values for several state
            variables such as bebethex, decimals, BEBday, bebjiage, bebtime, and usdtex.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
