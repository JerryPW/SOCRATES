External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['msg.sender.send(stake)', 'whale.send(stake)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - msg.sender.send(stake) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call contains '.send(' keyword,
        indicating it is an external call that satisfies the specified characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - whale.send(stake) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call contains '.send(' keyword, indicating it
        is an external call that satisfies the specified characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
