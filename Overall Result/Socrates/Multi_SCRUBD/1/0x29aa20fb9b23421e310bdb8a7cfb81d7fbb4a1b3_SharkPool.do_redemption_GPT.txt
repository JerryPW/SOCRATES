Function Security Analysis for SharkPool.do_redemption()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function do_redemption.
    Check direct function security
        - function SharkPool.do_redemption() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function 'do_redemption' does not contain any checks or assertions involving 'msg.sender' and 'xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO' as described in the
          provided characteristics.
        - function SharkPool.do_redemption() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code provided does not match any of the specified structures. It uses 'if' statements to check conditions but none of them follow the specific
          pattern of requiring a boolean to be true or false as in the specified conditions.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['fallback', 'redeem']
        Function Security Analysis for SharkPool.fallback()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
            Check direct function security
                - function SharkPool.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain any structure verifying msg.sender against specific roles.
                - function SharkPool.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the required patterns or structures as mentioned in the characteristics. There are no require statements
                  immediately followed by changing the state of the same boolean variable, nor are there any if conditions with a throw followed by a state change of a
                  boolean variable.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['base_contract.transfer(msg.sender,remainder)', 'base_contract.transfer(owner,owner_cut)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - base_contract.transfer(msg.sender,remainder) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - base_contract.transfer(owner,owner_cut) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - base_contract.transfer(msg.sender,remainder) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - base_contract.transfer(owner,owner_cut) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['base_contract.transfer(msg.sender,remainder)', 'base_contract.transfer(owner,owner_cut)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['base_contract'] should be checked in variable base_contract
        Checked variables: base_contract
            Yes The function name is 'SharkPool', which matches the contract name 'SharkPool', indicating that this function is a constructor.
        There are ['base_contract'] should be checked in variable base_contract
        Checked variables: base_contract
            Yes The function name 'SharkPool' matches the contract name 'SharkPool', indicating that this code is a constructor. Constructors in Ethereum are executed
            once during the contract creation and therefore are related to initializing the contract state, such as the state variable 'base_contract'. Since this is a
            constructor, it satisfies the first characteristic.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
