          or CEO.

          Reason: The code doesn't have a require statement that sets a boolean to true or false. The require statement checks conditions involving the order hash and
          token user, but it does not directly set or reset a boolean variable. Hence, none of the specified structures (1, 2, 3, or 4) with mandatory and potential
          optional statements are present in this function.
