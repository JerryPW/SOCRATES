Function Security Analysis for TheWarBlueNation.Sort()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function Sort.
    Check direct function security
        - function TheWarBlueNation.Sort() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any checks on `msg.sender` for ownership or authorization as described in the required structures (1-4). It simply utilizes
          `msg.sender` to assign values to transaction data without verifying the sender's identity.
        - function TheWarBlueNation.Sort() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any structures that match the specified patterns. There are no require statements or conditional throw clauses relating to any
          boolean variable that is subsequently set to true or false. Instead, the code deals with handling transaction information and does not involve boolean state
          checks or updates as required by the provided patterns.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['fallback']
        Function Security Analysis for TheWarBlueNation.fallback()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
            Check direct function security
                - function TheWarBlueNation.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any check related to msg.sender to compare it against xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
                - function TheWarBlueNation.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain the required structures involving the variable 'xxx'. It just checks if the msg.value is greater than or equal to 0.01
                  ether and then calls a Sort function.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['owner.send(feecounter)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - owner.send(feecounter) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the '.send('
        keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
