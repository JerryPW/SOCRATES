Function Security Analysis for DecentralizedExchangeHotPotato.buy(uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function buy.
    Check direct function security
        - function DecentralizedExchangeHotPotato.buy(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code is checking if the sender is the same as the order book owner but it uses 'require(msg.sender != orderBook[_id].owner);'. This structure
          doesn't match any of the criteria specified, which include checking equality with certain roles (xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO) either directly or with
          negation in a throwing context, and the roles seem to be hardcoded or convinced to specific names. The code only checks inequality but not in the structure
          required to conclude 'Yes'.
        - function DecentralizedExchangeHotPotato.buy(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not satisfy any of the required patterns given for the "Yes" response. There are multiple require statements but none of them follow the
          specified structures. - There is a statement `require(!isContract(msg.sender));`, which resembles part of structure 3, but there is no subsequent `xxx = True;`
          statement related to `isContract(msg.sender)` or any similar variable.  Hence, the code does not match any of the structures described.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['msg.sender.transfer(msg.value-orderBook[_id].price)', 'orderBook[_id].owner.transfer(orderBook[_id].price*24/25)',
    'orderBook[_id].creator.transfer(orderBook[_id].price/50)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - msg.sender.transfer(msg.value-orderBook[_id].price) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external
        call contains the '.transfer(' keyword: 'msg.sender.transfer('.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - orderBook[_id].owner.transfer(orderBook[_id].price*24/25) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The
        external call contains the '.transfer(' keyword: 'orderBook[_id].owner.transfer('.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - orderBook[_id].creator.transfer(orderBook[_id].price/50) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The
        external call contains the '.transfer(' keyword: 'orderBook[_id].creator.transfer('.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
