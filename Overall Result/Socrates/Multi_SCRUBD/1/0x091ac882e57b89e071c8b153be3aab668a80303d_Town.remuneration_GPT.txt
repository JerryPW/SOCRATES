Function Security Analysis for Town.remuneration(uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function remuneration.
    Check direct function security
        - function Town.remuneration(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any checks that compare msg.sender to an owner/leader/CEO address using require, if, or assert. The checks involving
          msg.sender are related to token balance and allowance but do not restrict access based on an owner-specific address.
        - function Town.remuneration(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: None of the conditions specified in the task are met in the provided code. The function does not contain any require or if statements where a variable
          is checked and then reassigned according to the specified patterns.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['_token.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),restOfTokens)', 'msg.sender.transfer(address(this).balance)',
    '_token.transferFrom(msg.sender,user,amount)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - msg.sender.transfer(address(this).balance) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call
        'msg.sender.transfer(address(this).balance)' contains the '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - _token.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),restOfTokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - _token.transferFrom(msg.sender,user,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['_token.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),restOfTokens)', '_token.transferFrom(msg.sender,user,amount)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['_token'] should be checked in variable _token
        Checked variables: _token
            Yes 1. The given code includes a constructor for the contract 'Town'. The function named 'constructor' matches the characteristic of a constructor function as
            it is intended to initialize the contract's state when being deployed.  2. The state variable '_token' is being set in the constructor, not hardcoded, because
            it's being assigned the value of 'TownToken(tokenAddress)', which is passed as a parameter and not a hardcoded value.  Thus, since the constructor
            characteristic is satisfied, the output is 'Yes'.
        There are ['_token'] should be checked in variable _token
        Checked variables: _token
            Yes The provided code is a constructor for the Town contract as it is explicitly named 'constructor'.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
