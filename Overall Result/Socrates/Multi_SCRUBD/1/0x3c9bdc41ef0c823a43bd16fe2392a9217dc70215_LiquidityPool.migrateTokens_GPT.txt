Function Security Analysis for LiquidityPool.migrateTokens()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function migrateTokens.
    Check direct function security
        - function LiquidityPool.migrateTokens() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures where 'msg.sender' is compared directly to a role like xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO.
          Instead, it validates other conditions like 'thisStaker.hasMigrated', 'migrationEnabled', and previous balance transfers.
        - function LiquidityPool.migrateTokens() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: In the code, 'require(!thisStaker.hasMigrated, "You have already migrated");' is followed by 'thisStaker.hasMigrated = true;' but not immediately.
          Instead, there are multiple other statements, including other require statements and assignments, before 'thisStaker.hasMigrated = true;'. This does not meet
          the condition where the state negation operation (thisStaker.hasMigrated = true) happens immediately after checking the state with
          require(!thisStaker.hasMigrated). Therefore, the structure does not satisfy the requirement that the state negation operation is done immediately after the
          check and before the main logic.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['uniswapPair.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),previousBalance)']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - uniswapPair.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),previousBalance) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['uniswapPair.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),previousBalance)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['uniswapPair'] should be checked in variable uniswapPair
        Checked variables: uniswapPair
            Yes The provided code includes a function explicitly named 'constructor'. Inside this constructor, the state variable 'uniswapPair' is assigned a hardcoded
            contract address (0x1C608235E6A946403F2a048a38550BefE41e1B85). This satisfies both characteristics: having the function named 'constructor' and hardcoding the
            state variable.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
