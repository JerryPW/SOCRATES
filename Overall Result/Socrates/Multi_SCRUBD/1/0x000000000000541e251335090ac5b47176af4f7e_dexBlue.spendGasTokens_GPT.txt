Function Security Analysis for dexBlue.spendGasTokens(uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function spendGasTokens.
    Check direct function security
        - function dexBlue.spendGasTokens(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function `spendGasTokens` does not contain any of the specified structures where `msg.sender` is compared to an owner or leader address.
        - function dexBlue.spendGasTokens(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not contain any of the specified structures. There is no 'require' statement or an 'if' statement that throws an exception. Also, no
          boolean variable is being toggled between True and False or vice versa.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['settleReserveReserveTradeWithData', 'settleTrade', 'userSigWithdrawal', 'settleRingTrade', 'settleReserveReserveTrade',
    'batchSettleTrades', 'settleReserveTradeWithData', 'settleReserveTrade', 'settleRingTradeWithData']
        Function Security Analysis for dexBlue.settleReserveReserveTradeWithData(dexBlueStructs.TradeInputPacked,bytes32[],bytes32[])
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function settleReserveReserveTradeWithData.
            Check direct function security
                - function dexBlue.settleReserveReserveTradeWithData(dexBlueStructs.TradeInputPacked,bytes32[],bytes32[]) has no security assurance protected by checking
                the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain any condition that directly checks if 'msg.sender' is equal to or not equal to xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO using
                  require, if-else, or assert statements.
                - function dexBlue.settleReserveReserveTradeWithData(dexBlueStructs.TradeInputPacked,bytes32[],bytes32[]) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing
                a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code provided contains a `require()` statement, but it does not follow any of the specified structures. The require statement is checking a
                  conjunction of conditions rather than a single variable. Moreover, there is no subsequent assignment of a boolean variable following the require
                  statement.

            No 1. The function is named 'spendGasTokens', which does not match the contract name 'dexBlue', nor is it explicitly named 'constructor'.  2. The function
            accesses the state variable 'gas_token_nonce_tail', but its value is not hardcoded; rather, it is used as part of an assignment within the existing contract
            logic.

                There are no modifiers should be examined in function spendGasTokens.
                Check direct function security
                    - function dexBlue.spendGasTokens(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                      Reason: The function does not include any checks or conditions related to msg.sender.
                    - function dexBlue.spendGasTokens(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                      Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures in the provided options. There are no 'require' or 'if' statements that
                      directly relate to setting a boolean variable to True or False, nor are there any examples of setting a variable to one state and then changing it
                      later.
                Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
                The reachable functions are ['settleReserveReserveTradeWithData', 'settleTrade', 'userSigWithdrawal', 'settleRingTrade', 'settleReserveReserveTrade',

                        There are no modifiers should be examined in function settleReserveReserveTradeWithData.
                        Check direct function security
                            - function dexBlue.settleReserveReserveTradeWithData(dexBlueStructs.TradeInputPacked,bytes32[],bytes32[]) has no security assurance protected
                            by checking the authority of msg.sender
                              Reason: The code does not contain any check or assert statement that directly includes 'msg.sender == xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO' or
                              'msg.sender != xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO'. It uses 'require' with 'msg.sender' but only checks if it matches the 'arbiters' mapping.
                            - function dexBlue.settleReserveReserveTradeWithData(dexBlueStructs.TradeInputPacked,bytes32[],bytes32[]) has no apparent security assurance
                            by utilizing a lock machinism.
                              Reason: The code doesn't contain any of the specified structures like require(xxx == True); xxx = False; or require(xxx == False); xxx =
                              True; or require(!xxx); xxx = True; or if(!xxx) throw; xxx = true;. Therefore, it doesn't match any of the listed patterns.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
