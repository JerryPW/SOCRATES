Function Security Analysis for OpportyWhiteListHold.unlockTokens()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function unlockTokens.
    Check direct function security
        - function OpportyWhiteListHold.unlockTokens() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function check does not match any of the specified conditions regarding checking msg.sender against xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO. It checks
          msg.sender against holderList for various conditions that do not involve ownership or leadership roles.
        - function OpportyWhiteListHold.unlockTokens() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: In the function, after the require statement 'require(!holderList[msg.sender].withdrawed);', the negation operation 'holderList[msg.sender].withdrawed =
          true;' happens after the main logic of the function, which is 'OppToken.transfer(msg.sender, holderList[msg.sender].tokens);'. Therefore, the state negation
          operation is not performed immediately after checking the state of xxx using 'require' before the main logic of the function executes.

    Analyze Gas
        - OppToken.transfer(msg.sender,holderList[msg.sender].tokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['OppToken.transfer(msg.sender,holderList[msg.sender].tokens)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['OppToken'] should be checked in variable OppToken
        Checked variables: OppToken
            No The provided function is not a constructor, as it does not match the contract name 'OpportyWhiteListHold' and is not named 'constructor'. Additionally, it
            does not hardcode the state variable 'OppToken', as it sets 'OppToken' to a value based on the 'newToken' parameter, which can be dynamically updated.
            Function Security Analysis for OpportyWhiteListHold.setToken(address)
                The modifier of function setToken are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: Upon re-evaluating the code, the statement 'require(msg.sender == owner);' is correctly identified in the modifier, enforcing that only the
                      owner can access the function. This satisfies characteristic 1. No structural omissions were found related to characteristics of lock structures or
                      other access control clauses. The decision remains based solely on the presence of this statement enforcing owner access.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
