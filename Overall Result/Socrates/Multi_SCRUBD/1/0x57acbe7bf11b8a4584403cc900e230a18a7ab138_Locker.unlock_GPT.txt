    Remaining external call: ['APIX.transfer(receiver,amount)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['APIX'] should be checked in variable APIX
        Checked variables: APIX
            Yes The code provided is a constructor function as its name is 'constructor', which is explicitly mentioned in the code. Constructors are called once during
            the contract deployment and are not considered external calls during regular contract operation. The constructor does modify the state variable 'APIX', but it
            doesn't hardcode a value; instead, it assigns a value provided as a parameter, which doesn't satisfy the hardcoding condition.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
