Start analyze function: Brave3d.setName(string)
Function Security Analysis for Brave3d.setName(string)
    The modifier of function setName are ['isExistsOfNameAddressMap', 'isExistsOfAddressNameMap']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier isExistsOfNameAddressMap has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier checks whether a certain condition (_nameAddressMap[name]==0) is met and does not enforce restrictions based on the msg.sender being a
          specific address or owner nor implements a lock operation to ensure single entry execution. None of the conditions from the provided characteristics are
          satisfied.
        - modifier isExistsOfAddressNameMap has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier does not enforce ownership or restricted access based on specific addresses, nor does it involve a lock mechanism. It checks a condition on
          the _addressNameMap's value related to msg.sender.
    Check direct function security
        - function Brave3d.setName(string) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain require, if, or assert conditions that check if msg.sender is equal to any xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO variables.
        - function Brave3d.setName(string) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given function does not contain any of the specified structures like 'require(xxx == True); xxx = False;', 'require(xxx == False); xxx = True;',
          'require(!xxx); xxx = True;', or 'if(!xxx) throw; xxx = true;'. It mainly features address mapping, storage manipulation, and function calls.

Start analyze function: Brave3d.overStage(uint8)
Function Security Analysis for Brave3d.overStage(uint8)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function overStage.
    Check direct function security
        - function Brave3d.overStage(uint8) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not include any checks or assertions involving 'msg.sender', making none of the specified conditions applicable.
        - function Brave3d.overStage(uint8) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code includes the structure where it checks `assert(!finishStage.isFinish);`. However, the state negation `finishStage.isFinish = true;` occurs at
          the end of the function, not immediately after the check, and not before the main logic executes. The main logic processes before this state negation, violating
          the requirement. Thus, the code does not meet the requirements.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['buyFromValue', 'setName', 'withdraw', 'buyByName', 'buyByAddress', 'forceOverStage']
        Function Security Analysis for Brave3d.buyFromValue(uint8)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function buyFromValue.
            Check direct function security
                - function Brave3d.buyFromValue(uint8) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not involve checking if 'msg.sender' matches with any owner or specific address.
                - function Brave3d.buyFromValue(uint8) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not exhibit any of the specified structural patterns: it requires specific conditions on the 'rate' and checks balance, but
                  doesn't have toggling or conditional structures that adjust booleans as per the described patterns.
