Function Security Analysis for Crowdsale.devResWithdrawal()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function devResWithdrawal.
    Check direct function security
        - function Crowdsale.devResWithdrawal() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: Upon careful review, the function does use 'if (!(beneficiary == msg.sender)) throw;', translating to 'if (msg.sender != beneficiary) throw;', but the
          question specifies that the judgment should exclude patterns where xxx is guided by a local variable like this and not explicitly as part of structures 1, 2, 3,
          or 4. There is no such exclusive pattern directly involving 'msg.sender != xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO'.
        - function Crowdsale.devResWithdrawal() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code contains an if condition with a throw statement that checks the negation of minimumTargetReached and beneficiary == msg.sender, but it does not
          satisfy any of the specified structures because it lacks the subsequent structure of setting the variable to true within the same scope.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['beneficiary.send(resAmount)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - beneficiary.send(resAmount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the '.send('
        keyword, satisfying criterion 2.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
