Function Security Analysis for IronHands.payout()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function payout.
    Check direct function security
        - function IronHands.payout() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures that involve direct checks on msg.sender against any xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO.
        - function IronHands.payout() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function doesn't match any of the specified patterns. It has a require statement, but the variable 'balance' used in it doesn't have an assignment
          of True or False afterwards. The patterns require a specific sequence of a require statement with a specific condition and an assignment that directly
          contradicts that condition shortly after, which doesn't occur here.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.call.value(payoutToSend).gas(1000000)()', 'weak_hands.buy.value(investment).gas(1000000)(msg.sender)']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - The gas limit in participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.call.value(payoutToSend).gas(1000000)() is 1000000, which is too high. Therefore, it will not prevent
        REE problem.
        - The gas limit in weak_hands.buy.value(investment).gas(1000000)(msg.sender) is 1000000, which is too high. Therefore, it will not prevent REE problem.
    Remaining external call: ['participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.call.value(payoutToSend).gas(1000000)()',
    'weak_hands.buy.value(investment).gas(1000000)(msg.sender)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['participants'] should be checked in variable participants
        Checked variables: participants
            No The provided functions 'deposit' and 'payout' do not constitute constructors, as their names do not match the contract name 'IronHands' and neither are
            they explicitly named 'constructor'. Moreover, the function 'deposit', which manipulates the state variable 'participants', does not hardcode it but
            dynamically pushes new entries into it based on the function logic. Therefore, neither condition is satisfied.
            Function Security Analysis for IronHands.deposit()
                There are no modifiers should be examined in function deposit.
                Check direct function security
                    - function IronHands.deposit() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                      Reason: The code does not contain any patterns related to the characteristics outlined, such as checking if msg.sender equals or not equals to
                      specific roles like Owner, Address, Leader, or CEO.
                    - function IronHands.deposit() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                      Reason: The given code does not contain any variable assignment structure that fits the required criteria.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
