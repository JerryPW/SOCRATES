Function Security Analysis for GAME.startRaffle(uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function startRaffle.
    Check direct function security
        - function GAME.startRaffle(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not use any of the structures specified to check the sender's address against a specific owner, address, or role, e.g.,
          xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
        - function GAME.startRaffle(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon reviewing the code again, the statement `require(ticketsBought == ticketPool);` is present. However, there is no statement setting `ticketsBought`
          to `False` following this, as `ticketsBought` is reset to `0`, not explicitly to `False`. Additionally, there are no matching structures in the code that adhere
          strictly to the patterns of 2, 3, or 4. The initial judgment was incorrect due to an oversight in matching both required statements in the specific patterns.
          Hence, the code does not satisfy any of the specified structures.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

                - function usingOraclize.__callback(bytes32,string) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The provided code does not include any checks or conditions involving `msg.sender` against specific addresses or roles like xxxOwner,
                  xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO. It simply calls another function `__callback` with different parameters.
                - function usingOraclize.__callback(bytes32,string) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code provided does not contain statements that match any of the specified structures involving requirements or conditions manipulating a

        contains the '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - winner.transfer(winnerPrize.add((jackpot.mul(jackpotFactor)).div(100))) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the
        reason: The call 'winner.transfer(winnerPrize.add((jackpot.mul(jackpotFactor)).div(100)))' contains the '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.

        There are ['bank'] should be checked in variable bank
        Checked variables: bank
            Yes The function name 'GAME' matches the contract name, indicating that it is a constructor. This satisfies the first characteristic of the conditions
            provided.
        There are ['bonus'] should be checked in variable bonus
        Checked variables: bonus
            Yes The function provided is named 'GAME', which matches the contract name 'GAME'. Therefore, it is recognized as a constructor function in the context of
            Solidity. Constructor functions in Solidity are special functions used to initialize a contract's state when it is created.

          Reason: There are no checks on msg.sender related to owner or leader roles like Owner, Address, Leader, or CEO.
        - function GAME.fillFromQueue() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code provided does not match any of the specified structures (1 through 4). The code does not contain any 'require' or 'if(!xxx) throw' statements,
          and there are no consecutive statements setting a variable to 'true' or 'false' as required by the structures.

                  (msg.sender). It simply calls another function with a slightly different signature.
                - function usingOraclize.__callback(bytes32,string) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code provided does not meet any of the specified structures. It does not contain any `require` statement or `if` checks with a corresponding

    Analyze External Address
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            Yes The provided function is a constructor because its name matches the contract name 'GAME'. This follows the pattern before Solidity 0.4.22, where
            constructors were defined by naming them the same as the contract.
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            Yes The function name 'GAME' matches the contract name 'GAME', indicating that it is a constructor. In Solidity, constructors are identified by a function
            whose name matches the contract name in older versions of Solidity. Thus, it satisfies the first characteristic.
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            Yes The function name 'GAME' matches the contract name 'GAME', indicating that this is likely the constructor of the contract. The code does not involve
            hardcoding a state variable called 'token'.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Function Security Analysis for usingOraclize.oraclize_randomDS_getSessionPubKeyHash()
    The modifier of function oraclize_randomDS_getSessionPubKeyHash are ['oraclizeAPI']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier oraclizeAPI has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier 'oraclizeAPI' does not contain any code ensuring only the owner or specific addresses can execute the function. It also lacks any locking
          mechanism ensuring single entry, nor is the function name indicative of such protections ('oraclizeAPI' does not suggest owner-only or non-reentrant behavior).
    Check direct function security
        - function usingOraclize.oraclize_randomDS_getSessionPubKeyHash() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not include any condition checking the identity of the msg.sender or similar address verification with keywords like Owner, Address,
          Leader, or CEO as described in the rules.
        - function usingOraclize.oraclize_randomDS_getSessionPubKeyHash() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code doesn't contain any of the specified structures with variables and statements that match the provided patterns.

                - function GAME.getRandom() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The given function does not contain any structure as per the provided patterns. There is no require or if statement checking a condition
                  involving a variable (represented as xxx), and then changing the value of the same variable xxx afterward. The assignments and logic in the function
                  only handle variable initializations and conditional logic without the required structural elements involving condition checks and mutations as
                  specified.

                        - function GAME.fillFromQueue() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified patterns that involve `require` or `if` statements with subsequent state changes. It uses
                          conditionals and state updates but none following the described structures involving `require` or `if(!xxx) throw;` statements followed by
                          updates to the same variable.

                Function Security Analysis for usingOraclize.__callback(bytes32,string)
                    There are no modifiers should be examined in function __callback.
                    Check direct function security
                        - function usingOraclize.__callback(bytes32,string) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                          Reason: The function does not contain any require, if, or assert statements involving msg.sender with xxxOwner-type checks.
                        - function usingOraclize.__callback(bytes32,string) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                          Reason: The given code does not contain any of the specified structures. There are no 'require' or 'if' statements, nor are there variable
                          assignments to true or false.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: []
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
