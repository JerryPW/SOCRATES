Function Security Analysis for HeroLedger.collect(uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function collect.
    Check direct function security
        - function HeroLedger.collect(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not check if msg.sender is equal or not equal to owner, address, leader, or CEO.
        - function HeroLedger.collect(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not have a require statement that checks if a variable is true or false, followed by setting that same variable to the opposite of the
          checked condition. The require statement checks for a balance condition, and the if statement checks the result of a token transfer.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['erc20.transfer(msg.sender,amount)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - erc20.transfer(msg.sender,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - erc20.transfer(msg.sender,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['erc20.transfer(msg.sender,amount)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['erc20'] should be checked in variable erc20
        Checked variables: erc20
            No The provided smart contract code includes a function named 'setERC20Address', which is not the same as the contract name 'HeroLedger' and is not explicitly
            named 'constructor', so it does not satisfy the constructor characteristic. The function does not hardcode the state variable 'erc20'; instead, it assigns
            'erc20' to 'candidateContract', which is determined at runtime by the parameter '_address'. Therefore, it does not satisfy the second characteristic either.
            Function Security Analysis for HeroLedger.setERC20Address(address,uint256,uint256)
                The modifier of function setERC20Address are ['onlyLeader']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyLeader is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The modifier contains the statement 'require(msg.sender == leaderAddress);', matching the characteristic that verifies ownership or specific
                      addresses (rule 1). There are no lock and unlock operations present in the modifier, so rule 2 does not apply. Thus, the judgment based on rule 1 is
                      correct.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
