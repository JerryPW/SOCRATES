Function Security Analysis for Swap.fallback()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
    Check direct function security
        - function Swap.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: There are no conditions checking if msg.sender is equal or not equal to any 'Owner', 'Leader', or 'CEO' variables.
        - function Swap.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does contain a structure that satisfies the requirements to match either Structure 1, 2, 3, or 4, specifically Structure 2:
          'require(check[msg.sender] == false);' is followed by 'check[msg.sender] = true;'. However, the state change through 'check[msg.sender] = true;' does not occur
          immediately after the require statement but instead after the main logic of the function is executed. Thus, it does not satisfy the requirement where the
          negation operation must occur immediately after the check, before the main function logic. Thus, based on the provided criteria, the output should be 'No'.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['beneficiary.send(msg.value)', 'swapaddress.transfer(msg.sender,amount/secondvalue)', 'swapaddress.transfer(msg.sender,amount/third)',
    'swapaddress.transfer(msg.sender,amount/newvalue)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - beneficiary.send(msg.value) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains '.send('
        keyword, fulfilling the second characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - swapaddress.transfer(msg.sender,amount/secondvalue) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - swapaddress.transfer(msg.sender,amount/third) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - swapaddress.transfer(msg.sender,amount/newvalue) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['swapaddress.transfer(msg.sender,amount/secondvalue)', 'swapaddress.transfer(msg.sender,amount/third)',
    'swapaddress.transfer(msg.sender,amount/newvalue)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['swapaddress'] should be checked in variable swapaddress
        Checked variables: swapaddress
            Yes The provided code is a constructor, as indicated by the function name being 'constructor'. Furthermore, the constructor function directly sets the state
            variable 'swapaddress' using a parameter value without hardcoding it, so it doesn't match the second characteristic. However, it satisfies the first
            characteristic because it is a constructor.
        There are ['swapaddress'] should be checked in variable swapaddress
        Checked variables: swapaddress
            Yes The code provided is a constructor for the contract 'Swap'. This is determined by the use of the keyword 'constructor'. In the constructor, the state
            variable 'swapaddress' is set to the result of the function 'collectible(addressOfCollectibleUsedAsReward)', which is not a hardcoded value but computed at
            runtime from the parameter 'addressOfCollectibleUsedAsReward'. However, meeting criterion 1 alone (being a constructor) is enough to satisfy the requirement.
        There are ['swapaddress'] should be checked in variable swapaddress
        Checked variables: swapaddress
            Yes The function in the provided code is named 'constructor', which is explicitly a constructor function by definition. The state variable 'swapaddress' is
            being assigned the value derived from the parameter 'addressOfCollectibleUsedAsReward' and is not hardcoded in the constructor.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
