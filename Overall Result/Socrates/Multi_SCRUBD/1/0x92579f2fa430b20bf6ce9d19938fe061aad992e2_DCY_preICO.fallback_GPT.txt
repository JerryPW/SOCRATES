Function Security Analysis for DCY_preICO.fallback()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
    Check direct function security
        - function DCY_preICO.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not include any of the required authority check structures as specified in the criteria.
        - function DCY_preICO.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does have `require(!crowdsaleClosed);`, but the negation operation, `crowdsaleClosed = true;`, doesn't occur immediately after the require
          statement and several lines of main logic are executed before potentially setting `crowdsaleClosed` to true. Thus, it does not immediately perform a state
          negation operation on `crowdsaleClosed` after checking.
