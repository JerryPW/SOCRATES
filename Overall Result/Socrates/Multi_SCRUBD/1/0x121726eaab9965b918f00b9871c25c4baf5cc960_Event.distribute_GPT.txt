Function Security Analysis for Event.distribute()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function distribute.
    Check direct function security
        - function Event.distribute() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function 'distribute' does not have any checks or conditions involving 'msg.sender', specifically comparing it to an
          'xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO'.
        - function Event.distribute() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not match any of the specified structures. There are no require statements checking for a boolean variable assigned to a different value
          later, nor a throw statement.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['attendees[i].call.value(reward)()']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - attendees[i].call.value(reward)() ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['attendees[i].call.value(reward)()']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['attendees'] should be checked in variable attendees
        Checked variables: attendees
            No 1. The function is named 'register', and the contract name is 'Event'. The function name does not match the contract name, and it is not explicitly named
            'constructor', so it does not satisfy the constructor requirement. 2. The state variable 'attendees' is used in the function, but it is not hardcoded with a
            specific value in the function body, so it does not satisfy the state variable check requirement.
            Function Security Analysis for Event.register(address,uint256)
                There are no modifiers should be examined in function register.
                Check direct function security
                    - function Event.register(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                      Reason: The code does not contain any checks involving 'msg.sender' and does not compare it with any specific roles like Owner, Address, Leader, or
                      CEO.
                    - function Event.register(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                      Reason: The code doesn't follow any of the structures mentioned. It contains a require statement with a condition (states[_attendee] ==
                      ATTENDEE_UNREGISTERED), but it doesn't have any subsequent statement setting the value to either false (or equivalent) or a subsequent true as
                      necessary per the structures.
                Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
                The reachable functions are ['register']
                    Function Security Analysis for Event.register()
                        There are no modifiers should be examined in function register.
                        Check direct function security
                            - function Event.register() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                              Reason: The code does not contain any of the specific patterns involving checking 'msg.sender' against 'xxxOwner', 'xxxAddress', 'Leader',
                              or 'CEO'. It simply calls a 'register' function with 'msg.sender' and 'msg.value' as arguments.
                            - function Event.register() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                              Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures such as require statements checking boolean conditions or conditional
                              throws related to variable assignments.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
