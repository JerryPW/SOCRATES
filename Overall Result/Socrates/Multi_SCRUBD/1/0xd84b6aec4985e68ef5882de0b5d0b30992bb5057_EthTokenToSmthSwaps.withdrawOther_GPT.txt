        There are ['swaps'] should be checked in variable swap
        Checked variables: swaps
            No None of the functions provided in the code segment are constructors since none of them have the same name as the contract "EthTokenToSmthSwaps" or are
            explicitly named "constructor". Additionally, the state variable "swaps" is used within various functions, but there are no hardcoded values assigned directly
            to "swaps" in any of the function implementations. Each interaction with "swaps" involves dynamic input and manipulation based on passed parameters or
            conditions.
            Function Security Analysis for EthTokenToSmthSwaps.createSwap(bytes20,address,uint256,address)
                There are no modifiers should be examined in function createSwap.
                Check direct function security
                    - function EthTokenToSmthSwaps.createSwap(bytes20,address,uint256,address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                      Reason: The code does not contain any checks using msg.sender against specific owner-like addresses or roles.
                    - function EthTokenToSmthSwaps.createSwap(bytes20,address,uint256,address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                      Reason: The provided code does not match any of the specified patterns. None of the require statements involve checking boolean variables for
                      True/False, nor do they involve setting any such variables after a require statement.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
