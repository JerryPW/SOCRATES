    There are no modifiers should be examined in function matchOrderWithReserve.
    Check direct function security
        - function dexBlueSettlementModule.matchOrderWithReserve(dexBlueStructs.Order,address,dexBlueStructs.ReserveTrade) has no security assurance protected by checking
        the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function code does not include any checks or require/assert statements that match the provided characteristics (e.g., checks involving msg.sender
          with Owner/Address/Leader/CEO).
        - function dexBlueSettlementModule.matchOrderWithReserve(dexBlueStructs.Order,address,dexBlueStructs.ReserveTrade) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing
        a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided function does not contain any of the specified structures. It uses an if statement to check multiple conditions for a successful reserve
          trade but does not include the require statement or a pattern where a variable is set to true or false following strict conditions as described in the
          characteristics.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['batchSettleTrades', 'settleReserveTrade']
        Function Security Analysis for dexBlueSettlementModule.batchSettleTrades(dexBlueStructs.OrderInputPacked[],dexBlueStructs.TradeInputPacked[])
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function batchSettleTrades.
            Check direct function security
                - function dexBlueSettlementModule.batchSettleTrades(dexBlueStructs.OrderInputPacked[],dexBlueStructs.TradeInputPacked[]) has no security assurance
                protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code checks whether the function caller is in the 'arbiters' mapping but does not have any direct restrictions involving specific roles like
                  'Owner', 'Address', 'Leader', or 'CEO'. Therefore, it doesn't match any of the specified patterns.
                - function dexBlueSettlementModule.batchSettleTrades(dexBlueStructs.OrderInputPacked[],dexBlueStructs.TradeInputPacked[]) has no apparent security
                assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code does not satisfy any of the specified structural patterns. There is a require statement, but it does not involve setting a
                  variable true or false according to the given conditions.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call:
    ['address(this).call.gas(trade.gasLimit)(abi.encodePacked(dexBlue(address(0)).executeReserveTrade.selector,abi.encode(order.sellToken,trade.orderAmount-

        - address(this).call.gas(trade.gasLimit)(abi.encodePacked(dexBlue(address(0)).executeReserveTrade.selector,abi.encode(order.sellToken,trade.orderAmount-
        trade.reserveFee,order.buyToken,trade.reserveAmount-trade.reserveRebate,reserve))) is subjected to gas limits trade.gasLimit <= 3000. Therefore, it has no
        potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The series of functions provided is empty, meaning there are no operations or assignments being made to the variable
        'trade.gasLimit'. Consequently, without any code to modify or assign a new value to 'trade.gasLimit', we assume its value remains unchanged from its initial state
        or default value.  In typical programming environments, if 'trade.gasLimit' is an uninitialized or default-initialized variable, it may be set to zero or another
        initial value that is indeed less than 3000. However, without explicit code modifying this variable, we cannot definitively conclude any value for
        'trade.gasLimit' or assume it is always less or equal to 3000 without more context on its initial setup or persistence in state/configuration. Given no
        operations, we lean towards assuming no conditions are violated regarding it breaching a 3000 threshold considering only what is directly provided.
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
