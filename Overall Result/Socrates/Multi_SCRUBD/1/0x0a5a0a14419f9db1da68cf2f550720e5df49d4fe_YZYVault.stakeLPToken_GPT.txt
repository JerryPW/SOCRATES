Function Security Analysis for YZYVault.stakeLPToken(uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function stakeLPToken.
    Check direct function security
        - function YZYVault.stakeLPToken(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: None of the conditions or checks in the code provided relate to comparing msg.sender with an owner or specific privileged addresses like
          Owner/Leader/CEO.
        - function YZYVault.stakeLPToken(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon reviewing the code again, there is the statement 'require(!isContract(_msgSender()), ...);', which fits the initial part of structure 3
          ('require(!xxx);'). However, there is no statement consistent with 'xxx = True;' following this. The function's logic continues without changing the value of
          'isContract'. Therefore, the function does not fully satisfy any of the specified structures as both required statements are not present. Only one part of the
          structure is matched, not both statements needed.

                The modifier of function changeYzyETHPair are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The code contains 'require(_owner == _msgSender())', which enforces that only the owner can execute the function. This matches rule 1, which
                      confirms that the function has an ownership control structure.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

    Check direct function security
        - function YZYVault._sendLotteryAmount() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified patterns that restrict access based on the msg.sender being a specific owner or address, such as
          require(msg.sender == ...), if (msg.sender != ...), or assert(msg.sender == ...).
        - function YZYVault._sendLotteryAmount() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code checks a condition with `!_enabledLottery`, but it does not subsequently set `_enabledLottery` to `true`. Therefore, the function does not
          match any of the specified patterns, i.e., setting a boolean variable after a check with `require`, `if` statements, and optional toggling back. Consequently,
          the answer is 'No'.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

                The modifier of function changeYzyAddress are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The modifier `onlyOwner()` contains the statement `require(_owner == _msgSender())`, which is a direct enforcement that only the owner can
                      execute the function, thus satisfying Rule 1. There is no need to check for Rule 2, as Rule 1 is already satisfied. No structural omissions are
                      found as Rule 1 criteria is clearly met.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

    Check direct function security
        - function YZYVault.claimYzyReward() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any access control mechanisms related to 'msg.sender'. It doesn't check if 'msg.sender' is equal to any specific owner or
          leader address, nor does it ensure the caller is in an authorized role.
        - function YZYVault.claimYzyReward() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not match any of the required structures. The function 'claimYzyReward' does not have a require statement followed by an assignment to a
          boolean variable 'xxx' with the specific values 'True' or 'False' as per the given structures.

        Checked variables: _yzy
            No The function 'changeYzyAddress' is neither a constructor nor does it hardcode the '_yzy' state variable. The function accesses the '_yzy' state variable
            via a parameter 'yzy' passed to it, thus allowing for dynamic assignment rather than hardcoding. Additionally, the function name does not match the contract
            name 'YZYVault', nor is it named 'constructor'.
            Function Security Analysis for YZYVault.changeYzyAddress(address)
                The modifier of function changeYzyAddress are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The judgment is based on the first rule. The code in the modifier enforces that only the owner can execute the function by using the
                      statement require(_owner == _msgSender(), "Ownable: caller is not the owner"). This matches the specified structure for checking ownership.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

    There are no modifiers should be examined in function claimSwapReward.
    Check direct function security
        - function YZYVault.claimSwapReward() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not have any of the specific patterns such as require, if conditions, or assert related to msg.sender and predefined roles like Owner or
          Address. It only operates on msg.sender with context-specific methods and manipulations, without access restriction based on msg.sender role.
        - function YZYVault.claimSwapReward() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures, such as checking a condition with 'require' or throwing an exception based on a boolean
          'xxx', and subsequently changing the value of 'xxx'.

            named 'constructor'.  2. The state variable '_yzy' is not hardcoded in the function 'changeYzyAddress'. It is assigned a value based on the parameter 'yzy',
            which is passed to the function during its execution.  Since neither characteristic is met, the answer is 'No'.
            Function Security Analysis for YZYVault.changeYzyAddress(address)
                The modifier of function changeYzyAddress are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The modifier uses 'require(_owner == _msgSender())' statement to check if the caller is the owner, enforcing that only the owner can execute
                      the function. This matches characteristic 1 as listed. There are no structural omissions for this characteristic. Characteristic 2 is not applicable
                      since the code does not contain locking or unlocking operations.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

        - function YZYVault.safeYzyTransfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not have any of the specified structures. It does not use a 'require' statement or 'if(!xxx) throw' pattern with variable toggling
          of true/false.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

            There are no modifiers should be examined in function stake.
            Check direct function security
                - function YZYVault.stake() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code checks for contract addresses and minimum deposit but does not match any of the predefined structures where msg.sender is compared to
                  an owner or similar roles.
                - function YZYVault.stake() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: Upon reviewing the code again, there is 'require(!isContract(_msgSender()), ...)', but there is no subsequent statement
                  'isContract(_msgSender()) = True;'. Therefore, the structure is incomplete based on the specified patterns which require both statements to be present.
                  Hence, none of the full structures are matched.

            No The function 'changeYzyAddress' neither has the name of the contract 'YZYVault' nor is it named 'constructor', so it is not a constructor. Additionally,
            the function does not have any hardcoded value for the state variable '_yzy', as it assigns '_yzy' based on the input parameter 'yzy'. The state variable is
            set by a dynamic address input, not a hardcoded value.
            Function Security Analysis for YZYVault.changeYzyAddress(address)
                The modifier of function changeYzyAddress are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The code in the modifier uses a `require` statement that checks if the `_msgSender()` is equal to `_owner`, which matches characteristic 1,
                      indicating enforcement of owner-only access.
        There are ['_yzy'] should be checked in variable _yzy
        Checked variables: _yzy
            No The provided code does not match the contract name (YZYVault) and is not explicitly named 'constructor', so it is not a constructor function. The state
            variable '_yzy' is not hardcoded in the provided function; it is set based on the input parameter value 'yzy', which is determined at runtime. Therefore,
            neither of the specified characteristics are satisfied.
            Function Security Analysis for YZYVault.changeYzyAddress(address)
                The modifier of function changeYzyAddress are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: Rechecking the code, the modifier `onlyOwner` contains a `require` statement with the condition `_owner == _msgSender()`. This matches rule
                      1, where the modifier enforces that only the owner can execute the function. There are no indications of a locking mechanism that would satisfy rule
                      2. Thus, the previous judgment remains correct according to rule 1.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: 1. The modifier enforces that only the owner can execute the function. It uses `require(_owner == _msgSender())` to check if the caller is
                      the owner.
            There are ['_weth'] should be checked in variable _weth
            Checked variables: _weth
                Yes The given code is a constructor of the contract YZYVault. This is determined by the presence of the function named 'constructor', which is explicitly
                indicated in the code. The code initializes various state variables, including '_weth'. However, the '_weth' variable is not hardcoded but rather is
                assigned a value through a parameter passed to the constructor. Hence, only the first characteristic is satisfied.
            There are ['_weth'] should be checked in variable _weth
            Checked variables: _weth
                Yes The provided code is indeed a constructor for the contract named 'YZYVault'. This is evident because the function name is 'constructor', which
                explicitly makes it a constructor function. Constructors do not follow the rule of having the same name as the contract after Solidity version 0.4.22, and
                instead use 'constructor' as the keyword to define them. Therefore, the code satisfies the first characteristic for checking a constructor.
        There are ['_uniswapV2Router'] should be checked in variable _uniswapV2Router
        Checked variables: _uniswapV2Router
            Yes The given code represents a constructor function for the smart contract named YZYVault. This is evident because the function is explicitly defined as a
            'constructor', which satisfies the first characteristic for determining the function's significance according to the provided rules. Even though the state
            variable '_uniswapV2Router' is hardcoded within the constructor function, the primary reason this function satisfies the characteristic is that it is a
            constructor; therefore, the function satisfies the condition.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
