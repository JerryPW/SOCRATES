    Check direct function security
        - function MonkeyScam.determinePID(LDdatasets.EventReturns) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not include any mechanism for checking the identity of 'msg.sender' against any predefined owner, address, leader, or CEO as specified
          in the criteria. It only uses 'msg.sender' to fetch player data or sets up player details without any ownership or authorization checks.
        - function MonkeyScam.determinePID(LDdatasets.EventReturns) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the structures specified in the characteristics checklist.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['fallback', 'buyXid', 'buyXname', 'buyXaddr']
        Function Security Analysis for MonkeyScam.fallback()
            The modifier of function fallback are ['isActivated', 'isHuman', 'isWithinLimits']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier isActivated has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier 'isActivated' does not meet any of the specified conditions. The code checks whether 'activated_' is true, which does not
                  correspond to any of the criteria: owner-based access control, lock operation, or relevant naming conventions like Onlyxxx or nonReentrant.
                - modifier isHuman has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier isHuman restricts execution based on the condition that the caller is not a smart contract, but it does not enforce ownership or
                  specific address-based access, nor does it involve lock operations. The naming 'isHuman' does not imply ownership or non-reentrancy protection either.
                - modifier isWithinLimits has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier isWithinLimits enforces limits on the value of Ether passed to the function but does not restrict access to specific owners or
                  addresses, nor does it include any lock operations. It also doesn't suggest security through its name.
            Check direct function security
                - function MonkeyScam.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain a condition where the execution depends on the msg.sender to be a specific owner or leader.  There are no require, if,
                  assert statements involving msg.sender == xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.  Therefore, it doesn't match any of the structures listed.
                - function MonkeyScam.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the required structures with 'require' or 'if' statements for variable manipulation as specified.
