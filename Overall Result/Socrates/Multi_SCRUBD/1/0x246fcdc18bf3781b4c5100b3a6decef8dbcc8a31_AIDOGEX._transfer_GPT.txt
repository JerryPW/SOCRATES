Function Security Analysis for AIDOGEX._transfer(address,address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _transfer.
    Check direct function security
        - function AIDOGEX._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain checks involving msg.sender compared to any xxxOwner or similar roles.
        - function AIDOGEX._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures from the provided criteria. It contains checks for 'require(from != address(0)' and
          'require(amount > 0)', but these do not match the required patterns (like changing the same variable state after a require or if statement). Further,
          'inSwapAndLiquify = true' appears without an initial require or if check as described in the patterns.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transfer', 'transferFrom']
        Function Security Analysis for AIDOGEX.transfer(address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transfer.
            Check direct function security
                - function AIDOGEX.transfer(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified checks for msg.sender against an owner or specific address.
                - function AIDOGEX.transfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code provided does not contain any of the specified structures. There are no require or if statements that check a condition on a variable
                  and then change the state of that variable. The function simply calls _transfer and returns true, without any of the required structure patterns.

    Analyze External Address
        There are ['uniswapV2Router'] should be checked in variable uniswapV2Router
        Checked variables: uniswapV2Router
            Yes The provided code defines a function named 'constructor', which aligns with the characteristic of being a constructor as specified in the rule.
            Constructors in Solidity are special functions used to initialize state variables and set up the contract when it is deployed. This is clearly a constructor
            function because it is explicitly named 'constructor'.
        There are ['marketingWallet'] should be checked in variable marketingWallet
        Checked variables: marketingWallet
            Yes 1. The given code is a constructor, as indicated by the presence of the function specifically named 'constructor'. This matches characteristic 1. 2.
            Additionally, the state variable 'marketingWallet' is hardcoded within the constructor with the value '0xF88Db7a0e6fA4f0a36Bfc0e71AcC3F587aCCd700', thus
            satisfying characteristic 2.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Function Security Analysis for AIDOGEX.buybackAndBurn(uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function buybackAndBurn.
    Check direct function security
        - function AIDOGEX.buybackAndBurn(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any conditionals or assertions that check the "msg.sender" against any kind of owner, address, or role like Leader/CEO.
        - function AIDOGEX.buybackAndBurn(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code snippet does not contain any of the four specified structures. There is no 'require' statement or an 'if' statement with a 'throw',
          nor are there variable assignments that match the described patterns.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transfer', '_transfer', 'transferFrom']
        Function Security Analysis for AIDOGEX.transfer(address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transfer.
            Check direct function security
                - function AIDOGEX.transfer(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not include any statements that verify whether msg.sender is the owner, address, leader, or CEO. Therefore, it does not meet
                  any of the specified conditions.
                - function AIDOGEX.transfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures, such as a conditional check using 'require' or 'if', followed by assignments to the
                  same variable.

        There are ['uniswapV2Router'] should be checked in variable uniswapV2Router
        Checked variables: uniswapV2Router
            Yes The code provided is a constructor because its name is 'constructor', which explicitly matches the condition for being recognized as a constructor
            function. Constructors often serve to initialize state variables and set up the contract when it is deployed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
