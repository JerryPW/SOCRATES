Function Security Analysis for GMI2.forceSwapAndSendDividends(uint256)
    The modifier of function forceSwapAndSendDividends are ['onlyOwner']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The modifier uses require(_owner == _msgSender(), "Ownable: caller is not the owner"), which clearly matches the criteria of enforcing that only the
          owner can execute the function by checking the sender's address against the owner's address. There is no structural omission because this statement exactly
          meets the rule of checking the ownership requirement without any need for additional conditions or statements. There are no lock operations present, so Rule 2
          does not apply, but Rule 1 is fully satisfied.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
