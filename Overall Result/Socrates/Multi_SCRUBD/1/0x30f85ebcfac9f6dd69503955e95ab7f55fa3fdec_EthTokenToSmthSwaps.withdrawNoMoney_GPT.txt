        Checked variables: swaps
            No The code provided does not contain a constructor function. The contract name is 'EthTokenToSmthSwaps', and none of the functions appear to be a constructor
            as their names do not match the contract name, nor is any function explicitly declared as 'constructor'. Additionally, the state variable 'swaps' is used in
            the functions, but its usage is not hardcoded into the logic (e.g., there are no specific hardcoded values assigned to 'swaps'). All interactions with 'swaps'
            are based on dynamic values passed as parameters or those determined during the execution of the contract.

                Check direct function security
                    - function EthTokenToSmthSwaps.createSwap(bytes20,address,uint256,address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                      Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures involving msg.sender with specific roles such as xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader,
                      CEO.
                    - function EthTokenToSmthSwaps.createSwap(bytes20,address,uint256,address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                      Reason: The code does not match any of the provided structures, as it does not have a require statement checking for a variable's boolean state
                      followed by an assignment changing that state.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
