    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _transfer.
    Check direct function security
        - function ChipToken._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any checks or restrictions related to msg.sender being compared with xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO type variables. The
          security mechanisms implemented revolve around conditions such as addresses not being zero, not being blacklisted, or exceeding certain limits.
        - function ChipToken._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon re-evaluating the code, it utilizes `require(!blacklist[from] && !blacklist[to], ...)`, which matches the structure `{require(!xxx)}`. However,
          there is no subsequent `xxx = True;` statement found in the code to complete the structural requirements. Thus, none of the specified patterns are fully matched
          in the code, making the initial judgment incorrect.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transfer', 'transferFrom']

            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transfer.
            Check direct function security
                - function ChipToken.transfer(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain any checks or assertions involving msg.sender and xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
                - function ChipToken.transfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code does not contain the structure where a require or if statement conditionally checks a boolean variable followed by changing
                  the state of that variable as specified in the given criteria. There are no require or if statements at all, and no boolean variables being set to True
                  or False within conditional checks provided in the structure list.

Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: ChipToken.swap()
Function Security Analysis for ChipToken.swap()
    The modifier of function swap are ['lockTheSwap']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier lockTheSwap is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The modifier 'lockTheSwap' contains both necessary elements for a lock operation: 1. It sets 'inSwap' to true before the function execution. 2. It
          resets 'inSwap' to false after the function execution.  This ensures the function adheres to the lock operation condition as described in Rule 2.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
