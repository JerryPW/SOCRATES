Function Security Analysis for RuneLock.lockTokens(address,uint256,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function lockTokens.
    Check direct function security
        - function RuneLock.lockTokens(address,uint256,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: There are no checks or assertions that require msg.sender specifically to be a certain owner, address, or CEO before continuing execution in the
          provided code.
        - function RuneLock.lockTokens(address,uint256,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided function does not match any of the specified code structures. There are no require statements or if statements in the exact format
          specified in the characteristics.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['address(fee1Address).call{value:lockCost*98/100}()', 'address(fee2Address).call{value:lockCost*2/100}()',

    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - address(fee1Address).call{value:lockCost*98/100}() ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - address(fee2Address).call{value:lockCost*2/100}() ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - token.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),_amountToLock) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['address(fee1Address).call{value:lockCost*98/100}()', 'address(fee2Address).call{value:lockCost*2/100}()',
    'token.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),_amountToLock)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['fee1Address'] should be checked in variable fee1Address
        Checked variables: fee1Address
            No The provided function is named `updateFeeAddress`, which is not the same as the contract name `RuneLock` and is not explicitly declared as a 'constructor'.
            This means it does not satisfy the first characteristic.   The function `updateFeeAddress` updates the state variable `fee1Address` with a new address
            provided during the function call. This is not considered hardcoding because hardcoding refers to setting a variable to a fixed value directly within the
            function code, not assignable by input or otherwise changeable. Therefore, it does not satisfy the second characteristic either.
            Function Security Analysis for RuneLock.updateFeeAddress(address)
                The modifier of function updateFeeAddress are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: Upon re-evaluating the code, the require statement `require(msg.sender == owner);` explicitly enforces that only the owner can execute the
                      function. This specifically matches characteristic 1, ensuring that the execution is restricted to the owner's address. There are no structural
                      omissions, as this directly relates to the rule that checks ownership authority mentioned in characteristic 1. There is no indication of lock
                      operations in this particular code snippet, so characteristic 2 is not applicable.
        There are ['fee2Address'] should be checked in variable fee2Address
        Checked variables: fee2Address
            State variable fee2Address has initialized in public area after declaration.
        The variable 'token' in external call 'token.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),_amountToLock)' has no state variable assigned in
        RuneLock.lockTokens(address,uint256,uint256). Therefore we check whether it has been hardcoded in the function.
            No The function uses `_tokenAddress` as an input parameter and does not substitute it with a hardcoded value within the function's definition. The address
            value is defined by the caller when the function is invoked, making it flexible and not hardcoded.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
