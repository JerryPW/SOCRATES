    There are no modifiers should be examined in function mintProof.
    Check direct function security
        - function BlackErc20.mintProof(uint256,address,bytes32[]) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any specific statements that compare `msg.sender` against an owner, leader, CEO, or similar privileged role to control
          execution based on the sender identity.
        - function BlackErc20.mintProof(uint256,address,bytes32[]) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function does not contain any structure as described in the given rules. It mainly involves checking various conditions with `require` statements,
          processing token transactions, and updating counters, but does not exhibit the specified variable assignment and condition pattern.

            No 1. The function name 'setLPContract' does not match the contract name 'BlackErc20', nor is it explicitly named 'constructor'. This indicates that the code
            provided is not a constructor, so characteristic 1 is not satisfied.  2. The function 'setLPContract' does not have hardcoded state variables. The value of
            'lpContract' is set using the parameter 'lp', which is provided at runtime and not hardcoded within the function. Thus, characteristic 2 is not satisfied.
            Function Security Analysis for BlackErc20.setLPContract(address)
                The modifier of function setLPContract are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: Upon re-evaluating the code, the modifier `onlyOwner` indicates that it likely checks if the caller is an owner based on its naming.
                      However, the modulation code itself doesn't explicitly contain any enforcement condition visible here, but the name `onlyOwner` suggests it is for
                      access control by owner. This inference is considered based on rule 3 and aligns correctly with the instruction given the name implication.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
