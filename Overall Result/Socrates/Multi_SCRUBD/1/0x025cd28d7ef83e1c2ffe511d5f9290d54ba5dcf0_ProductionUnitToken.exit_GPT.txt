Function Security Analysis for ProductionUnitToken.exit()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function exit.
    Check direct function security
        - function ProductionUnitToken.exit() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The provided function does not include any requirement or condition related to checking if `msg.sender` is an 'Owner', 'Address', 'Leader', or 'CEO'.
        - function ProductionUnitToken.exit() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not satisfy any of the stated structures. There is no 'require' statement nor a conditional check followed by a throw or any assignment to
          a boolean variable as described.

Start analyze function: ProductionUnitToken.withdraw()
Function Security Analysis for ProductionUnitToken.withdraw()
    The modifier of function withdraw are ['onlyStronghands']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier onlyStronghands has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The code in the modifier 'onlyStronghands' does not explicitly contain any of the characteristics mentioned: checking ownership/specific addresses or
          lock mechanism. It checks if 'myDividends(true) > 0', which does not satisfy any provided rules.
    Check direct function security
        - function ProductionUnitToken.withdraw() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function uses a modifier 'onlyStronghands' and does not include the structures required to answer 'Yes'.
        - function ProductionUnitToken.withdraw() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code structure does not include any of the specific patterns listed. It does not contain statements like "require(xxx == True); xxx =
          False;" or "if(!xxx) throw; xxx = true;" where a variable is set based on a condition and then reassigned. The code mainly consists of operations on dividends
          and customer address without meeting the specified patterns.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['_customerAddress.transfer(_dividends)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - _customerAddress.transfer(_dividends) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the
        '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: ProductionUnitToken.sell(uint256)
Function Security Analysis for ProductionUnitToken.sell(uint256)
    The modifier of function sell are ['onlyBagholders']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier onlyBagholders has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier checks if the caller has tokens by using `require(myTokens() > 0);`. There is no enforcement based on ownership or specific addresses (Rule
          1), nor a lock operation (Rule 2). The name of the modifier, `onlyBagholders`, does not suggest ownership or non-reentrancy (Rule 3).
    Check direct function security
        - function ProductionUnitToken.sell(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any control structures checking for equality or inequality with msg.sender and specific ownership-related roles such as
          xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, CEO.
        - function ProductionUnitToken.sell(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not include any of the specified structures. It uses 'require' but not with a boolean variable assignment as per the patterns
          mentioned.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['moonIncContract.handleProductionDecrease.value(_dividends)(_customerAddress,_tokens*cookieProductionMultiplier)']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - moonIncContract.handleProductionDecrease.value(_dividends)(_customerAddress,_tokens*cookieProductionMultiplier) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['moonIncContract.handleProductionDecrease.value(_dividends)(_customerAddress,_tokens*cookieProductionMultiplier)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['moonIncContract'] should be checked in variable moonIncContract
        Checked variables: moonIncContract
            Yes The provided function is named 'ProductionUnitToken', which matches the contract name 'ProductionUnitToken', hence it is the constructor of the contract.
            Constructors satisfy the first characteristic since they initialize the contract.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
