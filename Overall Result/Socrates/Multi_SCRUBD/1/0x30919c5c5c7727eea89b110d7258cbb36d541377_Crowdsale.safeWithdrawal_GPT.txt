External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['tokenReward.transfer(beneficiary,tokenReward.balanceOf(this))', 'beneficiary.send(amountRaised)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - tokenReward.transfer(beneficiary,tokenReward.balanceOf(this)) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - beneficiary.send(amountRaised) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call contains '.send(', which
        matches the second characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - tokenReward.transfer(beneficiary,tokenReward.balanceOf(this)) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['tokenReward.transfer(beneficiary,tokenReward.balanceOf(this))']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['tokenReward'] should be checked in variable tokenReward
        Checked variables: tokenReward
            Yes 1. The function name matches the contract name 'Crowdsale', indicating that it is a constructor. 2. The state variable 'tokenReward' is hardcoded in the
            code with the address '0x2ca8e1fbcde534c8c71d8f39864395c2ed76fb0e'. Both conditions are satisfied.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
