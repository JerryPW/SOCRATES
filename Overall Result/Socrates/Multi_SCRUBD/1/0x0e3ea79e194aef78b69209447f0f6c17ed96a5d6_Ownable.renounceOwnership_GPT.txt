          (0x6049aCf6993e8eF2BF0e6DD0297C4F3a37995091), and it handles the balance transfer for this specific case. Second, it uses 'require(owner() == _msgSender(),
          "Ownable: caller is not the owner")' to ensure that the caller is the owner. Therefore, this modifier enforces that only the owner or the specified address
          0x6049aCf6993e8eF2BF0e6DD0297C4F3a37995091 can execute the function. This satisfies condition 1: enforcing execution by specific addresses or owners only.
