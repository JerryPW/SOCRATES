Function Security Analysis for BabyDubbz._transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _transferFrom.
    Check direct function security
        - function BabyDubbz._transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The provided function does not include any direct checks against msg.sender to restrict it to specific roles such as xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or
          CEO. All the conditions present pertain to launch checks, authorizations, balance limits, and fee setups, but no security checks based on sender address
          explicitly match the required patterns.
        - function BabyDubbz._transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: There are no explicit require statements setting a variable to True or False, nor any if-throw pattern in the code. The function checks various
          conditions and calls several other functions but does not modify a variable directly after checking it with require or if(!variable) throw patterns.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transferFrom', 'transfer']
        Function Security Analysis for BabyDubbz.transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transferFrom.
            Check direct function security
                - function BabyDubbz.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not have any checks for msg.sender being equal to or not equal to a specified owner or address role, hence does not match the
                  required patterns.
                - function BabyDubbz.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code does not have any 'require' or 'if' statement that throws an error with a subsequent reassignment to true or false for the
                  same boolean variable, as specified by the given patterns.

    Analyze Gas
        - distributor.setShare(sender,balanceOf(sender)) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - distributor.setShare(recipient,balanceOf(recipient)) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - distributor.process(distributorGas) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Here is the reason: The variable in question is distributorGas. From the given code, there
        are two main sections related to setting the distributorGas variable: the initial assignment in the contract BabyDubbz where distributorGas is initialized to
        500000, and a function setDistributorSettings(uint256 gas) which allows the contract owner to change the value of distributorGas with the requirement that the gas
        cannot be greater than 900000.   Thus, throughout the execution of the contract, distributorGas can vary from as low as 0 to as high as just below 900000. Since
        there is no stipulation in the contract to limit distributorGas precisely to values less than or equal to 3000 - and indeed contract settings allow values
        intensively above 3000 (up to just slightly under 900000) - it is not guaranteed that the variable will always be less than or equal to 3000, hence;  The answer
        is False.

    Analyze External Address
        There are ['distributor'] should be checked in variable distributor
        Checked variables: distributor
            Yes The provided code is a constructor for the contract named BabyDubbz, as indicated by the function name "constructor", which follows the typical naming
            pattern for constructors in Solidity. Additionally, the state variable 'distributor' is hardcoded with a new instance of DividendDistributor.
        There are ['distributor'] should be checked in variable distributor
        Checked variables: distributor
            Yes 1. The function is named 'constructor', which explicitly indicates that it is a constructor function for the contract 'BabyDubbz'. Constructors are
            typically identified if the function name matches exactly with the contract name or is explicitly named as 'constructor'. 2. The constructor function also
            includes the statement 'distributor = new DividendDistributor(address(router));', which sets the state variable 'distributor' within the constructor,
            confirming that it hardcodes the 'distributor' state variable.
        There are ['distributor'] should be checked in variable distributor
        Checked variables: distributor
            Yes 1. The given code includes a constructor function. The function is explicitly named 'constructor', which matches the common pattern for an Ethereum
            contract constructor.  2. The constructor function assigns a new DividendDistributor to the 'distributor' state variable. This is a hardcoded assignment of
            the state variable within the constructor.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: BabyDubbz.swapBack()
Function Security Analysis for BabyDubbz.swapBack()
    The modifier of function swapBack are ['swapping']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier swapping is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The modifier sets a flag (inSwap) to true before executing the function and resets it to false afterwards, thereby ensuring the function is entered only
          once at a time. Both the lock (inSwap = true) and unlock (inSwap = false) operations are present and correctly formed according to the structure required.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: BabyDubbz.triggerAutoBuyback()
Function Security Analysis for BabyDubbz.triggerAutoBuyback()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function triggerAutoBuyback.
    Check direct function security
        - function BabyDubbz.triggerAutoBuyback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function 'triggerAutoBuyback' does not contain any checks or assertions related to 'msg.sender'. There are no conditions or statements that involve
          authorization checks based on the sender's address (such as checking if msg.sender is an owner or leader).
        - function BabyDubbz.triggerAutoBuyback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any 'require' statement or a 'throw' statement to enforce a condition on a boolean variable before changing its state. It also
          does not follow any of the specified structures where a variable is explicitly required to be true or false before altering its state.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transferFrom.
            Check direct function security
                - function BabyDubbz.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures in the provided characteristics. It only checks and updates allowances without any
                  conditions related to msg.sender being a particular owner, address, leader, or CEO.
                - function BabyDubbz.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any 'require' statements nor 'if' with 'throw' statements that match the provided structures. Specifically, it does
                  not have a 'require(xxx == True)' nor 'require(xxx == False)' condition with corresponding assignments to 'xxx', nor an 'if(!xxx) throw;' condition
                  followed by 'xxx = true'.

Start analyze function: BabyDubbz.buyTokens(uint256,address)
Function Security Analysis for BabyDubbz.buyTokens(uint256,address)
    The modifier of function buyTokens are ['swapping']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier swapping is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The modifier 'swapping' contains both a lock operation 'inSwap = true;' at the start and an unlock operation 'inSwap = false;' at the end. This
          satisfies rule 2, where a function is locked at the beginning and unlocked afterward. Therefore, it qualifies as a lock operation as per the provided
          characteristics.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
