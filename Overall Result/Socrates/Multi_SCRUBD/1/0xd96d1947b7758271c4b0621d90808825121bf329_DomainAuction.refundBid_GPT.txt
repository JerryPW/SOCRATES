External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['bid.bidder.send(bid.amount)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - bid.bidder.send(bid.amount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the '.send('
        keyword, which satisfies condition 2.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
