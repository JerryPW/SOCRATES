Function Security Analysis for SEISHI.transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function transferFrom.
    Check direct function security
        - function SEISHI.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not include any checks or assertions that match the specified structures involving 'msg.sender' and owner/leader/CEO variables.
        - function SEISHI.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not have any of the specified structures, such as checking a boolean with `require` or `if` and changing its value from True to False or
          vice versa.

Start analyze function: SEISHI._transfer(address,address,uint256)
Function Security Analysis for SEISHI._transfer(address,address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _transfer.
    Check direct function security
        - function SEISHI._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The given code does not contain any statements with the specified structures related to checking msg.sender. It involves checks on addresses and
          balances, but none of those checks validates msg.sender against specific ownership or authority roles as described in the given characteristics.
        - function SEISHI._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function '_transfer' does not contain any of the specified patterns in the prompt, such as changing the state of a boolean variable immediately
          after a require statement or using a require statement with a negated boolean check in the specified manner.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transferFrom', 'transfer']
        Function Security Analysis for SEISHI.transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transferFrom.
            Check direct function security
                - function SEISHI.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any condition that checks if msg.sender is an owner or specific address.
                - function SEISHI.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not use any boolean variables with the structures required for this task. It has a require statement but does not follow up with
                  setting a boolean variable to True or False as needed in the specified structures.

    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: SEISHI.swapForTokenomics(uint256)
Function Security Analysis for SEISHI.swapForTokenomics(uint256)
    The modifier of function swapForTokenomics are ['lockTheSwap']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier lockTheSwap is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The modifier 'lockTheSwap' meets the requirement of rule 2, as it clearly sets the 'inSwapAndLiquify' flag to true at the beginning and resets it to
          false at the end, ensuring that the function is protected by a lock operation for one-time execution.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
