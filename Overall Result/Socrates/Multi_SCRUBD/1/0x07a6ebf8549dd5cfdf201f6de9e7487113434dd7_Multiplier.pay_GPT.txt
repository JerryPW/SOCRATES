Function Security Analysis for Multiplier.pay()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function pay.
    Check direct function security
        - function Multiplier.pay() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not have any access control checks related to msg.sender, such as require or if statements restricting access to a specific owner,
          address, leader, or CEO.
        - function Multiplier.pay() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code uses a for loop with some constraints but doesn't use any form of 'require' or 'if' structure as specified to meet the required
          characteristics.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['fallback']
        Function Security Analysis for Multiplier.fallback()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
            Check direct function security
                - function Multiplier.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain any explicit check or condition that compares msg.sender with an Owner, Address, Leader, or CEO structure as specified
                  in the criteria. There is no require, if, or assert statement that involves msg.sender related to ownership or specific addresses beyond checking for
                  contract conditions.
                - function Multiplier.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: Upon reviewing the code, I found the statement `require(!isContract(msg.sender));` but there is no subsequent statement changing the value of
                  `isContract(msg.sender)` to `True` or similar. Hence, the complete structure for the judged criteria is not present as both statements are required to
                  match the structure. Only one part of the structure was found.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['dep.depositor.send(money)', 'dep.depositor.send(dep.expect)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - dep.depositor.send(money) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains '.send('
        keyword, therefore it satisfies the condition.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - dep.depositor.send(dep.expect) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains '.send('
        keyword, therefore it satisfies the condition.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
