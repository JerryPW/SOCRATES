Function Security Analysis for Moloch.unwrapShares(uint256)
    The modifier of function unwrapShares are ['nonReentrant']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier nonReentrant is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The provided code defines a modifier named nonReentrant, which explicitly checks a status flag (_status != _ENTERED) and sets _status to _ENTERED. Then,
          after executing the function code with _;, it resets _status to _NOT_ENTERED. This full cycle (lock and unlock) demonstrates the use of a lock mechanism to
          prevent reentrancy.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
