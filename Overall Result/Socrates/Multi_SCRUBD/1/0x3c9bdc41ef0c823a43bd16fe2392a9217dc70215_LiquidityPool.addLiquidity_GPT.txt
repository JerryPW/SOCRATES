Function Security Analysis for LiquidityPool.addLiquidity(uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function addLiquidity.
    Check direct function security
        - function LiquidityPool.addLiquidity(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not include any access control mechanism involving 'msg.sender'. There are no 'require', 'if', or 'assert' statements checking against any
          ownership or leadership variables.
        - function LiquidityPool.addLiquidity(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code contains a statement `thisStaker.hasMigrated = true;`, however there is no preceding `require(thisStaker.hasMigrated == False);` or similar
          statements to match any of the specified structures. Therefore, none of the specified structures are satisfied in the given function.

    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - pampToken.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),_numTokensToInvest) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - uniswapV2.addLiquidityETH{value:msg.value}(address(pampToken),_numTokensToInvest,0,0,address(this),now+86400) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['pampToken.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),_numTokensToInvest)',
    'uniswapV2.addLiquidityETH{value:msg.value}(address(pampToken),_numTokensToInvest,0,0,address(this),now+86400)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['pampToken'] should be checked in variable pampToken
        Checked variables: pampToken
            Yes 1. The provided code includes a constructor function, as indicated by the 'constructor' keyword. The constructor sets several initial values for state
            variables, including 'pampToken'.  2. The state variable 'pampToken' is hardcoded in the constructor with the address
            '0xF0FAC7104aAC544e4a7CE1A55ADF2B5a25c65bD1'. Hence, it satisfies the requirement of hardcoded state variable within the constructor.  Since at least one of
            the characteristics is satisfied (the code is a constructor, and the state variable 'pampToken' is hardcoded), the answer is 'Yes'.
        There are ['uniswapV2'] should be checked in variable uniswapV2
        Checked variables: uniswapV2
            Yes The provided constructor modifies the uniswapV2 state variable by assigning it a hardcoded address (0x7a250d5630B4cF539739dF2C5dAcb4c659F2488D). This
            satisfies the condition of the function having hardcoded the provided state variable.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
