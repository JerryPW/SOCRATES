          Reason: The modifier is named 'nonReentrant', which suggests it is intended to prevent reentrancy. Analyzing the code, it checks the state with 'require(_status
          != _ENTERED, "ReentrancyGuard: reentrant call")' ensuring the function is not already entered. Then, it sets '_status = _ENTERED;' before executing the function
          body, indicating lock operation. Finally, it resets '_status = _NOT_ENTERED;' after execution, which is the unlock operation. Both lock and unlock behaviors are
          implemented, matching rule 2 completely.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
