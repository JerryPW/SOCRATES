Function Security Analysis for FarmMain._removeLiquidity(uint256,uint256,bool,uint256,bool)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _removeLiquidity.
    Check direct function security
        - function FarmMain._removeLiquidity(uint256,uint256,bool,uint256,bool) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any checks or assertions related to `msg.sender` being equal to or not equal to a specified owner or address like xxxOwner,
          xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO as specified in the criteria.
        - function FarmMain._removeLiquidity(uint256,uint256,bool,uint256,bool) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not have any of the required structures specified in the conditions. There is no use of 'require' to check a condition followed
          by changing the state of a variable as described. Similarly, there is no 'if' statement throwing an error followed by a variable state change as described in
          the conditions.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['unlock', 'withdrawLiquidity']
        Function Security Analysis for FarmMain.unlock(uint256,bool)
            The modifier of function unlock are ['byPositionOwner']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier byPositionOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The modifier 'byPositionOwner' includes a `require` statement that checks if 'msg.sender' is equal to '_positions[positionId].uniqueOwner',
                  directly enforcing owner-only execution. This matches the first rule regarding owner checks. There are no lock operations present that suggest matching
                  structure 2.
        Function Security Analysis for FarmMain.withdrawLiquidity(uint256,uint256,bool,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function withdrawLiquidity.
            Check direct function security
                - function FarmMain.withdrawLiquidity(uint256,uint256,bool,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The check uses 'farmingPosition.uniqueOwner == msg.sender', where 'uniqueOwner' is a property of the 'farmingPosition' local variable, and does
                  not check against a broader variable like 'xxxOwner' directly from the contract context. This does not adhere strictly to the specified structures.
                - function FarmMain.withdrawLiquidity(uint256,uint256,bool,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the required structures as outlined. Specifically, the conditions involving require statements do not match any
                  of the described patterns involving setting a variable to True or False.

        There are ['_setupsInfo'] should be checked in variable setupInfo
        Checked variables: _setupsInfo
            No The provided functions '_setOrAddFarmingSetupInfo' and '_toggleSetup' do not meet any of the conditions specified for a 'Yes' output. Firstly, neither of
            these functions are constructors. A constructor would either have the same name as the contract 'FarmMain' or be explicitly named 'constructor', and these
            functions do not meet that criterion. Secondly, neither function seems to initialize or set a state variable called '_setupsInfo' with a hardcoded value. The
            usage of '_setupsInfo' in the code suggests it is being used dynamically, with no indication of hardcoded values assigned to it.
            Function Security Analysis for FarmMain._setOrAddFarmingSetupInfo(FarmingSetupInfo,bool,bool,uint256)
                There are no modifiers should be examined in function _setOrAddFarmingSetupInfo.
                Check direct function security
                    - function FarmMain._setOrAddFarmingSetupInfo(FarmingSetupInfo,bool,bool,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of
                    msg.sender
                      Reason: The code does not contain any checks verifying the identity of the caller against specific roles like Owner, Address, Leader, or CEO.
                    - function FarmMain._setOrAddFarmingSetupInfo(FarmingSetupInfo,bool,bool,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                      Reason: Upon reevaluation, the previous assessment was incorrect. In the given code, there are require statements but there are no matching sets of
                      require and assignment statements satisfying the specified structure 1, 2, 3, or 4. For example, one of the require statements is
                      'require(setup.active, "Not possible");' but there is no subsequent statement setting setup.active to false as required by the structures.
                Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
                The reachable functions are ['init', 'setFarmingSetups']
                    Function Security Analysis for FarmMain.init(address,bytes,address,address,bytes)
                        There are no modifiers should be examined in function init.
                        Check direct function security
                            - function FarmMain.init(address,bytes,address,address,bytes) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                              Reason: The function does not include require, if, or assert statements checking msg.sender against an owner or specific address role such
                              as xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO.
                            - function FarmMain.init(address,bytes,address,address,bytes) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                              Reason: The code snippet does not contain any structures matching the specified patterns. It has 'require' statements but does not modify
                              the same variables following a 'require'.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
