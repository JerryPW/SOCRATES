Function Security Analysis for ESmart.pay()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function pay.
    Check direct function security
        - function ESmart.pay() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any checks regarding 'msg.sender' corresponding to a specific address or role (Owner/Leader/CEO).
        - function ESmart.pay() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not include any 'require' checks or 'if' checks that match the specified patterns for manipulating boolean variables ('xxx ==
          True', 'xxx == False', '!xxx'). Therefore, none of the structures specified in the criteria (1 to 4) are present in the code.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['fallback']
        Function Security Analysis for ESmart.fallback()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
            Check direct function security
                - function ESmart.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not check or depend on msg.sender being a specific owner, address, leader, or CEO to execute its functionality. The only checks
                  concerning msg.sender are to add deposits or withdraw prizes, independent of any owner or address authorization.
                - function ESmart.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain a require statement that negates a variable's value followed by an assignment to that variable with a different value
                  later on. Therefore, it does not fit any of the defined structures.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['dep.depositor.send(dep.expect)', 'dep.depositor.send(money)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - dep.depositor.send(dep.expect) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the
        '.send(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - dep.depositor.send(money) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the '.send('
        keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
