Function Security Analysis for BATMO.endRound(BATMODatasets.EventReturns)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function endRound.
    Check direct function security
        - function BATMO.endRound(BATMODatasets.EventReturns) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any checks to verify whether the function caller (msg.sender) is an owner or specific address. It entirely lacks any
          structures like require(msg.sender == xxxOwner) or if (msg.sender != xxxOwner) throw, which are typically used to control access based on the sender's address.
        - function BATMO.endRound(BATMODatasets.EventReturns) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function endRound does not contain any of the specified structures. There are no 'require' or 'if' statements related to a variable being checked
          for true or false and then subsequently setting that variable to its opposite value.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['buyCore', 'reLoadXname', 'buyXid', 'reLoadCore', 'fallback', 'reLoadXaddr', 'buyXaddr', 'withdraw', 'buyXname', 'reLoadXid']

            There are no modifiers should be examined in function buyCore.
            Check direct function security
                - function BATMO.buyCore(uint256,uint256,BATMODatasets.EventReturns) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not include any require, if, or assert statements that check whether msg.sender is equal to xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
                - function BATMO.buyCore(uint256,uint256,BATMODatasets.EventReturns) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not satisfy any of the defined structures. There are no statements like 'require(xxx == True); xxx = False;' or 'require(xxx ==
                  False); xxx = True;' or similar constructs in the provided code segment.
            Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
            The reachable functions are ['buyXname', 'buyXid', 'buyXaddr', 'fallback']
                Function Security Analysis for BATMO.buyXname(bytes32)
                    The modifier of function buyXname are ['isActivated', 'isHuman', 'isWithinLimits']
                    The result of checking modifiers:
                        - modifier isActivated has no relation with controlled by owner.
                          Reason: The modifier checks if 'activated_' is true, but this does not enforce owner-only execution or a single-entry lock, nor is there an
                          indication like 'Onlyxxx' or 'nonReentrant' in its naming.
                        - modifier isHuman has no relation with controlled by owner.
                          Reason: The modifier isHuman does not show any ownership or lock pattern. It only checks if the caller is a regular user account (EOA) and not a
                          contract by verifying msg.sender == tx.origin and that code size is zero.
                        - modifier isWithinLimits has no relation with controlled by owner.
                          Reason: The modifier 'isWithinLimits' checks if the '_eth' value is within a specific range using 'require' statements. It does not enforce that
                          only the owner or specific addresses can execute the function, nor does it have lock operations like a reentrancy guard. Therefore, it does not
                          satisfy any of the characteristics mentioned.
                    Check direct function security
                        - function BATMO.buyXname(bytes32) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                          Reason: The code does not contain any of the explicit access control structures that were specified as a requirement. There are no `require`,
                          `if`, or `assert` statements directly checking if `msg.sender` is associated with specific roles or addresses like
                          xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
                        - function BATMO.buyXname(bytes32) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                          Reason: The function 'buyXname' does not contain any of the specified structural patterns involving a require statement or throw with a specific
                          variable being toggled between True and False.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['admin2.transfer(_dev/2)', 'address(ObokContract).call.value(_OBOK.sub((_OBOK/3).mul(2)))(bytes4(keccak256()(donateDivs())))',
    'admin.transfer(_dev/2)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - admin2.transfer(_dev/2) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call 'admin2.transfer(_dev/2)' contains
        the '.transfer(' keyword, satisfying the first condition.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - admin.transfer(_dev/2) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call 'admin.transfer(_dev/2)' contains
        the '.transfer(' keyword, satisfying the first condition.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - address(ObokContract).call.value(_OBOK.sub((_OBOK/3).mul(2)))(bytes4(keccak256()(donateDivs()))) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['address(ObokContract).call.value(_OBOK.sub((_OBOK/3).mul(2)))(bytes4(keccak256()(donateDivs())))']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['ObokContract'] should be checked in variable ObokContract
        Checked variables: ObokContract
            Yes The provided function code is a constructor because its name matches the contract name 'BATMO'.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
