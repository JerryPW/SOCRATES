Function Security Analysis for BrokerV2.collect(uint256,address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function collect.
    Check direct function security
        - function BrokerV2.collect(uint256,address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any checks or require statements that compare the msg.sender with an owner or specific address role like Owner, Address,
          Leader, or CEO.
        - function BrokerV2.collect(uint256,address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not match any of the specified structures. There is no usage of require with a boolean condition where the variable is
          subsequently changed to the opposite boolean value, as outlined in the criteria. The require statements in the code do not follow up with setting the related
          variable to a converse boolean value, either directly or using the '!xxx' syntax, nor does it use 'if(!xxx) throw' syntax followed by setting the variable to
          true.

    Analyze Transfer
        - erc20Token.transfer(lastOwner2,lastOwner_funds) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - lastOwner2.transfer(lastOwner_funds) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the
        '.transfer(' keyword, as seen in 'lastOwner2.transfer(lastOwner_funds)'.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - erc20Token.transfer(creator,royality) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - creator.transfer(royality) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the
        '.transfer(' keyword, as seen in 'creator.transfer(royality)'.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - erc20Token.transfer(lastOwner2,lastOwner_funds) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - erc20Token.transfer(creator,royality) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - Token.safeTransferFrom(Token.ownerOf(tokenID),_auction.highestBidder,tokenID) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['erc20Token.transfer(lastOwner2,lastOwner_funds)', 'erc20Token.transfer(creator,royality)',
    'Token.safeTransferFrom(Token.ownerOf(tokenID),_auction.highestBidder,tokenID)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['auctions'] should be checked in variable erc20Token
        Checked variables: auctions
            No The provided code consists of several functions from a smart contract named BrokerV2. None of these functions is a constructor, as there is no function
            that matches the contract name nor is any function explicitly named 'constructor'. Additionally, the characteristic of having hardcoded the provided state
            variable 'auctions' is not satisfied because 'auctions' is used with dynamic data and not hardcoded values.
            Function Security Analysis for BrokerV2.bid(uint256,address,uint256)
                The modifier of function bid are ['onSaleOnly', 'activeAuction']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onSaleOnly has no relation with controlled by owner.
                      Reason: The modifier does not explicitly enforce execution by an owner or specific address, nor does it show a lock mechanism to prevent reentry. It
                      only checks if a token is open for sale.
                    - modifier activeAuction has no relation with controlled by owner.
                      Reason: The modifier 'activeAuction' doesn't enforce ownership or specific address execution nor does it use a lock mechanism. Its name and logic
                      suggest it's related to a time condition, not access control or reentrancy protection.
                Check direct function security
                    - function BrokerV2.bid(uint256,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                      Reason: The provided code snippet does not contain any of the specific structures outlined in the instructions that involve checks or assertions on
                      the `msg.sender` being equal or not equal to any xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
                    - function BrokerV2.bid(uint256,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                      Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures where a variable xxx is checked with require or if statement, altered to its
                      opposing boolean value, and optionally changed back.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
