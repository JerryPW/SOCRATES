    There are no modifiers should be examined in function internalTransfer.
    Check direct function security
        - function Bozu.internalTransfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not include any condition that directly matches the characteristics listed: there's no use of 'require', 'if', or 'assert'
          specifically asserting or throwing an error based on 'msg.sender' being an owner, leader, CEO, or specific address as the characteristic requires.
        - function Bozu.internalTransfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function contains the structure `require(!isBot[from], "ERC20: Can not transfer from BOT");` and the variable `isBot[from]` is not set to `True`
          thereafter in this function. This partially matches structure 3 `{require(!xxx); xxx = True; ... xxx = False;}` but without setting the variable to True, the
          structure is incomplete as per the provided criteria.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transfer', 'transferFrom', 'withdrawStuckTokens', 'manualBurnTokensFromLP', 'AirDrop']

            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transfer.
            Check direct function security
                - function Bozu.transfer(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The given function does not contain any of the specified structures related to checking the identity of the transaction sender against an owner,
                  address, leader, or CEO. It mainly focuses on transferring and returning a boolean outcome without performing sender verification.
                - function Bozu.transfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code doesn't meet any of the specified structures; there are no require statements or if conditions related to a boolean variable being
                  checked and then modified. It only defines a function for transferring tokens and returns true, which doesn't align with the required patterns.

Start analyze function: Bozu.taxTokenSwap()
Function Security Analysis for Bozu.taxTokenSwap()
    The modifier of function taxTokenSwap are ['lockTheSwap']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier lockTheSwap is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: Upon re-evaluation, the modifier 'lockTheSwap' includes setting 'inSwapAndLiquify' to true before execution and resetting it to false afterward. This
          complete structure matches the lock operation requirement which ensures the function enters only once and is characteristic 2.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
