Function Security Analysis for MonkeyScam.endRound(LDdatasets.EventReturns)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function endRound.
    Check direct function security
        - function MonkeyScam.endRound(LDdatasets.EventReturns) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function doesn't have any condition or assertion related to msg.sender matching specific roles like xxxOwner or Leader.
        - function MonkeyScam.endRound(LDdatasets.EventReturns) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not use the 'require' keyword and lacks conditions or variables that match any of the specified structures.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['buyCore', 'withdraw', 'reLoadXname', 'reLoadXid', 'buyXid', 'reLoadXaddr', 'reLoadCore', 'buyXname', 'buyXaddr', 'fallback']
        Function Security Analysis for MonkeyScam.buyCore(uint256,uint256,LDdatasets.EventReturns)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function buyCore.

                - function MonkeyScam.buyCore(uint256,uint256,LDdatasets.EventReturns) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures related to msg.sender checking against owner or similar roles.
                - function MonkeyScam.buyCore(uint256,uint256,LDdatasets.EventReturns) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: Upon revisiting the code, the structure `require(xxx == False); xxx = True;` or equivalent variants in JavaScript format is not fully present.
                  The initial judgment was based on the presence of `if (_now > round_.end && round_.ended == false)` followed by `round_.ended = true;`. However, this
                  does not strictly conform to the given structures as it lacks a `throw` or `require` statement before setting `round_.ended = true;`. Thus, the criteria
                  for a structural match have not been fully met.
            Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
            The reachable functions are ['fallback', 'buyXid', 'buyXaddr', 'buyXname']
                Function Security Analysis for MonkeyScam.fallback()
                    The modifier of function fallback are ['isActivated', 'isHuman', 'isWithinLimits']
                    The result of checking modifiers:
                        - modifier isActivated has no relation with controlled by owner.
                          Reason: The modifier does not enforce owner-only access, nor does it use a lock operation. It only checks if a variable 'activated_' is true,
                          which does not fall under any of the specified characteristics.
                        - modifier isHuman has no relation with controlled by owner.
                          Reason: The modifier isHuman() checks if the sender's address has a code length of zero, implying it is not a smart contract. This does not
                          directly enforce ownership checks or owner-specific execution. Neither does it use a lock mechanism. Therefore, none of the rules apply in this
                          case.
                        - modifier isWithinLimits has no relation with controlled by owner.
                          Reason: The modifier checks if the input value `_eth` is within the specified limits but does not enforce ownership or specific address
                          requirements, nor does it implement any lock operations. Therefore, it does not satisfy any of the rules required for a 'Yes' answer.

                        - function MonkeyScam.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                          Reason: The given code does not contain any of the specified structures related to msg.sender verification.
                        - function MonkeyScam.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                          Reason: The provided code does not exhibit any of the specified structures that include either require(xxx == True) or require(xxx == False)
                          followed by setting the same variable to its opposite value.
