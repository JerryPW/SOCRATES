Function Security Analysis for charge.claimFarmedToken(address,address,uint8)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function claimFarmedToken.
    Check direct function security
        - function charge.claimFarmedToken(address,address,uint8) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures that explicitly check for `msg.sender` equality or inequality with an owner-like
          variable.
        - function charge.claimFarmedToken(address,address,uint8) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does satisfy Structure 3 with {require(!_isWithdrawing); _isWithdrawing = true;}, where '_isWithdrawing' is checked and then set. However, the
          main logic of the function isn't executed immediately after setting '_isWithdrawing = true;'. Instead, there is an extensive processing block that follows,
          including setting the 'amount', before the logic related to the output actions. Performing the state negation isn't immediate or prior to the main logic, which
          means it doesn't follow the specific requirement given.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

        Function Security Analysis for charge.FarmedTokenWithdrawSlotOne(address)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function FarmedTokenWithdrawSlotOne.
            Check direct function security
                - function charge.FarmedTokenWithdrawSlotOne(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not have any checks involving require, if, or assert statements that compare msg.sender to an owner or specific address.
                - function charge.FarmedTokenWithdrawSlotOne(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures involving require statements or condition checks modifying a boolean variable.

        - _UniswapRouter.swapExactETHForTokensSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens{value:amount}(0,path,addr,block.timestamp) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['_UniswapRouter.swapExactETHForTokensSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens{value:amount}(0,path,addr,block.timestamp)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['_UniswapRouter'] should be checked in variable _UniswapRouter
        Checked variables: _UniswapRouter
            Yes The provided code segment is the constructor of the contract. This is indicated by the use of the keyword 'constructor' when defining the function.
            Additionally, the state variable _UniswapRouter is hardcoded within this constructor as it is assigned a value from the initialization function
            IUniswapRouter02(UniswapRouterAddy).
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
