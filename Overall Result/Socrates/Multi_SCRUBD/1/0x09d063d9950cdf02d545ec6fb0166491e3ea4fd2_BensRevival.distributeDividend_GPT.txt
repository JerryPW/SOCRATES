Function Security Analysis for BensRevival.distributeDividend(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function distributeDividend.
    Check direct function security
        - function BensRevival.distributeDividend(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function 'distributeDividend' does not contain any of the specified control or check structures involving 'msg.sender'. It only performs operations
          related to dividend distribution without verifying the sender's identity against any ownership or leadership address.
        - function BensRevival.distributeDividend(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not contain any of the specified structures with 'require' or 'if' related to a boolean condition following the mandated patterns.
          Conditions are checked using 'if' statements, but they don't manipulate a boolean variable according to the required patterns.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['claimTokens', 'setShare', 'process']
        Function Security Analysis for BensRevival.claimTokens(address)
            The modifier of function claimTokens are ['onlyToken']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyToken is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The correct judgment is based on Rule 1. The code uses `require(msg.sender == _token);`, which enforces that only a specific address (_token)
                  can execute the function, matching the criteria of Rule 1. This part of the code corresponds to the required check, thus there are no structural
                  omissions.
        Function Security Analysis for BensRevival.setShare(address,uint256)
            The modifier of function setShare are ['onlyToken']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyToken is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The code snippet within the modifier 'onlyToken' contains the statement 'require(msg.sender == _token);'. This enforces that only a specific
                  address (_token) can execute the function, which matches characteristic 1, checking for ownership or specific address execution constraint.
        Function Security Analysis for BensRevival.process(uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function process.
            Check direct function security
                - function BensRevival.process(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The provided code doesn't contain any checks or assertions involving msg.sender, or any of the patterns specified in the list of
                  characteristics.
                - function BensRevival.process(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not have the required structure of require or if statements with variable reassignments as per any of the provided patterns.

    Remaining external call: ['IERC20(REVIVAL).transfer(shareholder,amount)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['REVIVAL'] should be checked in variable REVIVAL
        Checked variables: REVIVAL
            Yes The provided code includes a constructor function for the 'BensRevival' contract. Although the function does not explicitly use the 'constructor' keyword,
            the function has no name, which implicitly suggests it is a constructor in recent Solidity versions. Additionally, the constructor hardcodes the value for the
            state variable 'REVIVAL'. These satisfy both characteristics mentioned in the problem: it's a constructor and it hardcodes the state variable.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
