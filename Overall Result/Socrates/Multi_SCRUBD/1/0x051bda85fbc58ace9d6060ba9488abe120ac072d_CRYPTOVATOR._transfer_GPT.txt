Function Security Analysis for CRYPTOVATOR._transfer(address,address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _transfer.
    Check direct function security
        - function CRYPTOVATOR._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures related to msg.sender checks against specific roles like xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
        - function CRYPTOVATOR._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon reviewing the code, I identified that none of the required structures are present. The relevant part of the code is 'require(!blackListAdd[from]',
          which is a single instance requiring that `blackListAdd[from]` is false, and there is no corresponding assignment setting `blackListAdd[from]` to true (or any
          other equivalent actions). Therefore, none of the defined structures that require a specific sequence of statements are fully satisfied.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transferFrom', 'transfer']
        Function Security Analysis for CRYPTOVATOR.transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transferFrom.
            Check direct function security
                - function CRYPTOVATOR.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain any require, if, or assert statements checking if msg.sender is equal or not equal to any owner or address related
                  variable.
                - function CRYPTOVATOR.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code does not contain any 'require' statements or conditional checks as specified in the structures. It only executes function
                  calls and arithmetic operations.

Start analyze function: CRYPTOVATOR.swapBack()
Function Security Analysis for CRYPTOVATOR.swapBack()
    The modifier of function swapBack are ['lockTheSwap']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier lockTheSwap is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The modifier 'lockTheSwap' sets 'inSwapAndLiquify' to true before executing the function body and resets it to false afterward, matching both the lock
          and unlock pattern required in rule 2.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
