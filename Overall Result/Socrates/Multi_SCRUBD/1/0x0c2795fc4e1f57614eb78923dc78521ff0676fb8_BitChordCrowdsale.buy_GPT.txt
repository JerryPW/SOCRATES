Function Security Analysis for BitChordCrowdsale.buy(address,uint256,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function buy.
    Check direct function security
        - function BitChordCrowdsale.buy(address,uint256,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function 'buy' does not check the identity of 'msg.sender' by comparing it to any ownership or leader address. Therefore, none of the conditions
          specified are met.
        - function BitChordCrowdsale.buy(address,uint256,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code contains the structure 'if(!phase2Flag) phase2Flag = true;', which matches the pattern 3. However, the main logic code starts executing between
          the check and the assignment: 'stage_2_maxcap = stage_2_maxcap.add(STAGE_1_MAXCAP.sub(stage_1_TokensSold));'  is executed before 'phase2Flag = true;'. This
          means the negation operation is not performed immediately after the state check and instead some logic (stage_2_maxcap calculation) is performed in between.
          Therefore, it does not meet the specific requirement of immediate negation after state check before any main logic execution.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['fallback']
        Function Security Analysis for BitChordCrowdsale.fallback()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
            Check direct function security
                - function BitChordCrowdsale.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any checks relating to msg.sender being equal or not equal to a specific owner or address like xxxOwner,
                  xxxAddress, Leader, CEO, as per the specified characteristics.
                - function BitChordCrowdsale.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code snippet has a `require` statement, but it doesn't follow any of the specific patterns outlined in the characteristics. All the given
                  structures need a boolean variable to be required false/true and then be set to true/false. The snippet is missing the part where the variable is set to
                  true/false after the require statement.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['token.transfer(_address,availableTokens)', 'msg.sender.transfer(_value.sub(ethRequire))',
    'distributionAddress.transfer(address(this).balance.sub(oraclizeBalance))', 'token.transfer(_address,tokensToSend)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - token.transfer(_address,availableTokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - msg.sender.transfer(_value.sub(ethRequire)) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        'msg.sender.transfer(_value.sub(ethRequire))' contains '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - distributionAddress.transfer(address(this).balance.sub(oraclizeBalance)) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the
        reason: The external call 'distributionAddress.transfer(address(this).balance.sub(oraclizeBalance))' contains '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in
        'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - token.transfer(_address,tokensToSend) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - token.transfer(_address,availableTokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - token.transfer(_address,tokensToSend) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['token.transfer(_address,availableTokens)', 'token.transfer(_address,tokensToSend)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            Yes The function 'BitChordCrowdsale' has the same name as the contract 'BitChordCrowdsale', which implies that it is a constructor for the contract. As per
            Solidity pre-0.5.0 convention, constructors are defined by naming the function the same as the contract name.
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            Yes The function 'BitChordCrowdsale' matches the contract name 'BitChordCrowdsale'. According to the first characteristic, if the function name matches the
            contract name, it indicates that the function is a constructor.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
