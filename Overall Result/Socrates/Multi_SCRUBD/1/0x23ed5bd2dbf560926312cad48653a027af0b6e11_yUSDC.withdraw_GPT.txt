Function Security Analysis for yUSDC.withdraw(uint256)
    The modifier of function withdraw are ['nonReentrant', 'noContract']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier nonReentrant is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The modifier indicates use of lock operation due to the increment of '_guardCounter' at the beginning and the reentrancy check at the end with
          'require(localCounter == _guardCounter)', ensuring the function enters only once, thus confirming lock and unlock operations are present. This satisfies rule 2
          and is also inferred from the name 'nonReentrant', which aligns with rule 3.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
