    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _transferFrom.
    Check direct function security
        - function $BITCOINReflections._transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any 'require', 'if', or 'assert' statements with 'msg.sender' related to 'xxxOwner', 'xxxAddress', 'Leader', or 'CEO'.
        - function $BITCOINReflections._transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code provided contains the statement `if(!isTxLimitExempt[recipient])` with a condition check and subsequent require statements, but it doesn't
          follow the specific structural rules outlined for determining a match. There is no clear sequence of changing a boolean variable's value after a conditional
          check like require(xxx == False); xxx = True; or similar structures specified.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transferFrom', 'transfer']

            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transferFrom.
            Check direct function security
                - function $BITCOINReflections.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any check or assertion involving msg.sender and a specific account like Owner or Address directly imposed in the
                  structures provided.
                - function $BITCOINReflections.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the required structures according to the given criteria. Specifically, there's no `require` statement
                  or a conditional check followed by variable assignment that matches any of the specified patterns.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['distributor.setShare(recipient,_balances[recipient])', 'distributor.process(distributorGas)',
    'distributor.setShare(sender,_balances[sender])']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - distributor.setShare(recipient,_balances[recipient]) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - distributor.process(distributorGas) is subjected to gas limits distributorGas <= 3000. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The
        function `setDistributorSettings` in the provided code contains a requirement (`require(gas < 750000);`) that ensures the `distributorGas` variable is assigned a
        value strictly less than 750,000. Therefore, the value of `distributorGas` can never equal or exceed 3000 or be any other value up to 749999, inclusive. Thus, the
        `distributorGas` variable will always remain less than 3000.  Given that the requirement explicitly restricts the maximum value of `distributorGas` to below
        750000, and certainly below 3000, any assignment to this variable as per the function call would be within accepted limits making the assertion that
        `distributorGas <= 3000` always True for any assigned value.
        - distributor.setShare(sender,_balances[sender]) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['distributor.setShare(recipient,_balances[recipient])', 'distributor.setShare(sender,_balances[sender])']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['distributor'] should be checked in variable distributor
        Checked variables: distributor
            Yes 1. The provided code is a constructor because its function explicitly uses the 'constructor' keyword. 2. The state variable 'distributor' is being
            assigned a new instance of 'DividendDistributor' with '_dexRouter' passed as a parameter, not a hardcoded value.
        There are ['distributor'] should be checked in variable distributor
        Checked variables: distributor
            Yes 1. The external call is inside a function named 'constructor', which matches the second part of the first characteristic (explicitly named 'constructor').
            2. The constructor initializes the 'distributor' state variable directly with a new instance of 'DividendDistributor', thereby satisfying the hardcoded state
            variable characteristic.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: $BITCOINReflections.swapBack()
Function Security Analysis for $BITCOINReflections.swapBack()
    The modifier of function swapBack are ['swapping']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier swapping is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The modifier sets 'inSwap' to true before executing the function and resets it to false afterwards, ensuring that the function is locked and unlocked
          properly. This matches the lock operation pattern described in rule 2.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: $BITCOINReflections.triggerAutoBuyback()
Function Security Analysis for $BITCOINReflections.triggerAutoBuyback()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function triggerAutoBuyback.
    Check direct function security
        - function $BITCOINReflections.triggerAutoBuyback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function 'triggerAutoBuyback' does not contain any of the specified structures related to checking msg.sender.
        - function $BITCOINReflections.triggerAutoBuyback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function 'triggerAutoBuyback' does not contain any of the required structures such as checking a condition with 'require' or using an 'if' statement
          followed by a boolean assignment that aligns with the specified patterns.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transferFrom', 'transfer', '_transferFrom']
        Function Security Analysis for $BITCOINReflections.transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transferFrom.
            Check direct function security
                - function $BITCOINReflections.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not include any of the specified structures that check msg.sender against an owner-type or leader-type address.
                - function $BITCOINReflections.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the required structures as listed. There are comparisons and assignments, but none matches the patterns
                  specified, such as 'require(xxx == True)', 'require(xxx == False)', 'require(!xxx)', or 'if(!xxx) throw'.

Start analyze function: $BITCOINReflections.buyTokens(uint256,address)
Function Security Analysis for $BITCOINReflections.buyTokens(uint256,address)
    The modifier of function buyTokens are ['swapping']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier swapping is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The modifier 'swapping' contains both lock and unlock operations: 'inSwap = true;' is executed before the function, and 'inSwap = false;' is executed
          after the function, ensuring the function can only be entered once at a time. Thus, it matches rule 2 completely.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
