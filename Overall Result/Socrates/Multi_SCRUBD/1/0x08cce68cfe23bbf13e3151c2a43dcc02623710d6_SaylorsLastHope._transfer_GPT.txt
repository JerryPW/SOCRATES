    Check direct function security
        - function SaylorsLastHope._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The provided function contains a conditional statement 'if (sender != owner && recipient != owner)' which is similar to the second structure we are
          looking for (if(msg.sender != xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO) {...}). However, it checks a condition not directly related to msg.sender. The function checks
          sender and recipient addresses against the owner, but does not involve a direct restriction/action based on msg.sender compared to owner or another specific
          address role. None of the specified ownership structures directly apply.
        - function SaylorsLastHope._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not have any of the specified structures with regards to require statements or if-throw statements affecting a singular variable followed
          by its modification. It uses different require conditions, but none meets the specific structure criteria outlined.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transferFrom', 'transfer']
        Function Security Analysis for SaylorsLastHope.transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transferFrom.
            Check direct function security
                - function SaylorsLastHope.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function checks `_allowances[sender][msg.sender]` but doesn't include any logic related to `msg.sender` being or not being an owner,
                  address, leader, or CEO.
                - function SaylorsLastHope.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not match any of the specified structures. It neither has a require statement nor a throw inside an if statement. It manipulates
                  allowances but lacks the specific sequence involving a boolean variable that is demanded by the provided structures.

    Analyze External Address
        There are ['moneyPrinter'] should be checked in variable moneyPrinter
        Checked variables: moneyPrinter
            Yes The provided code snippet contains a constructor for the contract. The function is explicitly named 'constructor', which matches the rule stating that
            constructors can either share the same name as the contract or be explicitly named 'constructor'.
        There are ['moneyPrinter'] should be checked in variable moneyPrinter
        Checked variables: moneyPrinter
            Yes The code provided is a constructor because it is explicitly named 'constructor'. Constructors are special functions in Solidity that are executed once
            during the deployment of a contract and are used to initialize state variables and set initial conditions. The constructor in the given code does not mention
            or hardcode the "moneyPrinter" state variable directly within its lines, but it does initialize a new instance of the MoneyPrinter contract with 'moneyPrinter
            = new MoneyPrinter();'.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: SaylorsLastHope.swapBack()
Function Security Analysis for SaylorsLastHope.swapBack()
    The modifier of function swapBack are ['lockTheSwap']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier lockTheSwap is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The modifier 'lockTheSwap' consistently sets the boolean flag 'inSwapAndLiquify' to true before executing the function and resets it to false
          afterwards. This operation ensures that the function executes only once at a time, matching both the lock (set true) and unlock (reset false) criteria stated in
          structure 2.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
