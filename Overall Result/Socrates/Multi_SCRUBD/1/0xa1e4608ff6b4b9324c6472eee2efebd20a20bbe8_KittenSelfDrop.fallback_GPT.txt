Function Security Analysis for KittenSelfDrop.fallback()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
    Check direct function security
        - function KittenSelfDrop.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code checks conditions related to participants and tokens but does not have any checks or assertions specifically involving msg.sender being a
          specific owner, address, or role such as Owner, Leader, CEO, etc.
        - function KittenSelfDrop.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the defined structures with require statements relating to a boolean assignment post-require, or if statement that
          throws with a boolean assignment. The requirements are dependent on conditions, but none follow the specified structures for analysis.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['kittenContract.balanceOf(msg.sender)', 'kittenContract.transfer(msg.sender,tokensIssued)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - kittenContract.transfer(msg.sender,tokensIssued) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - kittenContract.balanceOf(msg.sender) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - kittenContract.transfer(msg.sender,tokensIssued) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['kittenContract.balanceOf(msg.sender)', 'kittenContract.transfer(msg.sender,tokensIssued)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['kittenContract'] should be checked in variable kittenContract
        Checked variables: kittenContract
            Yes 1. The function `KittenSelfDrop` in the code matches the name of the contract, which suggests that it is a constructor function for the contract. 2. The
            state variable `kittenContract` is assigned the value of `KittenCoin(c)`, where `c` is a hardcoded address set to
            `0xac2BD14654BBf22F9d8f20c7b3a70e376d3436B4`. Therefore, this function also satisfies the second characteristic since it hardcodes the state variable.  Thus,
            the function satisfies both characteristics of being a constructor and having a hardcoded state variable.
        There are ['kittenContract'] should be checked in variable kittenContract
        Checked variables: kittenContract
            Yes The function is named 'KittenSelfDrop', which matches the contract name 'KittenSelfDrop', suggesting that it is likely a constructor function. Therefore,
            the code satisfies the first characteristic.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
