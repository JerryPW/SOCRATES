Function Security Analysis for SafeDif.distributeRef(uint256,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function distributeRef.
    Check direct function security
        - function SafeDif.distributeRef(uint256,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified patterns such as condition checks for msg.sender regarding specific user roles like
          xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
        - function SafeDif.distributeRef(uint256,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures. It involves conditions and arithmetic operations, but none of the particular patterns with
          'require' or 'throw' structures as described.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['invest', 'fallback']
        Function Security Analysis for SafeDif.invest(uint256,uint256)
            The modifier of function invest are ['isActivated']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier isActivated has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier `isActivated` checks if the variable `activated_` is true but does not restrict access based on the msg.sender or enforce a lock
                  pattern. It also does not suggest its purpose by its name indicating ownership control or reentrancy protection.
            Check direct function security
                - function SafeDif.invest(uint256,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not include any check where 'require' or 'if' conditions check specifically against 'msg.sender' for an xxx owner or address
                  such as xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, CEO. The only 'require' here checks on '_planId' and 'msg.value'.
                - function SafeDif.invest(uint256,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the required structures: require(xxx == True); xxx = False;, require(xxx == False); xxx = True;, require(!xxx);
                  xxx = True;, or if(!xxx) throw; xxx = true;. Hence, it does not satisfy any of the criteria for outputting 'Yes'.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['player_[_affID1].addr.transfer(_aff)', 'player_[_affID2].addr.transfer(_aff)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - player_[_affID1].addr.transfer(_aff) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the
        '.transfer(' keyword, which satisfies the first characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - player_[_affID2].addr.transfer(_aff) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the
        '.transfer(' keyword, which satisfies the first characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
