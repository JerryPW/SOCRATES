Function Security Analysis for CoolUncle.distributeDividend(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function distributeDividend.
    Check direct function security
        - function CoolUncle.distributeDividend(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any structure matching the specified patterns involving msg.sender checks against owner, address, leader, or CEO.
        - function CoolUncle.distributeDividend(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function contains an if statement to check if an action should be taken but does not include any of the specified logical structures like require
          statements or the specific modifications to a boolean variable.  Specifically, the code lacks any require statements that involve checking a boolean variable
          before altering its value. It only has conditional logic with if clauses without modifying a corresponding boolean variable as required.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['setShare', 'process', 'gibSHIL']
        Function Security Analysis for CoolUncle.setShare(address,uint256)
            The modifier of function setShare are ['onlyToken']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyToken is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The modifier onlyToken enforces that only the address equal to _token can execute the function by using require(msg.sender == _token);. This
                  matches Rule 1 about restricting execution to specific addresses by verifying msg.sender, thus satisfying the condition.
        Function Security Analysis for CoolUncle.process(uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function process.
            Check direct function security
                - function CoolUncle.process(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function `process` does not contain any of the required structures like require, if, or assert with conditions involving `msg.sender` and an
                  owner or leader address.
                - function CoolUncle.process(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the required structures (require(xxx == True), xxx = False or require(xxx == False), xxx = True or
                  require(!xxx), xxx = True or if(!xxx) throw, xxx = true). The code primarily focuses on looping through shareholders and checking/distributing dividends
                  without any require or if-throw statements related to variable toggling between true and false.

    Analyze Gas
        - IERC20(SHIL).transfer(shareholder,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['IERC20(SHIL).transfer(shareholder,amount)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['SHIL'] should be checked in variable SHIL
        Checked variables: SHIL
            Yes The function is explicitly named 'constructor', which establishes it as a constructor function. In this constructor, the state variable 'SHIL' is
            hardcoded to the address '0x20c3fa331A385b63EE39137e99d0cF2db142fCe1'. Since it satisfies one of the given characteristics, the answer is 'Yes'.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
