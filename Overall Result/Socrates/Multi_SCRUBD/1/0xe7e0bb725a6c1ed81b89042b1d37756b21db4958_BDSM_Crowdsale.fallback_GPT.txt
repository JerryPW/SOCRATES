    Analyze Transfer
        - sharesTokenAddress.transfer(msg.sender,tokenFree) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - msg.sender.transfer(msg.value-sendETH) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains
        '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - owner.transfer(actualETHTransfer) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains

    Analyze External Address
        There are ['sharesTokenAddress'] should be checked in variable sharesTokenAddress
        Checked variables: sharesTokenAddress
            Yes The function name 'BDSM_Crowdsale' matches the contract name 'BDSM_Crowdsale', indicating that this function is a constructor. Constructors are called
            only once when the contract is deployed, and their primary purpose is to initialize the contract state. This satisfies the first characteristic for marking
            the function as 'Yes'.
        There are ['sharesTokenAddress'] should be checked in variable sharesTokenAddress
        Checked variables: sharesTokenAddress
            Yes 1. The function name 'BDSM_Crowdsale' matches the contract name 'BDSM_Crowdsale', indicating that it's a constructor. 2. The function does modify the
            state variable 'sharesTokenAddress', but it doesn't hardcode it; instead, it assigns it using the parameter '_tokenAddress'.
        There are ['sharesTokenAddress'] should be checked in variable sharesTokenAddress
        Checked variables: sharesTokenAddress
            Yes The function name 'BDSM_Crowdsale' matches the contract name 'BDSM_Crowdsale', which typically indicates that it is a constructor function in Solidity.
            Constructor functions are those whose names match the contract name and are executed once during the deployment of the contract.
        There are ['sharesTokenAddress'] should be checked in variable sharesTokenAddress
        Checked variables: sharesTokenAddress
            Yes The provided code is a constructor function for the contract 'BDSM_Crowdsale'. The function name matches the contract name, which indicates that it is a
            constructor. Constructor functions are special functions that are called automatically when a contract is created. They are used to set up the initial state
            and are typically used to initialize state variables with arguments passed during contract deployment.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
