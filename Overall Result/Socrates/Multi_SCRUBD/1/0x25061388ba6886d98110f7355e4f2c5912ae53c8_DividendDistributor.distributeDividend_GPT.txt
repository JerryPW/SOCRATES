Function Security Analysis for DividendDistributor.distributeDividend(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function distributeDividend.
    Check direct function security
        - function DividendDistributor.distributeDividend(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not have any checks on msg.sender. It only checks conditions related to the shareholders and their amounts.
        - function DividendDistributor.distributeDividend(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not have any statements that match the provided structures with sequential logical negation and re-assignment of the same boolean
          variable.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['setShare', 'process', 'claimDividend']
        Function Security Analysis for DividendDistributor.setShare(address,uint256)
            The modifier of function setShare are ['onlyToken']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyToken is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The modifier onlyToken contains the statement require(msg.sender == _token), which enforces that only the address stored in _token can execute
                  the function. This satisfies the first characteristic, allowing specific addresses to execute the function.
        Function Security Analysis for DividendDistributor.process(uint256)
            The modifier of function process are ['onlyToken']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyToken is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The modifier contains the statement 'require(msg.sender == _token);', which enforces that only the address stored in '_token' can execute the
                  function. This matches rule 1, as it is checking if the sender is a specific address.
        Function Security Analysis for DividendDistributor.claimDividend()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function claimDividend.
            Check direct function security
                - function DividendDistributor.claimDividend() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function doesn't contain any require, if, or assert statements involving msg.sender that compare it to an Owner/Address/Leader/CEO for
                  validation.
                - function DividendDistributor.claimDividend() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures. It only contains a function call without any requirement checks or variable
                  assignments.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['RWRD.transfer(shareholder,amount)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - RWRD.transfer(shareholder,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - RWRD.transfer(shareholder,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['RWRD.transfer(shareholder,amount)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['RWRD'] should be checked in variable RWRD
        Checked variables: RWRD
            State variable RWRD has initialized in public area after declaration.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
