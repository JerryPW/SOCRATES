Function Security Analysis for OpportyBountyHold.unlockTokens()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function unlockTokens.
    Check direct function security
        - function OpportyBountyHold.unlockTokens() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not check for the sender's identity against a specific owner, leader, or address using any of the specified patterns.
        - function OpportyBountyHold.unlockTokens() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The structure is matched since both 'require(!holderList[msg.sender].withdrawed);' and 'holderList[msg.sender].withdrawed = true;' statements exist.
          However, the statement 'holderList[msg.sender].withdrawed = true;' occurs after the main logic of the function, specifically after 'token.transfer(...)'. Thus,
          the negation doesn't immediately follow the require statement before the primary logic is executed.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['token.transfer(msg.sender,holderList[msg.sender].tokens)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - token.transfer(msg.sender,holderList[msg.sender].tokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - token.transfer(msg.sender,holderList[msg.sender].tokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['token.transfer(msg.sender,holderList[msg.sender].tokens)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            No The function 'setToken' is not named after the contract name 'OpportyBountyHold' and is not explicitly named 'constructor', so it cannot be considered a
            constructor. Additionally, the function sets the 'token' state variable using a parameter ('newToken') rather than a hardcoded value. Therefore, it does not
            hardcode the provided state variable.
            Function Security Analysis for OpportyBountyHold.setToken(address)
                The modifier of function setToken are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The code uses 'require(msg.sender == owner);', ensuring only the owner can execute the function. This satisfies rule 1 as it enforces that
                      only a specific address (owner) can execute the function.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
