Function Security Analysis for Dividends.fallback()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
    Check direct function security
        - function Dividends.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function checks if msg.sender is not in the 'admins' mapping with value 1, which does not match any of the structures outlined in the criteria (it
          does not target a specific owner, address, leader, or CEO).
        - function Dividends.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not have any of the required structures where a variable 'xxx' is checked with 'require' or 'if' conditions and its value is toggled
          between 'True' or 'False'.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['tokenReward.balanceOf(user)', 'user.transfer(userether)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - user.transfer(userether) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains '.transfer('
        keyword, which satisfies condition 1.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - tokenReward.balanceOf(user) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['tokenReward.balanceOf(user)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['tokenReward'] should be checked in variable tokenReward
        Checked variables: tokenReward
            Yes 1. The function name 'Dividends' matches the contract name 'Dividends', which indicates it is a constructor.  2. The function does set the state variable
            'tokenReward' explicitly but it does not use a hardcoded value (since 'maintoken' is not provided as a constant here), hence this does not satisfy the
            hardcoded condition.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
