Function Security Analysis for ShortOrder.exerciseLong(address[2],uint256[8],uint8,bytes32[2])
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function exerciseLong.
    Check direct function security
        - function ShortOrder.exerciseLong(address[2],uint256[8],uint8,bytes32[2]) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not have any checks or requirements related to msg.sender being equal to a specific owner, address, leader, or CEO variable. It focuses
          mainly on ecrecover for orderHash verification and order condition checks.
        - function ShortOrder.exerciseLong(address[2],uint256[8],uint8,bytes32[2]) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon re-evaluating the code, we observe that the structural pattern required for a 'Yes' judgment is not fully met. The code contains a conditional
          check 'else if(!orderRecord[msg.sender][orderHash].tokenDeposit)' which matches part of the structure (3). However, the next statement 'msg.sender.transfer(...'
          does not assign 'orderRecord[msg.sender][orderHash].tokenDeposit = True;' Therefore, the pattern is incomplete. As all specified structural requirements must be
          met simultaneously and fully (including both conditional check and assignment as described), the correct judgment should be 'No.'
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['Token(tokenUser[0]).transfer(msg.sender,amount)', 'msg.sender.transfer(couponAmount)',
    'msg.sender.transfer(safeAdd(couponAmount,orderRecord[tokenUser[1]][orderHash].longBalance[msg.sender]))']
    Analyze Transfer
        - Token(tokenUser[0]).transfer(msg.sender,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - msg.sender.transfer(couponAmount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the
        keyword '.transfer('.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - msg.sender.transfer(safeAdd(couponAmount,orderRecord[tokenUser[1]][orderHash].longBalance[msg.sender])) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no
        potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the keyword '.transfer('.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - Token(tokenUser[0]).transfer(msg.sender,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['Token(tokenUser[0]).transfer(msg.sender,amount)']
    Analyze External Address
        The variable 'tokenUser' in external call 'Token(tokenUser[0]).transfer(msg.sender,amount)' has no state variable assigned in
        ShortOrder.exerciseLong(address[2],uint256[8],uint8,bytes32[2]). Therefore we check whether it has been hardcoded in the function.
            No The variable 'tokenUser' is not hardcoded as it is passed as an argument to the function 'exerciseLong'. The values for 'tokenUser' can vary each time the
            function is called, meaning it is not fixed or hardcoded within the function.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
