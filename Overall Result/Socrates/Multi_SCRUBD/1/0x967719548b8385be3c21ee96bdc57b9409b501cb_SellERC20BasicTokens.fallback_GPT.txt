Function Security Analysis for SellERC20BasicTokens.fallback()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
    Check direct function security
        - function SellERC20BasicTokens.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The provided code does not include any statement checking `msg.sender` against an owner or an address with the required authority. There are mainly
          checks related to amounts and balances, no specific owner or address check.
        - function SellERC20BasicTokens.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not contain any of the specified structures where a variable (represented here as 'xxx') is asserted with specific boolean values
          around a conditional statement that checks its value.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['msg.sender.transfer(weiAmount-weiExpense.mul(10**decimalDiff))', 'token.transfer(msg.sender,tokenBought)', 'token.balanceOf(address(this))']
    Analyze Transfer
        - msg.sender.transfer(weiAmount-weiExpense.mul(10**decimalDiff)) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The
        external call contains '.transfer('.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - token.transfer(msg.sender,tokenBought) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - token.transfer(msg.sender,tokenBought) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - token.balanceOf(address(this)) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['token.transfer(msg.sender,tokenBought)', 'token.balanceOf(address(this))']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            Yes 1. The function in the provided code is explicitly named 'constructor'. This matches one of the characteristics to be checked for: whether the code is a
            constructor.
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            Yes The function provided in the code is explicitly named 'constructor', satisfying the first characteristic of either being named as the contract's name or
            as 'constructor'. Therefore, it meets the constructor check criteria.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
