Function Security Analysis for Voting.addRaiseTapProposal(string,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function addRaiseTapProposal.
    Check direct function security
        - function Voting.addRaiseTapProposal(string,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any statement verifying msg.sender against a specific owner, leader, CEO, or address with exclusive rights using
          `require`, `if`, or `assert`. Therefore, it does not match any of the listed structures.
        - function Voting.addRaiseTapProposal(string,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: In the provided code, although the structure corresponding to characteristic 3 is present where 'require(!queued[uint(Subject.RaiseTap)])' checks the
          state and later 'queued[uint(Subject.RaiseTap)] = true;' negates it, this negation does not happen immediately after the 'require' statement. The statement
          'addProposal' is executed in between, indicating that the match does not immediately perform state negation before executing the main logic of the function.
          Therefore, it does not fully meet the criteria set forth in the task.

Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: Voting.addProposal(Voting.Subject,string)
Function Security Analysis for Voting.addProposal(Voting.Subject,string)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function addProposal.
    Check direct function security
        - function Voting.addProposal(Voting.Subject,string) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not utilize any checking of msg.sender against any Owner/Address/Leader/CEO variables or conditions.
        - function Voting.addProposal(Voting.Subject,string) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the required structures of either setting a checked variable to False after requiring it to be True or vice versa, or
          throwing an exception based on a negated variable before setting it true or false. It only contains require statements checking conditions unrelated to setting
          variables true or false.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['addRaiseTapProposal', 'addDestructionProposal']
        Function Security Analysis for Voting.addRaiseTapProposal(string,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function addRaiseTapProposal.
            Check direct function security
                - function Voting.addRaiseTapProposal(string,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not include any conditions or assertions that specifically check whether 'msg.sender' is equal to or not equal to any form of
                  'xxxOwner', 'xxxAddress', 'Leader', or 'CEO'.
                - function Voting.addRaiseTapProposal(string,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: In the provided code, the first matched portion is 'require(!queued[uint(Subject.RaiseTap)]);', and the subsequent line that negates the state
                  is 'queued[uint(Subject.RaiseTap)] = true;'. However, between these two actions, significant logic is executed ('uint256 newID =
                  addProposal(Subject.RaiseTap, _reason);'), which is the main functionality of the function. The negation operation should occur immediately after the
                  state check, but here, it's performed after the main logic, which does not meet the revised negation requirement.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['DaicoPool(poolAddr).isStateProjectInProgress()', 'poolAddr.transfer(msg.value)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - poolAddr.transfer(msg.value) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        'poolAddr.transfer(msg.value)' contains the '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - DaicoPool(poolAddr).isStateProjectInProgress() ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['DaicoPool(poolAddr).isStateProjectInProgress()']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['poolAddr'] should be checked in variable poolAddr
        Checked variables: poolAddr
            Yes 1. The function in the provided code is named 'constructor', which matches one of the characteristics we are to check (whether the code is a constructor).
            Therefore, it satisfies the first rule. 2. The state variable 'poolAddr' is not hardcoded; it is set using a parameter '_poolAddr'. Therefore, the second
            characteristic does not apply here.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
