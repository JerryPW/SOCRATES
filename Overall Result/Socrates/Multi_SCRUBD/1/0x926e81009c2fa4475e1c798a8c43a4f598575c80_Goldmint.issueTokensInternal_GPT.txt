            Check direct function security
                - function Goldmint.buyTokens(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain any statements that match the specified structures for checking msg.sender against a specific owner or address
                  condition.
                - function Goldmint.buyTokens(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: There is no usage of the require statement matching the specific structures mentioned. The require statement here checks if msg.value is not
                  equal to 0, which does not fulfill criteria 1, 2, 3, or 4.
