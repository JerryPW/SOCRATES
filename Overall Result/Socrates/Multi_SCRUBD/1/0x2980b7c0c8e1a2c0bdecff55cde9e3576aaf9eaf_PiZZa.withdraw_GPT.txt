        The variable 'sender' in external call 'sender.call{value:amount}()' has no state variable assigned in PiZZa.withdraw(uint256). Therefore we check whether it has
        been hardcoded in the function.
            No The variable sender is assigned dynamically from msg.sender, which represents the address initiating the transaction or calling the function in Ethereum's
            environment. This means it is determined at runtime based on who the call is coming from, rather than being pre-set or hardcoded within the function itself.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
