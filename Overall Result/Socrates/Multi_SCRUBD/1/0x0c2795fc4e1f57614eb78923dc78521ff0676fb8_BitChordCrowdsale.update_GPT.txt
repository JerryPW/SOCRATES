Function Security Analysis for BitChordCrowdsale.update()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function update.
    Check direct function security
        - function BitChordCrowdsale.update() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The provided function does not involve any condition checking msg.sender against an Owner/Address/Leader/CEO. It only makes an oraclize query and
          adjusts the oraclizeBalance.
        - function BitChordCrowdsale.update() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not match any of the specified structures. There are no require or if statements checking the state of a variable ('xxx') and
          then modifying it as specified.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['__callback', '__callback']

            Check direct function security
                - function BitChordCrowdsale.__callback(bytes32,string,bytes) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: In the provided code, the statement `require(msg.sender == oraclize_cbAddress());` does check msg.sender against a specific address provided by
                  `oraclize_cbAddress()`. Although this seems to fit the pattern of checking against a specific address, it does not explicitly mention 'Owner',
                  'Address', 'Leader', or 'CEO'. Therefore, based on strict matching criteria with the mentioned keywords, it does not satisfy the required structures for
                  outputting 'Yes'.
                - function BitChordCrowdsale.__callback(bytes32,string,bytes) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code provided does not contain any of the specified structures. It does have a require statement to check the sender's address, but this
                  does not match the described patterns as it does not set the variable to true or false after the require statement. Additionally, no 'require(xxx ==
                  False)' or 'require(!xxx)' patterns (structure 2 and 3), or 'if(!xxx) throw' pattern (structure 4) is present. Therefore, it does not meet any of the
                  conditions.

Start analyze function: usingOraclize.oraclize_getPrice(string)
Function Security Analysis for usingOraclize.oraclize_getPrice(string)
    The modifier of function oraclize_getPrice are ['oraclizeAPI']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier oraclizeAPI has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier 'oraclizeAPI' does not contain checks related to ownership or specific addresses with permissions. It also does not involve a lock
          mechanism. Furthermore, the name 'oraclizeAPI' does not suggest a relation to ownership restrictions or reentrancy protection.

        - function usingOraclize.oraclize_getPrice(string) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures requiring a check against msg.sender related to an Owner, Address, Leader or CEO.
        - function usingOraclize.oraclize_getPrice(string) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not include any 'require' or 'if' statements, nor any boolean variable assignments that match the given patterns.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

            Check direct function security
                - function BitChordCrowdsale.__callback(bytes32,string,bytes) has security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender, the function would
                not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The function contains 'require(msg.sender == oraclize_cbAddress());'. Although oraclize_cbAddress is not a literal like xxxOwner or xxxAddress,
                  it is a function call that serves the same logical purpose for checking sender address, fitting criterion 1.
        Function Security Analysis for BitChordCrowdsale.startOraclize(uint256)
            The modifier of function startOraclize are ['onlyOwner']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The modifier `onlyOwner` includes a `require` statement that ensures only the `owner` can execute the function, which satisfies the first
                  characteristic of enforcing execution restrictions based on the `msg.sender`. No structural omissions are detected as the code clearly includes this
                  enforcement.

                - function BitChordCrowdsale.update() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function 'update' does not contain any of the specified statement structures related to 'msg.sender'. It only makes an oraclize query and
                  updates the oraclize balance.
                - function BitChordCrowdsale.update() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not have the specified structures related to requirement checks and logical assignments. It simply performs a query and balance
                  subtraction.

                        function would not cause REE problem.
                          Reason: The function contains 'require(msg.sender == oraclize_cbAddress());', which matches the first structure since 'oraclize_cbAddress()' is
                          not a local variable but a call likely representing an address, qualifying it as 'xxxAddress' in the described structure.

            Yes 1. The function name matches the contract name 'BitChordCrowdsale', indicating it is a constructor. 2. The code does not hardcode the state variable
            'oraclize'; it assigns a value to it dynamically using 'oraclize = OraclizeI(OAR.getAddress());'.  Since the function matches the constructor naming rule, the
            answer is 'Yes'.

    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier oraclizeAPI has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier `oraclizeAPI` does not enforce that only the owner or specific addresses can execute the function, nor does it use a lock operation to
          ensure the function enters only once. It appears to be related to checking or setting up a network, which is unrelated to ownership or lock operations.

        - function usingOraclize.oraclize_query(uint256,string,string) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not contain the structures as specified in the criteria. It doesn't have require statements or the specific conditional and

                  Reason: Upon reevaluation, the code contains 'require(msg.sender == oraclize_cbAddress());', which indeed matches structure 1: require(msg.sender ==

        Checked variables: oraclize
            Yes The function 'BitChordCrowdsale' has the same name as the contract 'BitChordCrowdsale', indicating that it is a constructor. Constructors are special
            functions that are executed once when the contract is deployed, rather than functions that can be called externally later on. Since constructors inherently
            implicate state-changing operations but don't fit the typical function criteria, and the function name matches the contract name exactly, this satisfies the
            first characteristic - it's identified as a constructor.
        There are ['oraclize'] should be checked in variable oraclize
        Checked variables: oraclize
            Yes 1. The function name matches the contract name 'BitChordCrowdsale', suggesting it is the contract's constructor.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
