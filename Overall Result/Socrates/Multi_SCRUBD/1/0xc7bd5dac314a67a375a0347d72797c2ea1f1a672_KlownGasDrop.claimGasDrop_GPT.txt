    Check direct function security
        - function KlownGasDrop.claimGasDrop() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures that involve checks on 'msg.sender' matching specific owner or admin roles like
          xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
        - function KlownGasDrop.claimGasDrop() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon reconsidering the code, the condition `if(receivers[msg.sender] != true)` serves as a check similar to the 'require' or 'if' condition as defined
          in the task. However, the code only provides the condition and the assignment `receivers[msg.sender] = true;`, but it lacks an explicit `require(!xxx)` or
          `if(!xxx) throw;` structure with the throw statement as described. Therefore, both conditions for the assessed structure (only the first two statements needed
          for confirmation) are not adequately satisfied, as one is missing.
