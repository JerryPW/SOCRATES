Function Security Analysis for BoomerangLiquidity.payout()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function payout.
    Check direct function security
        - function BoomerangLiquidity.payout() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not have any check involving msg.sender against xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO. It focuses on balance checks and interacting with
          participants for payouts.
        - function BoomerangLiquidity.payout() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures. It uses a require statement, but it is checking if 'balance > 1', not if 'xxx == True' or
          'xxx == False'. There are no boolean assignments following the require statement that match the specified structures.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.call.value(payoutToSend).gas(1000000)()', 'participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.send(payoutToSend)',
    'weak_hands.buy.value(investment).gas(1000000)(msg.sender)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.send(payoutToSend) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The
        external call contains '.send(' keyword, which satisfies the given condition.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - The gas limit in participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.call.value(payoutToSend).gas(1000000)() is 1000000, which is too high. Therefore, it will not prevent
        REE problem.
        - The gas limit in weak_hands.buy.value(investment).gas(1000000)(msg.sender) is 1000000, which is too high. Therefore, it will not prevent REE problem.
    Remaining external call: ['participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.call.value(payoutToSend).gas(1000000)()',
    'weak_hands.buy.value(investment).gas(1000000)(msg.sender)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['participants'] should be checked in variable participants
        Checked variables: participants
            No The code provided does not contain a constructor. The functions 'deposit' and 'payout' do not match the contract name 'BoomerangLiquidity', nor are they
            explicitly named 'constructor'. Additionally, the state variable 'participants' is used dynamically in the code, without being hardcoded with any specific
            values. The variable is manipulated through operations like pushing new participants and modifying payout amounts, but these do not constitute hardcoded
            values as defined by the rule.
            Function Security Analysis for BoomerangLiquidity.deposit()
                There are no modifiers should be examined in function deposit.
                Check direct function security
                    - function BoomerangLiquidity.deposit() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                      Reason: The given function does not contain any conditions or assertions related to msg.sender being a specific owner, address, or role like
                      Leader/CEO. It neither checks msg.sender with require, if, or assert statements nor throws if msg.sender does not match these roles.
                    - function BoomerangLiquidity.deposit() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                      Reason: The given function does not contain any of the specified structures. It neither uses a 'require' statement nor an 'if...throw' statement.
                      Furthermore, the function deals with operations involving participants and payouts, which do not relate to the control structures in the specified
                      patterns.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
