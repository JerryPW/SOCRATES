Function Security Analysis for MessierAnonymity.swapAndShare()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function swapAndShare.
    Check direct function security
        - function MessierAnonymity.swapAndShare() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the required structures related to authorization checks based on the sender's address that determine access control
          regarding specific roles such as owner, leader, or CEO.
        - function MessierAnonymity.swapAndShare() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code checks if 'collectedFee' is greater than 0 using a 'require' statement, but it doesn't flip or change the boolean variable. The structure
          '{require(xxx == True); xxx = False; ... xxx = True;}' or similar is not present in the code.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['deposit', 'forceSwapAndShare']
        Function Security Analysis for MessierAnonymity.deposit(bytes32)
            The modifier of function deposit are ['nonReentrant']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier nonReentrant is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The modifier 'nonReentrant' explicitly uses a lock mechanism by incrementing '_guardCounter' to protect against reentrancy, which satisfies rule
                  2. Specifically, it locks the state by modifying '_guardCounter' at the start and checks it at the end to ensure the function cannot be reentered until
                  it is completed.
        Function Security Analysis for MessierAnonymity.forceSwapAndShare()
            The modifier of function forceSwapAndShare are ['onlyOwner']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The modifier uses 'require(msg.sender == messier_owner, ...)', which checks that the caller is the owner (messier_owner), satisfying Rule 1.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
