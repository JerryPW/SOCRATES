Function Security Analysis for DividendDistributor.distributeDividend(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function distributeDividend.
    Check direct function security
        - function DividendDistributor.distributeDividend(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not have any requirement or condition checking msg.sender regarding ownership or specific address roles, nor does it involve any
          'assert' related to this context.
        - function DividendDistributor.distributeDividend(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures involving a require statement or an if statement with the specified characteristics.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['process', 'setShare', 'claimDividend']
        Function Security Analysis for DividendDistributor.process(uint256)
            The modifier of function process are ['onlyToken']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyToken is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: Upon reviewing the code, the 'onlyToken' modifier uses 'require(msg.sender == _token);' to ensure that only the specific address stored in
                  '_token' can execute the function. This matches characteristic 1: enforcing that only a specific address can execute the function. There is no sign of a
                  lock operation as described in characteristic 2 within the modifier, so it does not apply here.
        Function Security Analysis for DividendDistributor.setShare(address,uint256)
            The modifier of function setShare are ['onlyToken']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyToken is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The judgment is based on rule 1, as the modifier enforces that only a specific address (_token) can execute the function due to the condition
                  'require(msg.sender == _token);'. There is no presence of structure 2 (lock and unlock operation) in this code snippet, only the ownership/address
                  verification.
        Function Security Analysis for DividendDistributor.claimDividend()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function claimDividend.
            Check direct function security
                - function DividendDistributor.claimDividend() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any require, if, or assert statements that check msg.sender against any owner-like entity.
                - function DividendDistributor.claimDividend() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures. It simply calls a function `distributeDividend` with `msg.sender` as an
                  argument.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['rewardToken.transfer(shareholder,amount)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - rewardToken.transfer(shareholder,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - rewardToken.transfer(shareholder,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['rewardToken.transfer(shareholder,amount)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['rewardToken'] should be checked in variable rewardToken
        Checked variables: rewardToken
            Yes The function is explicitly a constructor of the contract since it is named 'constructor'. This satisfies the first characteristic of checking if the
            provided code is a constructor.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
