    Check direct function security
        - function MyAdvancedToken8.sell(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not include any statements that directly check if the msg.sender is a specific owner or leader, such as require, if, or assert
          statements checking msg.sender equality or inequality to xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
        - function MyAdvancedToken8.sell(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function does not meet any of the specified patterns. There is no 'require(xxx == True)' or 'require(xxx == False)' with subsequent assignments as
          specified. Instead, the code contains a simple revert mechanism without assignments directly following it. The condition 'if (!sendSUCCESS)' followed by a
          revert is present but does not match the structural requirement for direct assignment 'sendSUCCESS = true'.
