Function Security Analysis for ViVICO.successful()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function successful.
    Check direct function security
        - function ViVICO.successful() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the required structures involving 'msg.sender'. Specifically, there is no use of 'msg.sender' in relation to the
          ownership or specific address checks that must validate conditions like equality or inequality with certain roles (Owner, Address, Leader, CEO).
        - function ViVICO.successful() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code contains a statement `require(state == State.Successful);` but does not include `state = State.Unsuccessful` or vice versa, or equivalent logic
          adjustments with the associated variable `state`. Therefore, the necessary structure outlined is not entirely present in the given code.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['tokenReward.balanceOf(this)', 'creator.transfer(address(this).balance)', 'tokenReward.transfer(creator,remanent)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - creator.transfer(address(this).balance) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        'creator.transfer(address(this).balance)' contains '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - tokenReward.transfer(creator,remanent) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - tokenReward.balanceOf(this) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - tokenReward.transfer(creator,remanent) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['tokenReward.balanceOf(this)', 'tokenReward.transfer(creator,remanent)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['tokenReward'] should be checked in variable tokenReward
        Checked variables: tokenReward
            Yes The function is named 'constructor', which matches the characteristic of being a constructor function.
        There are ['tokenReward'] should be checked in variable tokenReward
        Checked variables: tokenReward
            Yes The function provided is explicitly named 'constructor'. This indicates that it is indeed a constructor function, which matches the first characteristic
            outlined.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
