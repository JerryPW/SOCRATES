Start analyze function: Contagion.Sort()
Function Security Analysis for Contagion.Sort()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function Sort.
    Check direct function security
        - function Contagion.Sort() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified checks regarding msg.sender.
        - function Contagion.Sort() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function does not have any of the required structures. It involves arithmetic operations, sending ether, and modifying a transaction log, but does
          not check a variable with "require" or an "if" statement according to any of the specified patterns.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['fallback']
        Function Security Analysis for Contagion.fallback()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
            Check direct function security
                - function Contagion.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function contains 'if (msg.sender == owner)', which is technically a comparison similar to 'require' or 'assert'. It does not match exactly
                  with any of the given conditions because there is no negation or logic surrounding access control based on msg.sender alone. Thus, none of the specified
                  conditions are directly satisfied.
                - function Contagion.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any structure matching the patterns specified. It has a require statement, but it is not followed by resetting a
                  boolean variable. None of the specified structures with 'require' or 'if' are present where a boolean variable is toggled.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['owner.send(feecounter)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - owner.send(feecounter) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the '.send('
        keyword, which satisfies one of the specified conditions.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
