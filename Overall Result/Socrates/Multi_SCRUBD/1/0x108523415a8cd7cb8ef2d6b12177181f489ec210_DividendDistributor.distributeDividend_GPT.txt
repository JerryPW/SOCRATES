Function Security Analysis for DividendDistributor.distributeDividend(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function distributeDividend.
    Check direct function security
        - function DividendDistributor.distributeDividend(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any checks related to msg.sender involving an owner, address, leader, or CEO as required by the specified characteristics.
        - function DividendDistributor.distributeDividend(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not have any line matching the specific structures provided.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['setShare', 'process', 'claimDividend']
        Function Security Analysis for DividendDistributor.setShare(address,uint256)
            The modifier of function setShare are ['onlyToken']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyToken is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: Rule 1 is satisfied because the modifier enforces that only a specific address 'token' can execute the function. The code structure
                  'require(msg.sender == token);' ensures this validation.
        Function Security Analysis for DividendDistributor.process(uint256)
            The modifier of function process are ['onlyToken']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyToken is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The modifier 'onlyToken' uses the structure 'require(msg.sender == token);' which explicitly checks if the caller is a specific address (token).
                  This matches rule 1, where the code ensures that only a specific address can execute the function.
        Function Security Analysis for DividendDistributor.claimDividend(address)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function claimDividend.
            Check direct function security
                - function DividendDistributor.claimDividend(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function claimDividend does not contain any code that checks or requires msg.sender to be a specific owner or address.
                - function DividendDistributor.claimDividend(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures, such as require or if statements checking a condition on a variable followed by
                  changing the value of the same variable.

        - USDC.transfer(shareholder,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - USDC.transfer(shareholder,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['USDC.transfer(shareholder,amount)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['USDC'] should be checked in variable USDC
        Checked variables: USDC
            State variable USDC has initialized in public area after declaration.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
