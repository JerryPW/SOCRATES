Function Security Analysis for BuybackBabyToken._transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _transferFrom.
    Check direct function security
        - function BuybackBabyToken._transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The provided code does not include any checks or assertions related to msg.sender. It focuses on transferring, managing balances, and handling dividends
          without restricting actions based on the message sender's address.
        - function BuybackBabyToken._transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain a require statement or an if-throw structure that matches any of the defined patterns, as no explicit require or if-throw
          validation is present for a boolean variable that is followed by a change in the boolean's state.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transfer', 'transferFrom']
        Function Security Analysis for BuybackBabyToken.transfer(address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transfer.
            Check direct function security
                - function BuybackBabyToken.transfer(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The provided code checks for msg.sender using a function call to _transferFrom, which is not within the specified structures of direct
                  comparison with xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO. The code doesn't have any require, if, throw, or assert structures given in the characteristics list
                  that directly compares msg.sender.
                - function BuybackBabyToken.transfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided function does not contain any require statements or if(!xxx) throw statements followed by setting a boolean variable as described
                  in the patterns. It simply overrides an external function and calls another internal function without any of the outlined structures.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['distributor.setShare(recipient,_balances[recipient])', 'distributor.process(distributorGas)',
    'distributor.setShare(sender,_balances[sender])']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - distributor.setShare(recipient,_balances[recipient]) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - distributor.process(distributorGas) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Here is the reason: The variable `distributorGas` is initially set to 500000 in the
        constructor and can only be modified by the function `setDistributorSettings`. This function allows the `distributorGas` to be updated with a new value `gas` but
        imposes a requirement that `gas` must be less than 750000. Since 750000 is greater than 3000, the value of `distributorGas` can be set to something greater than
        3000, up to just under 750000. Therefore, it is possible for `distributorGas` to exceed 3000.  Thus, the condition to check whether `distributorGas` is always
        less than or equal to 3000 does not hold true. The variable is allowed to be set to values greater than 3000 according to the function logic.
        - distributor.setShare(sender,_balances[sender]) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['distributor.setShare(recipient,_balances[recipient])', 'distributor.process(distributorGas)',
    'distributor.setShare(sender,_balances[sender])']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['distributor'] should be checked in variable distributor
        Checked variables: distributor
            Yes The provided function is named 'constructor', which matches the naming requirement for identifying a constructor. Therefore, the function satisfies the
            first characteristic of being a constructor.
        There are ['distributor'] should be checked in variable distributor
        Checked variables: distributor
            Yes The provided code is a constructor for the contract 'BuybackBabyToken'. The function is explicitly named 'constructor' and does not mention or hardcode
            the state variable 'distributor'.
        There are ['distributor'] should be checked in variable distributor
        Checked variables: distributor
            Yes The provided code includes a constructor function, as it is defined with the keyword 'constructor' and matches the characteristics in the rules. The
            constructor is initializing the contract with parameters and setting up initial values for various state variables, such as creating an instance of
            'DividendDistributor' using 'distributor'. However, there is no indication that the state variable 'distributor' is hardcoded within the constructor. But
            since it satisfies the first rule of being a constructor, the output is 'Yes'.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: BuybackBabyToken.swapBack()
Function Security Analysis for BuybackBabyToken.swapBack()
    The modifier of function swapBack are ['swapping']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier swapping is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The code modifier 'swapping' sets a flag 'inSwap' to true before the function executes (indicating a lock operation) and resets 'inSwap' to false after
          the function finishes (indicating an unlock operation). Both operations are present and matched, which ensures that the function enters only once, complying
          with rule 2.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: BuybackBabyToken.triggerAutoBuyback()
Function Security Analysis for BuybackBabyToken.triggerAutoBuyback()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function triggerAutoBuyback.
    Check direct function security
        - function BuybackBabyToken.triggerAutoBuyback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any checks or conditions involving 'msg.sender'.
        - function BuybackBabyToken.triggerAutoBuyback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not satisfy any of the specified structures. There is no requirement statement or condition that matches the specified patterns. It sets a
          variable `autoBuybackEnabled` to false, but there is no preceding requirement or check for this variable meeting the required format.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transfer', '_transferFrom', 'transferFrom']
        Function Security Analysis for BuybackBabyToken.transfer(address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transfer.
            Check direct function security
                - function BuybackBabyToken.transfer(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not check the `msg.sender` against any specific owner or authorized address using any of the listed structures.
                - function BuybackBabyToken.transfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code block lacks the required patterns. It simply defines a function that calls another function without requiring any conditions
                  of a boolean variable or manipulating its value as described in the given structures.

    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: BuybackBabyToken.buyTokens(uint256,address)
Function Security Analysis for BuybackBabyToken.buyTokens(uint256,address)
    The modifier of function buyTokens are ['swapping']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier swapping is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: Rule 2 applies because the modifier uses a lock mechanism where the `inSwap` flag is set to `true` at the beginning and resets it to `false` afterward,
          ensuring the function enters only once.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
