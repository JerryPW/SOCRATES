Function Security Analysis for Voting.addDestructionProposal(string)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function addDestructionProposal.
    Check direct function security
        - function Voting.addDestructionProposal(string) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any condition or enforcement to check if `msg.sender` equals to any specific owner or authority (xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader,
          CEO).
        - function Voting.addDestructionProposal(string) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not immediately perform a state negation operation on 'queued[uint(Subject.Destruction)]' after the require statement. The main logic
          function 'addProposal' is executed before 'queued[uint(Subject.Destruction)] = true;' is assigned. Therefore, it does not satisfy the criteria as the negation
          should occur before the main logic of the function.

    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: Voting.addProposal(Voting.Subject,string)
Function Security Analysis for Voting.addProposal(Voting.Subject,string)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function addProposal.
    Check direct function security
        - function Voting.addProposal(Voting.Subject,string) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function `addProposal` does not contain any checks or assertions related to `msg.sender` being equal to a specific owner or address, such as
          `xxxOwner`, `xxxAddress`, `Leader`, or `CEO`. The code only checks for the transfer amount and project state.
        - function Voting.addProposal(Voting.Subject,string) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code is checked against predefined patterns. It has require statements checking for conditions but does not use the structure of modifying
          the same boolean variable post-require. It does not fit any of the specified structures involving require(condition); xxx = value; or throw statements, so the
          answer is 'No'.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['addDestructionProposal', 'addRaiseTapProposal']
        Function Security Analysis for Voting.addDestructionProposal(string)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function addDestructionProposal.
            Check direct function security
                - function Voting.addDestructionProposal(string) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code lacks any explicit structure checking `msg.sender` against a specific owner, address or leadership role through require, if, throw or
                  assert statements as described.
                - function Voting.addDestructionProposal(string) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not satisfy the conditions because although it matches structure 3 with `require(!queued[uint(Subject.Destruction)]);` and
                  `queued[uint(Subject.Destruction)] = true;`, the state negation (`queued[uint(Subject.Destruction)] = true;`) is not immediately performed after the
                  `require` statement. Instead, there is a call to `addProposal(Subject.Destruction, _reason);` in between, which is part of the function's main logic.
                  Thus, the state negation is not completed before the main logic of the function executes.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['DaicoPool(poolAddr).isStateProjectInProgress()', 'poolAddr.transfer(msg.value)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - poolAddr.transfer(msg.value) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: This external call contains the
        '.transfer(' keyword, satisfying the first characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - DaicoPool(poolAddr).isStateProjectInProgress() ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['DaicoPool(poolAddr).isStateProjectInProgress()']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['poolAddr'] should be checked in variable poolAddr
        Checked variables: poolAddr
            Yes The given code is explicitly a constructor for the contract named Voting. The function is labeled as 'constructor', and it matches the rules for
            characteristic 1.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
