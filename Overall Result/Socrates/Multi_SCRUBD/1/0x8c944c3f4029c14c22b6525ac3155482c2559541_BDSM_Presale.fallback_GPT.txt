Function Security Analysis for BDSM_Presale.fallback()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
    Check direct function security
        - function BDSM_Presale.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: None of the specified conditional checks (require, if, assert) use msg.sender comparisons to check ownership or authority against
          xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
        - function BDSM_Presale.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code contains if(!tokensWithdrawn) followed by tokensWithdrawn = true. However, this state negation operation is not immediately performed upon
          checking the state. It occurs within a conditional block that's dependent on other checks related to the presale timing. Thus, it does not meet the requirements
          for immediate state negation after the initial check.

    Analyze External Address
        There are ['sharesTokenAddress'] should be checked in variable sharesTokenAddress
        Checked variables: sharesTokenAddress
            Yes The function name matches the contract name 'BDSM_Presale', indicating it is a constructor. Constructors are special functions that initialize the
            contract's state variables at deployment, and thus, it satisfies the first characteristic of being a constructor function.
        There are ['sharesTokenAddress'] should be checked in variable sharesTokenAddress
        Checked variables: sharesTokenAddress
            Yes The code provided has a function named 'BDSM_Presale', which matches the contract name 'BDSM_Presale'. This indicates that the function is a constructor.
            Constructors are special functions used for initializing smart contracts and are identified by having the same name as the contract (in older Solidity
            versions) or being explicitly named 'constructor' in newer versions.
        There are ['sharesTokenAddress'] should be checked in variable sharesTokenAddress
        Checked variables: sharesTokenAddress
            Yes The function name 'BDSM_Presale' matches the contract name, indicating that this is a constructor. The function also assigns a value to the state variable
            'sharesTokenAddress' using a parameter '_tokenAddress', indicating that the state variable is hardcoded within the constructor.
        There are ['sharesTokenAddress'] should be checked in variable sharesTokenAddress
        Checked variables: sharesTokenAddress
            Yes The function name matches the contract name (BDSM_Presale). Therefore, it is a constructor.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
