Function Security Analysis for Lottery10ETH.drawing()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function drawing.
    Check direct function security
        - function Lottery10ETH.drawing() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any statement with 'msg.sender' being compared to an 'xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO'. It does not meet any of the specified
          characteristics.
        - function Lottery10ETH.drawing() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function does not include any of the specified patterns. The only 'require' statement checks a condition on 'block.number' and there are no require
          statements that assign to a variable after the check in the specified manner.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['fallback']
        Function Security Analysis for Lottery10ETH.fallback()
            The modifier of function fallback are ['notFromContract']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier notFromContract has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier does not check for ownership or specific addresses and doesn't implement a lock mechanism, nor does it have a name suggesting such
                  a mechanism.
            Check direct function security
                - function Lottery10ETH.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The provided code does not contain any checks or assertions involving 'msg.sender == xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO'. It also does not contain
                  checks where 'msg.sender != xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO' is in a conditional that leads to an error or early exit in the function.
                - function Lottery10ETH.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The given code does not match any of the specified structures. There is no use of 'require' with 'xxx == True' or 'xxx == False', and the same
                  applies for 'require(!xxx)'. Additionally, there is no 'if(!xxx) throw;' structure followed by setting 'xxx = true'. Therefore, none of the outlined
                  characteristics are present.

    Analyze Transfer
        - owner.send(fee) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call 'owner.send(fee)' contains '.send('..
        Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - players[winnerIdx].send(brilliant[1]) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call
        'players[winnerIdx].send(brilliant[1])' contains '.send('.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - winner.send(silver[1]) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call 'winner.send(silver[1])' contains
        '.send('.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - addresses[k].send(goldenPrize) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call
        'addresses[k].send(goldenPrize)' contains '.send('.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - msg.sender.send(txCost) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call 'msg.sender.send(txCost)' contains
        '.send('.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - x.draw(goldenWinners) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - RS.sendBonus(addresses[k]) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - WT.emitEvent(players[winnerIdx]) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - x.count() ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - WT.emitEvent(addresses[k]) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - WT.emitEvent(winner) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['x.draw(goldenWinners)', 'RS.sendBonus(addresses[k])', 'WT.emitEvent(players[winnerIdx])', 'x.count()', 'WT.emitEvent(addresses[k])',

    Analyze External Address
        There are ['x'] should be checked in variable x
        Checked variables: x
            Yes The provided code contains a constructor function as its first line defines a function named 'constructor'. This matches the characteristic of being
            explicitly named 'constructor', satisfying the first condition.
        There are ['RS'] should be checked in variable RS
        Checked variables: RS
            Yes The provided function is a constructor as it matches the contract name 'Lottery10ETH'. Constructors are special functions in Ethereum smart contracts that
            are executed during the contract's deployment and are used to initialize the contract's state variables.
        There are ['WT'] should be checked in variable WT
        Checked variables: WT
            Yes The provided code snippet is confirmed to be a constructor function because it is explicitly named 'constructor'. The function also assigns a new instance
            to the state variable 'WT', but this does not count as hardcoding a value since it's an assignment of an instance.
        There are ['x'] should be checked in variable x
        Checked variables: x
            Yes 1. The provided code contains a function which is named 'constructor', so it meets the criteria for a constructor. 2. The state variable 'x' is assigned a
            new instance of 'Storage' in the constructor, which is considered as a hardcoded assignment.
        There are ['WT'] should be checked in variable WT
        Checked variables: WT
            Yes The provided code is a constructor because the function name is 'constructor'. In Solidity, if a function is explicitly named 'constructor', it is treated
            as a constructor function, regardless of the contract's name. This satisfies the first characteristic we are checking for.
        There are ['WT'] should be checked in variable WT
        Checked variables: WT
            Yes The function provided is explicitly named 'constructor', indicating that it is a constructor function. Constructor functions are used for initializing a
            contract, and they do not need to check or modify specific state variables unless required by the contract's logic.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
