Function Security Analysis for NamiExchange.sellNac(uint256,address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function sellNac.
    Check direct function security
        - function NamiExchange.sellNac(uint256,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not include any checks involving specific roles like xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO tied to msg.sender. It purely verifies
          conditions like token allowances and bid parameters without role-based restrictions.
        - function NamiExchange.sellNac(uint256,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code snippet does not meet the format criteria as it doesn't contain a require statement that immediately changes the value of a variable as
          described, nor does it contain an if(!xxx) throw followed by xxx = true. It primarily uses require statements for input validation without the specified
          structure.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['namiToken.transferFrom(msg.sender,_buyer,_value)', 'namiToken.allowance(msg.sender,this)', 'msg.sender.send(ethOfBuyer)',
    'namiToken.transferFrom(msg.sender,_buyer,maxToken)', 'msg.sender.send(eth)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - msg.sender.send(ethOfBuyer) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        'msg.sender.send(ethOfBuyer)' contains '.send(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - msg.sender.send(eth) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call 'msg.sender.send(eth)'
        contains '.send(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - namiToken.transferFrom(msg.sender,_buyer,_value) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - namiToken.allowance(msg.sender,this) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - namiToken.transferFrom(msg.sender,_buyer,maxToken) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['namiToken.transferFrom(msg.sender,_buyer,_value)', 'namiToken.allowance(msg.sender,this)',
    'namiToken.transferFrom(msg.sender,_buyer,maxToken)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['NamiAddr'] should be checked in variable namiToken
        Checked variables: NamiAddr
            Yes The provided code is a constructor function because its name matches the contract name, 'NamiExchange'. Constructor functions are typically used to
            initialize contract state when the contract is deployed and their names usually match the contract name (in Solidity versions prior to 0.4.22, where
            'constructor' is explicitly used).
        There are ['NamiAddr'] should be checked in variable namiToken
        Checked variables: NamiAddr
            Yes The function 'NamiExchange' matches the contract name 'NamiExchange', indicating that it is a constructor. This satisfies the first characteristic.
        There are ['NamiAddr'] should be checked in variable namiToken
        Checked variables: NamiAddr
            Yes The function name 'NamiExchange' matches the contract name 'NamiExchange', which indicates that it is the constructor for this contract. Thus, it
            satisfies the first characteristic.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
