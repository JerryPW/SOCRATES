    There are no modifiers should be examined in function refund.
    Check direct function security
        - function EthTokenToSmthSwaps.refund(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any checks related to msg.sender being compared to an owner, address, or leader role; it only checks conditions on the
          swap's balance and timing.
        - function EthTokenToSmthSwaps.refund(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code contains no statements matching the specified structures. The 'require' statements check conditions, but there are no assignments to a variable
          immediately after these checks, nor is there an improper handling of boolean switching as stipulated in the rules.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['ERC20(swap.token).transfer(msg.sender,swap.balance)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - ERC20(swap.token).transfer(msg.sender,swap.balance) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - ERC20(swap.token).transfer(msg.sender,swap.balance) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['ERC20(swap.token).transfer(msg.sender,swap.balance)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['swaps'] should be checked in variable swap
        Checked variables: swaps
            No 1. Checking for constructor: None of the functions provided are constructors. The contract name is 'EthTokenToSmthSwaps', and none of the function names
            match this, nor is there an explicitly named 'constructor' function.  2. Checking for hardcoded state variable: The provided state variable is 'swaps'. None
            of the functions feature a hardcoded value for this variable. The variable is accessed and manipulated dynamically based on input parameters in functions such
            as 'createSwap', 'withdraw', etc.
            Function Security Analysis for EthTokenToSmthSwaps.createSwap(bytes20,address,uint256,address)
                There are no modifiers should be examined in function createSwap.
                Check direct function security
                    - function EthTokenToSmthSwaps.createSwap(bytes20,address,uint256,address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                      Reason: The code does not contain any checks involving msg.sender matching an Owner/Address/Leader/CEO.
                    - function EthTokenToSmthSwaps.createSwap(bytes20,address,uint256,address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                      Reason: The function checks several conditions using 'require' statements, but none of them matches any of the specific structures mentioned.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
