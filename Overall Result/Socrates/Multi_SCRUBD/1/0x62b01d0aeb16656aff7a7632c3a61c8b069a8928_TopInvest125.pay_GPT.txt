                  but neither matches the specific patterns described.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['dep.depositor.send(dep.expect)', 'dep.depositor.send(money)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - dep.depositor.send(dep.expect) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains '.send('
        keyword, which satisfies the second characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - dep.depositor.send(money) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains '.send('
        keyword, which satisfies the second characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
