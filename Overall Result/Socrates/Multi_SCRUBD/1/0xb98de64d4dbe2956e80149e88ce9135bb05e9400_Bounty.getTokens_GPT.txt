    Check direct function security
        - function Bounty.getTokens(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code snippet provided does not include any checks or assertions involving the msg.sender address being equal or not equal to an owner, leader, or
          similar privileged address role as described in the characteristics. It mainly requires the beneficiary is not the zero address, and the purchase is valid.
        - function Bounty.getTokens(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures like setting a boolean variable to false, requiring it to be true, setting it to true, or
          handling with an if/throw pattern. It checks a condition for the beneficiary address being non-zero and calls a function validPurchase. The function works with
          transferring tokens and emitting an event, without interacting with any of the specified boolean variable patterns.

    Analyze External Address
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            Yes 1. The function named 'Bounty' matches the contract name 'Bounty', indicating that it is a constructor. Constructors in Solidity prior to version 0.4.22
            are functions with the same name as the contract. 2. The state variable 'token' is not hardcoded within the function, as it assigns the state variable 'token'
            to a value passed as an argument '_tokenAddress', thus it is not hardcoded. Since the function satisfies the first characteristic, the answer is 'Yes'.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
