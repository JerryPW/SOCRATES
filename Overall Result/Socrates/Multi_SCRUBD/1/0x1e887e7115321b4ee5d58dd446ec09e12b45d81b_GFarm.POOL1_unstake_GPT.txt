    There are no modifiers should be examined in function POOL1_unstake.
    Check direct function security
        - function GFarm.POOL1_unstake(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The given function does not have any of the required structures involving 'msg.sender' directly comparing to 'xxxOwner', 'xxxAddress', 'Leader', or
          'CEO'. It has operations using 'msg.sender' but none matching the specified conditions.
        - function GFarm.POOL1_unstake(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code doesn't fulfill any of the required structures because it does not check for a boolean condition and subsequently change the same boolean as
          specified.

        There are ['lp'] should be checked in variable lp
        Checked variables: lp
            No The function is named 'set_LP' and is not a constructor, as its name does not match the contract name 'GFarm', nor is it explicitly named 'constructor'.
            The function does not hardcode the state variable 'lp'; instead, it updates 'lp' to a new value passed as an argument '_lp'. Therefore, the function does not
            satisfy any of the specified characteristics.
            Function Security Analysis for GFarm.set_LP(address)
                The modifier of function set_LP are ['onlyGov']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyGov is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The code in the modifier uses the 'require' statement to ensure that the function can only be executed by the 'GOVERNANCE' address. This
                      directly falls under rule 1, as it restricts access to a specific address ('GOVERNANCE'). The structure does not exhibit characteristics of lock
                      operations required by rule 2. There is no omission in the judgment based on the code provided.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _POOL1_harvest.
    Check direct function security
        - function GFarm._POOL1_harvest(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not include any condition or assert statement related to checking, comparing, or validating 'msg.sender' against any 'xxxOwner',
          'xxxAddress', 'Leader', or 'CEO'. The function logic revolves around processing rewards and referrals but does not include access control using 'msg.sender'.
        - function GFarm._POOL1_harvest(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specific structures as described in the provided characteristics.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

            There are no modifiers should be examined in function POOL1_harvest.
            Check direct function security
                - function GFarm.POOL1_harvest() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code only checks for the block number, it doesn't check or require the msg.sender to be an owner or specific address role like
                  Owner/Leader/CEO.
                - function GFarm.POOL1_harvest() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures. It contains a require statement checking block.number against POOLS_START, but this
                  does not follow the patterns described, as it does not directly manipulate a boolean variable associated with the require statement.

        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            No The provided code contains a function named 'set_TOKEN', which is not a constructor. This is determined because the function name does not match the
            contract name 'GFarm', nor is the function explicitly named 'constructor'. Additionally, the state variable 'token' is not hardcoded. The function allows the
            state variable 'token' to be set to a new value passed as a parameter '_token'.
            Function Security Analysis for GFarm.set_TOKEN(address)
                The modifier of function set_TOKEN are ['onlyGov']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyGov is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The code uses 'require(msg.sender == GOVERNANCE);' to ensure only the GOVERNANCE address can execute the function. This directly matches
                      rule 1 as it enforces that only a specific address can execute. There is no structural omission as this is the correct and only judgment needed to
                      match the required rule.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

          Reason: The function does not utilize 'msg.sender' at all, so none of the specified structures involving 'msg.sender' are present.
        - function GFarm.POOL1_update() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: None of the structures defined in the task are present in the code.

            Check direct function security
                - function GFarm.POOL1_harvest() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The given code does not include any checks involving `msg.sender` against a specific owner, address, or role such as xxxOwner, xxxAddress,
                  Leader, or CEO, as per the listed characteristics. It checks only whether the block number has reached POOLS_START before proceeding to execute
                  _POOL1_harvest with msg.sender as an argument.
                - function GFarm.POOL1_harvest() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not have any of the specified structures that involve changing a boolean variable's state after a condition check or exception

    Analyze External Address
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            No The provided code is not a constructor because the function name 'set_TOKEN' does not match the contract name 'GFarm' and is not explicitly called
            'constructor'. Additionally, the function does not have a hardcoded state variable as the variable 'token' is set based on an external input '_token' rather
            than a specific hardcoded value. Thus, the function does not satisfy any of the given characteristics.
            Function Security Analysis for GFarm.set_TOKEN(address)
                The modifier of function set_TOKEN are ['onlyGov']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyGov is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: Upon reviewing the modifier again, the code uses a require statement to enforce that only the address stored in GOVERNANCE can execute the
                      function. This matches characteristic 1 of checking whether the function allows only the owner or specific addresses to execute it.
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            No 1. The function provided is named 'set_TOKEN', which does not match the contract name (GFarm) and is not explicitly named 'constructor'. Therefore, it does
            not satisfy the constructor characteristic.  2. The function 'set_TOKEN' does not hardcode the state variable 'token'. Instead, it sets the 'token' state
            variable to the address provided as the '_token' argument, which is determined at runtime rather than being a hardcoded value. Additionally, there is a
            condition that checks whether 'token' is already set, suggesting that 'token' should initially be zero (GFarmTokenInterface(0)), but this is not inherently
            the same as hardcoding the variable 'token' in the function itself.
            Function Security Analysis for GFarm.set_TOKEN(address)
                The modifier of function set_TOKEN are ['onlyGov']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyGov is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The modifier 'onlyGov' contains the statement 'require(msg.sender == GOVERNANCE);', which matches rule 1 by enforcing that only the address
                      in the 'GOVERNANCE' variable can execute the function. No other relevant structural elements are omitted.
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            No The function 'set_TOKEN' does not match the contract name 'GFarm', nor is it explicitly named 'constructor'. Therefore, it is not a constructor.
            Additionally, the function does not hardcode the state variable 'token'; instead, it sets it to the value of the '_token' parameter. Thus, it does not satisfy
            either of the given characteristics.
            Function Security Analysis for GFarm.set_TOKEN(address)
                The modifier of function set_TOKEN are ['onlyGov']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyGov is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The code in the modifier enforces that only the GOVERNANCE address can execute the function, as seen in the statement 'require(msg.sender ==
                      GOVERNANCE);'. This satisfies characteristic 1.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

    There are no modifiers should be examined in function POOLS_safeTokenTransfer.
    Check direct function security
        - function GFarm.POOLS_safeTokenTransfer(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code provided does not include checks or assertions related to msg.sender matching specific roles such as owner, address, leader, or CEO.
        - function GFarm.POOLS_safeTokenTransfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given function, 'POOLS_safeTokenTransfer', doesn't explicitly utilize a 'require' statement to check a condition and then subsequently alter it. It
          lacks the specific structural pattern outlined for conditions and state changes around a variable named 'xxx'. Hence, none of the specified characteristics are
          satisfied.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

                  msg.sender.
                - function GFarm.POOL2_harvest() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not have any of the specific patterns mentioned: it does not set a variable to True or False after checking a condition with

    Analyze External Address
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            No The function provided is 'set_TOKEN', which is not named after the contract name 'GFarm', nor is it explicitly named 'constructor'. Thus, it is not a
            constructor.   Additionally, this function does not appear to hardcode any state variables directly within the function. It takes an external input '_token'
            to set the state variable 'token', which means the value is not hardcoded into the contract. Therefore, it does not meet the second characteristic either.
            Since the function does not meet any of the specified characteristics, the answer is 'No'.
            Function Security Analysis for GFarm.set_TOKEN(address)
                The modifier of function set_TOKEN are ['onlyGov']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyGov is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The code uses 'require(msg.sender == GOVERNANCE);' to ensure that only the specific address (GOVERNANCE) can execute the function. This
                      strictly follows characteristic 1, which checks if the function is restricted to specific addresses using require(). There is no mention of lock
                      operations, so characteristic 2 does not apply. The structure is complete and not omitted.
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            No The function 'set_TOKEN' is not a constructor because its name does not match the contract name 'GFarm' and it is not explicitly labeled as 'constructor'.
            Additionally, the function does not have a hardcoded state variable 'token'; instead, it allows for setting the 'token' state variable to a new address
            provided as a parameter, '_token'. The check `require(token == GFarmTokenInterface(0), "Token address already set")` only ensures that the 'token' is set
            once, but it does not hardcode a specific address.
            Function Security Analysis for GFarm.set_TOKEN(address)
                The modifier of function set_TOKEN are ['onlyGov']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyGov is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The modifier `onlyGov` contains the statement `require(msg.sender == GOVERNANCE);`, which checks if the caller is the specific address
                      `GOVERNANCE`. This enforces that only the specified address can execute the function, satisfying characteristic 1.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
