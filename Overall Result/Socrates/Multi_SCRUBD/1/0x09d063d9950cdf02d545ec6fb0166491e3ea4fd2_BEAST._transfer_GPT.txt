Function Security Analysis for BEAST._transfer(address,address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _transfer.
    Check direct function security
        - function BEAST._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code includes the condition 'if (msg.sender != pair && !inSwapAndLiquify && swapAndLiquifyEnabled && _balances[address(this)] >= swapThreshold)'
          which does not match the patterns specified.
        - function BEAST._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon reevaluating, the code includes a statement 'require(!bots[sender] && !bots[recipient]);' which corresponds to checking a condition. However, the
          second part of setting 'bots' to true does not appear immediately after the require statement or elsewhere in the function. Therefore, it does not fully satisfy
          any of the specified structures, as both statements in the structure must be present to consider it a match.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transfer', 'transferFrom']
        Function Security Analysis for BEAST.transfer(address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transfer.
            Check direct function security
                - function BEAST.transfer(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function 'transfer' does not check the identity of the caller against an owner or a specific address using 'require', 'if', or 'assert'. It
                  simply performs a transfer with the given 'msg.sender'.
                - function BEAST.transfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided function does not contain any of the specified structures involving the 'require' statement or variable assignments in the specific
                  order required by the conditions.

    Analyze Gas
        - bensRevival.setShare(sender,_balances[sender]) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - bensRevival.setShare(recipient,_balances[recipient]) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['bensRevival.setShare(sender,_balances[sender])', 'bensRevival.setShare(recipient,_balances[recipient])']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['bensRevival'] should be checked in variable bensRevival
        Checked variables: bensRevival
            Yes 1. The function is a constructor as it is explicitly named 'constructor'. Constructors are special functions that are executed at contract deployment and
            have the same name as the contract in older versions of Solidity or explicitly called 'constructor' in newer versions. This function sets up initial values,
            validations, and configurations required once the contract is deployed.  2. The constructor does not hardcode the state variable 'bensRevival'. Instead, it
            assigns a new instance of the BensRevival contract to it.
        There are ['bensRevival'] should be checked in variable bensRevival
        Checked variables: bensRevival
            Yes The function is named 'constructor', which explicitly indicates that this function is a constructor of the contract. Hence, it satisfies the first
            characteristic for an external call function.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: BEAST.swapBack()
Function Security Analysis for BEAST.swapBack()
    The modifier of function swapBack are ['lockTheSwap']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier lockTheSwap is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The code snippet in the modifier correctly implements both the lock and unlock operations by setting `inSwapAndLiquify` to `true` at the beginning and
          resetting it to `false` at the end. This ensures the function enters only once.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
