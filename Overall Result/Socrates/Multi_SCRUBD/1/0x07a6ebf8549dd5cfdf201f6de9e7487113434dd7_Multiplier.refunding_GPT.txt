Function Security Analysis for Multiplier.refunding()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function refunding.
    Check direct function security
        - function Multiplier.refunding() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any checks on msg.sender, such as require, assert, or if conditions, to determine if msg.sender is a specific owner,
          address, Leader, or CEO.
        - function Multiplier.refunding() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not contain any of the specified structures such as 'require(xxx == True)', 'require(xxx == False)', or 'if(!xxx) throw', combined
          with subsequent assignments to the variable 'xxx'. Therefore, it does not satisfy any of the conditions outlined.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['fallback']
        Function Security Analysis for Multiplier.fallback()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
            Check direct function security
                - function Multiplier.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified characteristics that involve checking if `msg.sender` corresponds to an owner/authorized account
                  using require, if conditions, or assert.
                - function Multiplier.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: Upon reviewing the code again, the structure `require(!isContract(msg.sender));` is present. However, the second part of the check, which would
                  be setting `isContract` to `True` after the require statement, is not present. The function does not alter the `isContract` variable or any comparable
                  one afterwards, hence it does not fully match the required structure. None of the statements adjust the value of `isContract` or create a similar effect
                  with another variable after the initial `require` check.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['dep.depositor.send(refund)', 'dep.depositor.send(amount)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - dep.depositor.send(refund) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call contains the '.send(' keyword..
        Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - dep.depositor.send(amount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call contains the '.send(' keyword..
        Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
