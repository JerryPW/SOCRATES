Function Security Analysis for CoinMerge._disperseEth()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _disperseEth.
    Check direct function security
        - function CoinMerge._disperseEth() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any explicit 'require', 'if', 'assert', or 'throw' statements involving the conditions of the function caller with msg.sender
          related to authorization checks against any kind of owner or leader roles.
        - function CoinMerge._disperseEth() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any require statements or if conditions checking boolean variables with specific conditions such as `require(xxx ==
          True);`, `require(xxx == False);`, `require(!xxx);`, or `if(!xxx) throw`, followed by a variable assignment of the opposite boolean value. Hence, this code does
          not match any of the specified structures.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transfer', 'transferFrom', '_tax', '_transfer']
        Function Security Analysis for CoinMerge.transfer(address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transfer.
            Check direct function security
                - function CoinMerge.transfer(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The provided function does not have any 'require', 'if', or 'assert' statements checking against msg.sender to verify it matches
                  xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
                - function CoinMerge.transfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not include any 'require' clauses or if-conditions that align with the specified patterns involving a boolean parameter that
                  toggles between true and false. It lacks a boolean variable manipulation as required by the structures provided.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['External.deposit(_devBalance)', 'm_ProjectWallet.transfer(_projectBalance)', 'address(address(External)).transfer(_devBalance)',
    'address(address(EthReflect)).transfer(_redistBalance)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - m_ProjectWallet.transfer(_projectBalance) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains
        the '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - address(address(External)).transfer(_devBalance) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        contains the '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - address(address(EthReflect)).transfer(_redistBalance) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external
        call contains the '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - External.deposit(_devBalance) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['External.deposit(_devBalance)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['External'] should be checked in variable External
        Checked variables: External
            Yes The provided external code is a constructor because the function is explicitly named 'constructor'.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
