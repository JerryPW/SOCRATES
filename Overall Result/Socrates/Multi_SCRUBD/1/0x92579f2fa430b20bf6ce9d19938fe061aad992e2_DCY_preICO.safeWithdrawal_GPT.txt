Function Security Analysis for DCY_preICO.safeWithdrawal()
    The modifier of function safeWithdrawal are ['afterDeadline']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier afterDeadline has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier 'afterDeadline' does not explicitly enforce ownership or authorized addresses, nor does it implement a locking mechanism as described in
          the characteristics. It simply checks if the current time is after a specified deadline.
    Check direct function security
        - function DCY_preICO.safeWithdrawal() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code never uses 'msg.sender' in relation to xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO directly. The check 'beneficiary == msg.sender' does not pertain to
          any of these roles explicitly as defined by the required patterns.
        - function DCY_preICO.safeWithdrawal() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon reviewing the function code, there is no explicit 'require(!fundingGoalReached); fundingGoalReached = true;' pattern or any of the other specified
          patterns present in the code. The closest logic statements involve conditional checks and assignments, but none match the required pattern of checking a
          condition and then forcibly changing it. Thus, the necessary dual statements for pattern matching are not fulfilled.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['msg.sender.send(amount)', 'beneficiary.send(amountRaised)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - msg.sender.send(amount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains '.send(' keyword,
        hence it satisfies the characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - beneficiary.send(amountRaised) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains '.send('
        keyword, hence it satisfies the characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
