Function Security Analysis for MessierAnonymity.sendRewardtoPool()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function sendRewardtoPool.
    Check direct function security
        - function MessierAnonymity.sendRewardtoPool() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code in the provided function does not include any require, assert, or if statement checking msg.sender against roles like
          xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
        - function MessierAnonymity.sendRewardtoPool() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures, such as require statements or if conditions that include setting the same variable to true or
          false.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['deposit', 'withdraw']
        Function Security Analysis for MessierAnonymity.deposit(bytes32)
            The modifier of function deposit are ['nonReentrant']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier nonReentrant is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The code in the modifier uses a counter (_guardCounter) to implement a locking mechanism. It increments the counter and checks it after the
                  function execution to ensure reentrancy is prevented. This matches the criterion for a lock operation, which requires setting a flag before execution
                  and checking/resetting it afterward, satisfying rule 2. Both lock and unlock operations are identified here.
        Function Security Analysis for MessierAnonymity.withdraw(bytes,bytes32,bytes32,address,address,uint256,uint256)
            The modifier of function withdraw are ['nonReentrant']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier nonReentrant is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The modifier uses a counter to implement a reentrancy guard. It sets the counter at the start and checks the counter after executing the
                  function body to ensure it's not re-entered. This matches the lock and unlock operations required in rule 2.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
