    Analyze Transfer
        - ERC20(externalTokensForHolder[i]).transfer(holder,_townHoldersLedger[holder][externalTokensForHolder[i]]) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in

    Analyze Gas
        - ERC20(externalTokensForHolder[i]).transfer(holder,_townHoldersLedger[holder][externalTokensForHolder[i]]) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['ERC20(externalTokensForHolder[i]).transfer(holder,_townHoldersLedger[holder][externalTokensForHolder[i]])']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['_ledgerExternalTokensAddresses'] should be checked in variable externalTokensForHolder
        Checked variables: _ledgerExternalTokensAddresses
            Yes 1. The provided external functions are named 'distributionSnapshot' and 'claimExternalTokens'. The contract name is 'Town'. None of these functions match
            the contract name nor are they explicitly named 'constructor', indicating they are not constructors.  2. The state variable provided is
            '_ledgerExternalTokensAddresses'. The provided code does indeed access and modify this state variable. Specifically, within the 'claimExternalTokens'
            function, the code deletes the elements related to an 'holder' from the '_ledgerExternalTokensAddresses' mapping or array. Similarly, the
            'distributionSnapshot' function accesses '_ledgerExternalTokensAddresses' to push an external token address if certain conditions are met, indicating direct
            modification of this state variable.  Given that the functions directly manipulate the '_ledgerExternalTokensAddresses' state variable, they satisfy the
            second condition.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
