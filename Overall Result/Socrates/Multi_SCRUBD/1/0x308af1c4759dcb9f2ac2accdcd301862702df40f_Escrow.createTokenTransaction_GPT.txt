    The modifier of function createTokenTransaction are ['onlyAllowed']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier onlyAllowed is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The code explicitly uses 'require' to ensure that 'msg.sender' is either 'owner' or an address returned by 'eternal.getAddress(0)'. This matches
          characteristic 1, as it enforces execution restriction to specific addresses. No evidence of lock operations were found that align with characteristic 2.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
