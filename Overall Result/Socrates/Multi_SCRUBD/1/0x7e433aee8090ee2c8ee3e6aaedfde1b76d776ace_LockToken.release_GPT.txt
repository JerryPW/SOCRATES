Function Security Analysis for LockToken.release()
    The modifier of function release are ['onlyOwner']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: Upon reviewing the modifier 'onlyOwner', it uses 'require(msg.sender == owner);', which ensures that only the owner can execute the function. This
          matches the first characteristic that checks for code enforcing execution by specific addresses, specifically the owner in this case. There are no structural
          omissions in this respect. However, there is no evidence of a lock operation present in this modifier, hence it does not satisfy the second characteristic.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
