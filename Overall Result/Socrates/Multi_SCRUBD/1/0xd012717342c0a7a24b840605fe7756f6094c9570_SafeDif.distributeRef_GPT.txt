    There are no modifiers should be examined in function distributeRef.
    Check direct function security
        - function SafeDif.distributeRef(uint256,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The provided function does not contain any of the specified structural patterns. It does not perform checks or conditionals related to 'msg.sender ==
          xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO', 'msg.sender != xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO', or assertions related to 'msg.sender'.
        - function SafeDif.distributeRef(uint256,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any require statements or any usage of boolean variables to check conditions similar to the described
          characteristics. It performs calculations and transfers without any conditional checks using boolean variables.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

        Function Security Analysis for SafeDif.invest(uint256,uint256)
            The modifier of function invest are ['isActivated']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier isActivated has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The given modifier `isActivated` does not enforce any owner or specific address checks (rule 1), nor does it implement a lock mechanism to
                  ensure the function enters only once (rule 2). The modifier name `isActivated` also doesn't suggest ownership or reentrancy protection (rule 3).
            Check direct function security
                - function SafeDif.invest(uint256,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain any 'require', 'if', or 'assert' statements involving a comparison of 'msg.sender' with
                  'xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO'.
                - function SafeDif.invest(uint256,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the required structures as it lacks specific require statements that directly manipulate variables in the way
                  described.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['player_[_affID2].addr.transfer(_aff)', 'player_[_affID1].addr.transfer(_aff)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - player_[_affID2].addr.transfer(_aff) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the
        '.transfer(' keyword, which matches the first rule.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - player_[_affID1].addr.transfer(_aff) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the
        '.transfer(' keyword, which matches the first rule.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
