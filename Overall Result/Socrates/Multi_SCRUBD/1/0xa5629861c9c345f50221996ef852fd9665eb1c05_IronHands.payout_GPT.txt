Function Security Analysis for IronHands.payout()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function payout.
    Check direct function security
        - function IronHands.payout() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any require, if, or assert statements checking that msg.sender is equal or not equal to an ownership or leadership address
          identifier such as xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO.
        - function IronHands.payout() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not involve the "require" statements or conditional logics that operate on boolean variables as per the structures defined. The single use
          of require is to check if the balance is greater than 1, which does not match any of the specified patterns involving boolean variables.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.call.value(payoutToSend).gas(1000000)()', 'weak_hands.buy.value(investment).gas(1000000)(msg.sender)']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - The gas limit in participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.call.value(payoutToSend).gas(1000000)() is 1000000, which is too high. Therefore, it will not prevent
        REE problem.
        - The gas limit in weak_hands.buy.value(investment).gas(1000000)(msg.sender) is 1000000, which is too high. Therefore, it will not prevent REE problem.
    Remaining external call: ['participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.call.value(payoutToSend).gas(1000000)()',
    'weak_hands.buy.value(investment).gas(1000000)(msg.sender)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['participants'] should be checked in variable participants
        Checked variables: participants
            No Neither the 'deposit' nor 'payout' function matches the given contract name 'IronHands' nor are they explicitly named 'constructor', indicating that they
            are not constructors. Furthermore, neither of the functions has hardcoded the 'participants' state variable within its code.
            Function Security Analysis for IronHands.deposit()
                The modifier of function deposit are ['limitBuy']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier limitBuy has no relation with controlled by owner.
                      Reason: The code in the modifier does not enforce that only the owner or specific addresses can execute the function, nor does it use a lock
                      operation or possess a function name that suggests it limits access based on ownership or reentrancy protection.
                Check direct function security
                    - function IronHands.deposit() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                      Reason: The code does not include any require, if, or assert statements checking the identity of msg.sender against a specific owner, address, or
                      roles like Leader or CEO.
                    - function IronHands.deposit() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                      Reason: The function does not have any of the specified structures. It contains a require statement, but this is related to checking msg.value
                      rather than following a specific pattern of setting and checking a boolean variable.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
