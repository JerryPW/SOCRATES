    There are no modifiers should be examined in function transfer.
    Check direct function security
        - function VestingContractWT.transfer(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any 'require', 'if', or 'assert' statements that involve checking 'msg.sender' against an entity such as 'xxxOwner',
          'xxxAddress', 'Leader', or 'CEO'.
        - function VestingContractWT.transfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code snippet checks certain conditions using a require statement, but does not modify any flagged variable immediately following it, as
          specified by the defined structures.

        There are ['we_token'] should be checked in variable we_token
        Checked variables: we_token
            Yes The provided function name 'VestingContractWT' matches the contract name 'VestingContractWT', which indicates that this function is a constructor.
            Constructors are identified by having the same name as the contract in older versions of Solidity (prior to 0.4.22) or by being explicitly named
            'constructor'.
        There are ['we_token'] should be checked in variable we_token
        Checked variables: we_token
            Yes The function name matches the contract name 'VestingContractWT', indicating it is a constructor for the contract. Constructors have special properties,
            different from regular functions, such as executing only once at contract deployment.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
