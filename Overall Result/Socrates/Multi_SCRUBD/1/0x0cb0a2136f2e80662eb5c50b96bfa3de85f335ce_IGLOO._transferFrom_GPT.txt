    Check direct function security
        - function IGLOO._transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures for checking the `msg.sender`. The checks involving `msg.sender` do not include any
          of the specific roles such as Owner, Address, Leader, or CEO.
        - function IGLOO._transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures listed in the prompt. It mainly involves operations related to token transfer and
          balance checking without explicitly flipping a boolean variable as required in the structured criteria.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transferFrom', 'transfer']
        Function Security Analysis for IGLOO.transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transferFrom.
            Check direct function security
                - function IGLOO.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The given code does not contain any condition that directly checks if msg.sender is equal or not equal to any Owner/Address/Leader/CEO role.
                - function IGLOO.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not match any of the specific patterns mentioned. It uses a require statement to check for sufficient allowance, but it doesn't
                  appear to adjust a boolean variable as specified in patterns 1-4. There's neither a change from True to False nor from False to True as specified.

Start analyze function: IGLOO._payTreasury()
Function Security Analysis for IGLOO._payTreasury()
    The modifier of function _payTreasury are ['swapping']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier swapping is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The code contains both the lock ('_swapping = true;') and unlock ('_swapping = false;') operations. These are used to set a flag ensuring the function
          enters only once, fulfilling the requirement for structural characteristic 2.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
