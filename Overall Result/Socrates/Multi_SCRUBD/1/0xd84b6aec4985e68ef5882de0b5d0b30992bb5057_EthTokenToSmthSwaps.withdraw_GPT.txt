Function Security Analysis for EthTokenToSmthSwaps.withdraw(bytes32,address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function withdraw.
    Check direct function security
        - function EthTokenToSmthSwaps.withdraw(bytes32,address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The provided code does not include any of the specified structures such as require, if, or assert statements involving msg.sender with a specified
          address or role.
        - function EthTokenToSmthSwaps.withdraw(bytes32,address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures with a 'require' statement that toggles the boolean value of the same variable before and
          after. It is focused on checking conditions and updating the swap status, but without the toggle behavior on a binary variable.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['ERC20(swap.token).transfer(swap.targetWallet,swap.balance)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - ERC20(swap.token).transfer(swap.targetWallet,swap.balance) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - ERC20(swap.token).transfer(swap.targetWallet,swap.balance) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['ERC20(swap.token).transfer(swap.targetWallet,swap.balance)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['swaps'] should be checked in variable swap
        Checked variables: swaps
            No None of the provided functions are constructors, as they neither match the contract name 'EthTokenToSmthSwaps' nor are explicitly named 'constructor'.
            Additionally, the state variable 'swaps' is not hardcoded in any meaningful way in the functions. It is used as a normal state variable, being read or set
            dynamically, not hardcoded to constant values.
            Function Security Analysis for EthTokenToSmthSwaps.createSwap(bytes20,address,uint256,address)
                There are no modifiers should be examined in function createSwap.
                Check direct function security
                    - function EthTokenToSmthSwaps.createSwap(bytes20,address,uint256,address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                      Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures that check the identity of msg.sender against a specific owner, leader, or
                      address. Instead, it performs operations with checks on _value, swap balance, and token transfer.
                    - function EthTokenToSmthSwaps.createSwap(bytes20,address,uint256,address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                      Reason: The function doesn't have a structure matching any of the specified patterns. No 'require' statements compare a variable to 'true' or
                      'false', nor are there any variable assignments following such a required condition or thrown exception compared to false.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
