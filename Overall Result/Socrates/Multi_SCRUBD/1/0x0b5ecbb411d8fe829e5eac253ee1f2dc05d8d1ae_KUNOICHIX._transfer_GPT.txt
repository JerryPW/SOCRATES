    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _transfer.
    Check direct function security
        - function KUNOICHIX._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not include any direct or indirect access control using msg.sender for address ownership or role-based access. The only owner-related
          logic involves comparisons between 'from' and 'to' addresses against 'owner()' or other contract-specific addresses, but not 'msg.sender'. This does not fit the
          specified characteristics.
        - function KUNOICHIX._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code doesn't match any of the structures stipulated. Specifically, it does not contain a 'require' statement accompanied by the exact sequence of
          changing a boolean variable as outlined. The function contains several 'require' statements and manipulations of boolean values like 'takeFee',
          'buyOrSellSwitch', but none that exactly match the required patterns.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transfer', 'transferFrom']
        Function Security Analysis for KUNOICHIX.transfer(address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transfer.
            Check direct function security
                - function KUNOICHIX.transfer(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code doesn't include any checks that restrict actions based on msg.sender being an owner, address, Leader, or CEO, as defined in the
                  specified structures.
                - function KUNOICHIX.transfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code is a basic function facilitating transfers and does not contain any 'require' or 'if' conditions related to setting or checking a
                  variable as described in the specified structures.

Start analyze function: KUNOICHIX.swapBack()
Function Security Analysis for KUNOICHIX.swapBack()
    The modifier of function swapBack are ['lockTheSwap']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier lockTheSwap is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: Upon reviewing the code, the modifier 'lockTheSwap' does set 'inSwapAndLiquify' to true at the beginning and then resets it to false at the end of the
          function execution. This lock and unlock operation meets the criteria for rule 2, as both operations are present and correctly structured. Thus, the initial
          judgment remains correct.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
