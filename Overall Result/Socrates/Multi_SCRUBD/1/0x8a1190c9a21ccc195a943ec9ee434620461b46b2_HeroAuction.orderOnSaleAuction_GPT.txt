    Check direct function security
        - function HeroAuction.orderOnSaleAuction(uint256,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any owner-oriented checks on msg.sender for controlling access.
        - function HeroAuction.orderOnSaleAuction(uint256,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: None of the specified code structures are present. The code contains 'require' statements and other logic, but does not match any of the listed
          patterns.

    Analyze External Address
        There are ['saleAuction'] should be checked in variable saleAuction
        Checked variables: saleAuction
            No 1. The function given is not a constructor, as its name 'setSaleAuctionAddress' does not match the contract name 'HeroAuction', nor is it named
            'constructor'.  2. The function updates the state variable 'saleAuction' with the input '_address', which is not hardcoded. It is dynamically set based on the
            input parameter 'address _address'.  Therefore, neither condition is satisfied in this function.
            Function Security Analysis for HeroAuction.setSaleAuctionAddress(address)
                The modifier of function setSaleAuctionAddress are ['onlyLeader']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyLeader is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The code includes a require statement that checks if msg.sender is equal to leaderAddress, fulfilling rule 1, which requires that the
                      function enforces only the owner or a specific address can execute it. There are no omissions in structure 1, and structure 2 is not relevant here.
        There are ['saleAuction'] should be checked in variable saleAuction
        Checked variables: saleAuction
            No The provided function `setSaleAuctionAddress` is not a constructor since its name does not match the contract name `HeroAuction` nor is it explicitly named
            'constructor'. Additionally, the function uses a parameter `_address` to set the `saleAuction` state variable, which means it is not hardcoded.
            Function Security Analysis for HeroAuction.setSaleAuctionAddress(address)
                The modifier of function setSaleAuctionAddress are ['onlyLeader']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyLeader is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The code contains 'require(msg.sender == leaderAddress);', which directly matches rule 1, enforcing that only the specific address
                      'leaderAddress' can execute the function. There are no omissions or structural issues regarding this requirement.
        There are ['saleAuction'] should be checked in variable saleAuction
        Checked variables: saleAuction
            No The function `setSaleAuctionAddress` does not have the same name as the contract name `HeroAuction`, nor is it explicitly named 'constructor'. Thus, it is
            not a constructor. Additionally, the function sets the state variable `saleAuction` using a parameter `_address` and not a hardcoded value. Therefore, it does
            not satisfy either characteristic.
            Function Security Analysis for HeroAuction.setSaleAuctionAddress(address)
                The modifier of function setSaleAuctionAddress are ['onlyLeader']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyLeader is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: Rechecking the provided modifier code, the statement 'require(msg.sender == leaderAddress);' is present, confirming the enforcement that
                      only the address stored in 'leaderAddress' can execute the function. There are no structural omissions, as this fully satisfies Rule 1 of requiring
                      control by specific addresses. Rule 2 does not apply here because there's no lock operation present in this code.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
