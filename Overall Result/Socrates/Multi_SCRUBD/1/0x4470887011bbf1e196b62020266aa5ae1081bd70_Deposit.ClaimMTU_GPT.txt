Function Security Analysis for Deposit.ClaimMTU(bool)
    The modifier of function ClaimMTU are ['paused']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier paused has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: None of the specified characteristics are present in the code. Specifically, there is no check for ownership or specific address permissions, no lock
          operation present, and the function name 'paused' does not imply ownership or reentrancy prevention.
    Check direct function security
        - function Deposit.ClaimMTU(bool) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not include any checks or assertions based on the msg.sender being equal or not equal to specific addresses like xxxOwner, xxxAddress,
          Leader, or CEO.
        - function Deposit.ClaimMTU(bool) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided function does not contain any of the specified code structures where a variable is required to be either true or false and then has its
          value changed as described in conditions 1 to 4.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['tokenTransfer.transfer(msg.sender,claimTokens)', 'getAddress(team).transfer(ethVal/20)', 'msg.sender.transfer(ethVal)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - tokenTransfer.transfer(msg.sender,claimTokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - getAddress(team).transfer(ethVal/20) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call contains '.transfer('
        keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - msg.sender.transfer(ethVal) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call contains '.transfer(' keyword..
        Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - tokenTransfer.transfer(msg.sender,claimTokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['tokenTransfer.transfer(msg.sender,claimTokens)']
    Analyze External Address
        The variable 'tokenTransfer' in external call 'tokenTransfer.transfer(msg.sender,claimTokens)' has no state variable assigned in Deposit.ClaimMTU(bool). Therefore
        we check whether it has been hardcoded in the function.
            No The variable 'tokenTransfer' is declared as an instance of a token contract using the address obtained from getAddress("unit"). It is not hardcoded as the
            actual address is dynamically retrieved from a function call and can vary based on the implementation of getAddress.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
