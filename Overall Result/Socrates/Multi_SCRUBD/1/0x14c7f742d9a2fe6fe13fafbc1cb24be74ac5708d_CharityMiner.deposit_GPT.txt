Function Security Analysis for CharityMiner.deposit(uint8)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function deposit.
    Check direct function security
        - function CharityMiner.deposit(uint8) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified patterns related to msg.sender such as require, if, or assert statements directly checking msg.sender
          against predefined addresses or roles like xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
        - function CharityMiner.deposit(uint8) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code contains the statement 'require(!paused);', but it does not follow up immediately with the assignment 'paused = True;'. Therefore, none of the
          listed structures are present in the code.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['charityAddress.transfer(donation)', 'p3d.withdraw()', 'p3d.buy.value(purchase)(msg.sender)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - charityAddress.transfer(donation) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains
        '.transfer(', which satisfies the condition for a transfer call.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - p3d.withdraw() ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - p3d.buy.value(purchase)(msg.sender) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['p3d.withdraw()', 'p3d.buy.value(purchase)(msg.sender)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['p3d'] should be checked in variable p3d
        Checked variables: p3d
            Yes The provided code is a constructor because the function is explicitly named 'constructor', indicating it is a special type of function that initializes
            the contract. This fulfills the first characteristic.
        There are ['p3d'] should be checked in variable p3d
        Checked variables: p3d
            Yes The function in the provided code is named 'constructor', explicitly indicating it is a constructor function. Constructors are special functions in
            Solidity that are used for initializing the contract state during deployment. Thus, this code satisfies the first characteristic as the function's name is
            'constructor'.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: CharityMiner.myTokens()
Function Security Analysis for CharityMiner.myTokens()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function myTokens.
    Check direct function security
        - function CharityMiner.myTokens() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not perform any checks related to msg.sender and does not match any of the provided structures.
        - function CharityMiner.myTokens() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures as it is a simple function returning the result of another function call
          (p3d.myTokens()). It lacks require statements or if statements as described in the characteristic structures.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['p3d.myTokens()']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - p3d.myTokens() ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['p3d.myTokens()']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['p3d'] should be checked in variable p3d
        Checked variables: p3d
            Yes The function is explicitly named 'constructor', indicating that it is a constructor function for the contract. Constructor functions are special functions
            in smart contracts that are only executed once when the contract is deployed. Thus, the code satisfies the first characteristic.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: CharityMiner.myDividends()
Function Security Analysis for CharityMiner.myDividends()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function myDividends.
    Check direct function security
        - function CharityMiner.myDividends() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The given function does not contain any access control checks as specified (e.g., require, if statements checking msg.sender, or assert statements).
          Thus, none of the characteristics are present.
        - function CharityMiner.myDividends() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function myDividends does not satisfy any of the defined structures as there are no require statements or any logical conditions manipulating a
          boolean variable.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['p3d.myDividends(true)']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - p3d.myDividends(true) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['p3d.myDividends(true)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['p3d'] should be checked in variable p3d
        Checked variables: p3d
            Yes 1. The given function is a constructor as evidenced by its name, which matches one of the characteristics of constructors in Solidity. Specifically, the
            function is explicitly named 'constructor'. This matches the second part of characteristic 1. 2. Additionally, the function initializes the state variable
            'p3d' using the passed argument 'powh', but there is no hardcoding of the 'p3d' variable in the constructor body, so it doesn't satisfy characteristic 2.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
