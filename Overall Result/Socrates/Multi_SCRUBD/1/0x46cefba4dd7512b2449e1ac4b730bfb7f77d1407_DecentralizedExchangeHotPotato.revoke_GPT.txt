Function Security Analysis for DecentralizedExchangeHotPotato.revoke(uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function revoke.
    Check direct function security
        - function DecentralizedExchangeHotPotato.revoke(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The requirement 'require(msg.sender == orderBook[_id].owner);' does not count since 'orderBook[_id].owner' is guided by the local variable 'orderBook',
          which does not match the specified structures since we are looking for static identifiers like 'xxxOwner'.
        - function DecentralizedExchangeHotPotato.revoke(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not have any conditional require statements that explicitly check if a variable is True or False, followed by assignments that toggle the
          value of the same variable.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['issuer.transfer(msg.sender,orderBook[_id].tokenId)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - issuer.transfer(msg.sender,orderBook[_id].tokenId) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - issuer.transfer(msg.sender,orderBook[_id].tokenId) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['issuer.transfer(msg.sender,orderBook[_id].tokenId)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['orderBook'] should be checked in variable issuer
        Checked variables: orderBook
            No The provided functions in the code do not appear to satisfy either of the specified characteristics. None of the function names match the contract name
            'DecentralizedExchangeHotPotato', nor are any of the functions explicitly named 'constructor', which means none of them are constructors. Additionally, there
            are no indications that any state variables are hardcoded within the functions. The 'orderBook' state variable is used dynamically; it is not hardcoded in the
            sense of being assigned a constant or fixed value within the functions. Therefore, neither characteristic is satisfied.
            Function Security Analysis for DecentralizedExchangeHotPotato.put(address,uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256)
                There are no modifiers should be examined in function put.
                Check direct function security
                    - function DecentralizedExchangeHotPotato.put(address,uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority
                    of msg.sender
                      Reason: The require statement checks if 'msg.sender' is the owner of the token through the 'issuer' local variable, which does not match any of the
                      prescribed structures irrespective of the local variable context as specified.
                    - function DecentralizedExchangeHotPotato.put(address,uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock
                    machinism.
                      Reason: The code does not meet any of the patterns specified. It has a require statement with a condition, but it does not change the variable's
                      value afterward, nor does it have the required structures following the patterns given.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
