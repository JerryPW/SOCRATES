    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier nonReentrant is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.

          function, thus preventing reentrancy. It has both a lock operation (_guardCounter += 1;) and an unlock operation (implicitly by requiring the localCounter to
          equal _guardCounter post-execution), satisfying criteria 2.
