    There are no modifiers should be examined in function remuneration.
    Check direct function security
        - function Town.remuneration(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not include any of the specified structures that check for msg.sender being a specific owner or leader address.
        - function Town.remuneration(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code provided does not include any of the specified structures. It contains multiple `require` statements but none follow the required pattern with
          assignments to a variable like in the given structures.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['_token.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),restOfTokens)', 'msg.sender.transfer(address(this).balance)',
    '_token.transferFrom(msg.sender,user,amount)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - msg.sender.transfer(address(this).balance) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: This call contains
        '.transfer(', which is one of the specified keywords.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - _token.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),restOfTokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - _token.transferFrom(msg.sender,user,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['_token.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),restOfTokens)', '_token.transferFrom(msg.sender,user,amount)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['_token'] should be checked in variable _token
        Checked variables: _token
            Yes The provided code is a constructor, as it is explicitly named 'constructor'. This matches the first characteristic for which we're checking. Therefore, it
            satisfies at least one of the given conditions. The hardcoded check for the state variable _token is not necessary, as the constructor itself is sufficient.
        There are ['_token'] should be checked in variable _token
        Checked variables: _token
            Yes The provided code is a constructor, explicitly named 'constructor'.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
