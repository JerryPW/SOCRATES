Function Security Analysis for HayReflections.distributeDividend(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function distributeDividend.
    Check direct function security
        - function HayReflections.distributeDividend(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not check the identity of msg.sender, as required by the given characteristics.
        - function HayReflections.distributeDividend(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures with 'require' or 'if'.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['setShare', 'gibTokens', 'process']
        Function Security Analysis for HayReflections.setShare(address,uint256)
            The modifier of function setShare are ['onlyToken']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyToken is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: Upon reevaluation, the modifier contains the requirement 'require(msg.sender == _token);' which checks if the sender is equal to a specific
                  address (_token). This satisfies rule 1 as it enforces that only a specific address can execute the function. No other rules are described or
                  applicable, such as any lock/unlock operations for rule 2.
        Function Security Analysis for HayReflections.gibTokens(address)
            The modifier of function gibTokens are ['onlyToken']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyToken is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The code in the modifier `onlyToken` contains the statement `require(msg.sender == _token);`. This statement enforces that only the specific
                  address `_token` can execute the function, matching characteristic 1 where the code enforces execution by only a specific address. There are no lock and
                  unlock operations present, so characteristic 2 is not matched.
        Function Security Analysis for HayReflections.process(uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function process.
            Check direct function security
                - function HayReflections.process(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The provided function does not contain any lines that involve checking if 'msg.sender' is equal to or not equal to a specific owner/leader/CEO
                  address, which is required as per the given criteria to output 'Yes'.
                - function HayReflections.process(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain the specified structures: there are no require statements or throw exceptions based on the variable state, followed by
                  setting the variable state. Hence it does not satisfy any of the required patterns.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['IERC20(HAY).transfer(shareholder,amount)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - IERC20(HAY).transfer(shareholder,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - IERC20(HAY).transfer(shareholder,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['IERC20(HAY).transfer(shareholder,amount)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['HAY'] should be checked in variable HAY
        Checked variables: HAY
            Yes The provided code is a constructor because the function is explicitly named 'constructor'. Additionally, the constructor hardcodes the state variable
            'HAY' with the value '0xfA3E941D1F6B7b10eD84A0C211bfA8aeE907965e'. Therefore, it satisfies both characteristics.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
