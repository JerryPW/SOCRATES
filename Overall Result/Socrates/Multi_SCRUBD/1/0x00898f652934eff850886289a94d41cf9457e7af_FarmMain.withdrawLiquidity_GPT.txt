Function Security Analysis for FarmMain.withdrawLiquidity(uint256,uint256,bool,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function withdrawLiquidity.
    Check direct function security
        - function FarmMain.withdrawLiquidity(uint256,uint256,bool,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function withdrawLiquidity does not contain any condition checking if msg.sender is an owner or specific address as per the given structure.
        - function FarmMain.withdrawLiquidity(uint256,uint256,bool,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code contains require statements, but none of them fit the specific structures outlined, involving setting the same variable after the require
          statement.

Start analyze function: FarmMain._burnFarmTokenAmount(uint256,uint256)
Function Security Analysis for FarmMain._burnFarmTokenAmount(uint256,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _burnFarmTokenAmount.
    Check direct function security
        - function FarmMain._burnFarmTokenAmount(uint256,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any checks or assertions involving msg.sender being compared to xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO. Thus, none of the
          specified structures are present.
        - function FarmMain._burnFarmTokenAmount(uint256,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures mentioned in the task description. It neither uses 'require' to check conditions nor
          does it manipulate boolean variables in the way described.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['withdrawLiquidity', 'unlock']
        Function Security Analysis for FarmMain.withdrawLiquidity(uint256,uint256,bool,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function withdrawLiquidity.
            Check direct function security
                - function FarmMain.withdrawLiquidity(uint256,uint256,bool,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code checks msg.sender against a property of a local struct variable (farmingPosition.uniqueOwner), which does not match the specified
                  patterns for requiring specific roles or addresses without referencing local struct properties.
                - function FarmMain.withdrawLiquidity(uint256,uint256,bool,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code doesn't contain any of the specified structures, as it does not have a 'require' or 'if' statement followed by a specific variable
                  assignment and the respective conditions outlined in the patterns.

    Analyze External Address
        There are ['_farmTokenCollection'] should be checked in variable tokenCollection
        Checked variables: _farmTokenCollection
            No 1. The smart contract function provided is named 'init', and the contract's name is 'FarmMain'. The function name does not match the contract name, nor is
            it explicitly named 'constructor'. Thus, it is not a constructor.  2. The state variable '_farmTokenCollection' is used within the function, but it is not
            hardcoded with a specific value. It is being assigned a value through the result of a function call to 'IEthItemOrchestrator(orchestrator).createNative'.
            There are no hardcoded assignments to '_farmTokenCollection'.  Since the function does not satisfy either characteristic, the response is 'No'.
            Function Security Analysis for FarmMain.init(address,bytes,address,address,bytes)
                There are no modifiers should be examined in function init.
                Check direct function security
                    - function FarmMain.init(address,bytes,address,address,bytes) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                      Reason: The function does not have any checks or logic involving 'msg.sender' in the required structures. There is no 'require', 'if', or 'assert'
                      condition involving 'msg.sender' compared to any 'xxxOwner', 'xxxAddress', 'Leader', or 'CEO' roles.
                    - function FarmMain.init(address,bytes,address,address,bytes) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                      Reason: None of the specified structures are present in the code. The code includes `require` statements but neither involves setting the required
                      variable to False/True after the `require`, nor follows the pattern with `if(!xxx) throw;`. The requires in code are about ensuring the _factory is
                      zero or extension is not zero, unrelated to changing the state of the checked variable immediately after.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
