Function Security Analysis for EthTokenToSmthSwaps.withdrawNoMoney(bytes32,address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function withdrawNoMoney.
    Check direct function security
        - function EthTokenToSmthSwaps.withdrawNoMoney(bytes32,address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not have any checks or conditions that include a structure where the code checks if msg.sender is equal or not equal to an owner or a
          specific address such as xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO.
        - function EthTokenToSmthSwaps.withdrawNoMoney(bytes32,address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not have any of the mentioned structures like 'require(xxx == True); xxx = False;', 'require(xxx == False); xxx = True;', 'require(!xxx);
          xxx = True;', or 'if(!xxx) throw; xxx = true;'. It uses 'require' statements to ensure conditions are met for proceeding with the function logic, but they do
          not alter any boolean variable in the specified manner.

    Analyze Gas
        - ERC20(swap.token).transfer(swap.targetWallet,swap.balance) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['ERC20(swap.token).transfer(swap.targetWallet,swap.balance)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['swaps'] should be checked in variable swap
        Checked variables: swaps
            No 1. None of the function names match the contract name 'EthTokenToSmthSwaps', nor is there any function explicitly named 'constructor'. Thus, none of them
            are constructors.  2. While each provided function interacts with the state variable 'swaps', none of them hardcode any specific values into it. All updates
            to 'swaps' are dynamic and based on function input parameters, rather than hardcoded values. Thus, the functions do not satisfy the second characteristic.
            Function Security Analysis for EthTokenToSmthSwaps.createSwap(bytes20,address,uint256,address)
                There are no modifiers should be examined in function createSwap.
                Check direct function security
                    - function EthTokenToSmthSwaps.createSwap(bytes20,address,uint256,address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                      Reason: No structures validate the identity of 'msg.sender' against a specific owner or leader variable.
                    - function EthTokenToSmthSwaps.createSwap(bytes20,address,uint256,address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                      Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures, such as `require(xxx == True)` followed by `xxx = False`, or `require(xxx ==
                      False)` followed by `xxx = True`, or equivalent `if` and throw patterns.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
