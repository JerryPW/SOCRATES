Function Security Analysis for ICO.buyTokens(uint256,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function buyTokens.
    Check direct function security
        - function ICO.buyTokens(uint256,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures involving msg.sender.
        - function ICO.buyTokens(uint256,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not have any of the required structures mentioned. It does not include any `require(xxx == True);`, `require(xxx == False);`,
          `require(!xxx);`, or `if(!xxx) throw;` statements where a variable is explicitly set to the opposite boolean value after the requirement. The conditions in the
          code are just using throw statements for error handling without following up with setting the examined variable to any boolean value.

    Analyze External Address
        There are ['erc20TokensContract'] should be checked in variable erc20TokensContract
        Checked variables: erc20TokensContract
            No The function 'setErc20TokensContract' is not a constructor as its name does not match the contract name 'ICO' and neither is it explicitly named
            'constructor'. Furthermore, the function does not hardcode the state variable 'erc20TokensContract'. Instead, it sets this variable using the passed argument
            '_erc20TokensContractAddress', which is dynamic and not fixed within the code.
            Function Security Analysis for ICO.setErc20TokensContract(address)
                There are no modifiers should be examined in function setErc20TokensContract.
                Check direct function security
                    - function ICO.setErc20TokensContract(address) has security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender, the function would not cause
                    REE problem.
                      Reason: The function uses `if (msg.sender != owner) {throw;}` which matches characteristic 3 as it directly compares msg.sender with a variable
                      named owner, not a local variable with a .owner pattern.
        There are ['erc20TokensContract'] should be checked in variable erc20TokensContract
        Checked variables: erc20TokensContract
            No 1. The function name does not match the contract name 'ICO', nor is it explicitly named 'constructor'. 2. The function modifies the state variable
            'erc20TokensContract' but does not hardcode it; it sets the variable based on the provided address parameter.
            Function Security Analysis for ICO.setErc20TokensContract(address)
                There are no modifiers should be examined in function setErc20TokensContract.
                Check direct function security
                    - function ICO.setErc20TokensContract(address) has security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender, the function would not cause
                    REE problem.
                      Reason: The function checks if `msg.sender != owner` and throws, which matches structure 3.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
