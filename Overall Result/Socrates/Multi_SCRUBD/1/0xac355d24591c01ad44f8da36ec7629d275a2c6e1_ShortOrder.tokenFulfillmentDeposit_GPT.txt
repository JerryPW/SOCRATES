Function Security Analysis for ShortOrder.tokenFulfillmentDeposit(address[2],uint256,uint256[8],uint8,bytes32[2])
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function tokenFulfillmentDeposit.
    Check direct function security
        - function ShortOrder.tokenFulfillmentDeposit(address[2],uint256,uint256[8],uint8,bytes32[2]) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of
        msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not have any restriction based on the msg.sender being a specific owner or equivalent entity. No require or if statement restricts
          actions specifically using a comparison between msg.sender and a defined owner variable or address, nor does it throw an exception based on such a condition.
        - function ShortOrder.tokenFulfillmentDeposit(address[2],uint256,uint256[8],uint8,bytes32[2]) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: After the require statement that checks '!orderRecord[msg.sender][orderHash].tokenDeposit', the subsequent state modification operation
          'orderRecord[msg.sender][orderHash].tokenDeposit = true;' occurs immediately after some state update operations related to token transfer and balance update are
          executed. This means that the state negation is not performed right after the check but happens later in the function logic, so it does not meet the requirement
          for an immediate state negation before main logic execution.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['Token(tokenUser[0]).transferFrom(msg.sender,this,amount)']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - Token(tokenUser[0]).transferFrom(msg.sender,this,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['Token(tokenUser[0]).transferFrom(msg.sender,this,amount)']
    Analyze External Address
        The variable 'tokenUser' in external call 'Token(tokenUser[0]).transferFrom(msg.sender,this,amount)' has no state variable assigned in
        ShortOrder.tokenFulfillmentDeposit(address[2],uint256,uint256[8],uint8,bytes32[2]). Therefore we check whether it has been hardcoded in the function.
            No The variable 'tokenUser' is not hardcoded in the given code. It is passed as a function parameter which means it can vary each time the function is called.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
