Function Security Analysis for Nothing.mintNOTHING(uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function mintNOTHING.
    Check direct function security
        - function Nothing.mintNOTHING(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not include any 'require', 'if', 'assert' statements checking msg.sender against an owner or leader address.
        - function Nothing.mintNOTHING(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not have any of the required structures. It only consists of require statements to enforce conditions and a for loop to mint
          tokens.

    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _safeMint.
    Check direct function security
        - function ERC721._safeMint(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not include any conditions involving msg.sender or similar checks against owner or specific roles.
        - function ERC721._safeMint(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code provided does not contain any of the specified structures, such as 'require(xxx == True)', 'require(xxx == False)', 'require(!xxx)', or 'if
          (!xxx) throw' followed by specific assignments to 'xxx'. It simply calls another _safeMint function, likely an overloaded version of it with additional
          parameters.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['mintNOTHING']

            There are no modifiers should be examined in function mintNOTHING.
            Check direct function security
                - function Nothing.mintNOTHING(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function 'mintNOTHING' does not include any of the specified structures that directly check if 'msg.sender' is a specific owner, address,
                  leader, or CEO.
                - function Nothing.mintNOTHING(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code doesn't have any of the specified structures. It contains calls to require statements, but none of them set a variable to a boolean
                  value immediately after a require or check its negation via '!xxx'. The structures specified in the task require a certain sequence of setting variables
                  based on conditions which are not present in this code. No variable is modified after a require or if condition as outlined.

    Check direct function security
        - function ERC721._checkOnERC721Received(address,address,uint256,bytes) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not perform any checks related to msg.sender involving ownership or leadership roles, such as checking if msg.sender is an owner or
          leader, as specified in the rules.
        - function ERC721._checkOnERC721Received(address,address,uint256,bytes) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: None of the specified code structures are present in this function. There is no 'require' statement or a specific 'if' condition followed by a 'throw'
          in the given code structure.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

                  Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures that check 'msg.sender'.
                - function ERC721._safeMint(address,uint256,bytes) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures. The function has a `require` statement checking a condition, but it does not
                  match the patterns listed, such as setting a variable to true or false after the require. Additionally, there are no if-throw statements or subsequent
                  true/false variable assignments as outlined.

                          Reason: The code does not contain any conditionals, require, or assert statements that check against msg.sender being an owner, leader, CEO, or
                          specific address.
