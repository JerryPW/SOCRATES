    Check direct function security
        - function XetherGames.sendDividends() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not have any of the mentioned structures that checks if msg.sender equals xxxOwner/xxxAddress or other such roles.
        - function XetherGames.sendDividends() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures: 1, 2, 3, or 4. There is no 'require' statement, no variable is being set to True or
          False after a check, nor is there an 'if' condition causing a throw followed by setting a variable to true or false.

        - xEtherTokensContract.ecosystemDividends.value(tmpDividends)() ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['xEtherTokensContract.ecosystemDividends.value(tmpDividends)()']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['xEtherTokensContract'] should be checked in variable xEtherTokensContract
        Checked variables: xEtherTokensContract
            No 1. The function 'setXEtherContract' is not a constructor because its name does not match the contract name 'XetherGames' and is not explicitly named
            'constructor'.  2. The function 'setXEtherContract' does not hardcode 'xEtherTokensContract'. Instead, it assigns 'xEtherTokensContract' based on the input
            parameter 'xEtherContract'. Thus, it's dynamically setting the state variable rather than hardcoding it.  Therefore, the function does not satisfy any of the
            given characteristics.
            Function Security Analysis for XetherGames.setXEtherContract(address)
                The modifier of function setXEtherContract are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The code in the modifier uses 'require(msg.sender == owner)' which satisfies rule 1 as it enforces that only the owner can execute the
                      function. There is no code related to lock operations, so rule 2 does not apply.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
