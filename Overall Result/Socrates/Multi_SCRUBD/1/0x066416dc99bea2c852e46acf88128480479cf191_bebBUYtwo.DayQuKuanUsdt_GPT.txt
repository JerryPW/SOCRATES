Function Security Analysis for bebBUYtwo.DayQuKuanUsdt()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function DayQuKuanUsdt.
    Check direct function security
        - function bebBUYtwo.DayQuKuanUsdt() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function DayQuKuanUsdt does not have any checks or assertions involving ownership or specific addresses as msg.sender. It only has conditional logic
          based on time and user's investment details.
        - function bebBUYtwo.DayQuKuanUsdt() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code doesn't contain any of the specified structures, such as conditions checking a variable with `require` and then changing the state of that
          variable immediately or subsequently. The given code mainly uses `require` statements for checking certain conditions about the current state of variables or
          contract conditions (e.g., if a user has invested, and if the BEBday has expired), but these are not followed by assignments directly related to the checked
          conditions that change the same variable's state. Ultimately, this doesn't match any of the four provided structures.

    Analyze External Address
        There are ['bebTokenTransfer'] should be checked in variable bebTokenTransfer
        Checked variables: bebTokenTransfer
            Yes The provided function name 'bebBUYtwo' matches the contract name, 'bebBUYtwo', indicating that the function is a constructor. This satisfies
            characteristic 1.
        There are ['bebTokenTransfer'] should be checked in variable bebTokenTransfer
        Checked variables: bebTokenTransfer
            Yes The function name matches the contract name 'bebBUYtwo', indicating that it is a constructor function according to Solidity conventions prior to version
            0.4.22 where constructors are named exactly as the contract. This satisfies the first characteristic of being a constructor function.
        There are ['bebTokenTransferUSDT'] should be checked in variable bebTokenTransferUSDT
        Checked variables: bebTokenTransferUSDT
            Yes The provided function 'bebBUYtwo' is a constructor because its name matches the name of the contract 'bebBUYtwo'. Additionally, the state variable
            'bebTokenTransferUSDT' is hardcoded in the function, satisfying both characteristics. Therefore, the criteria are met.
        There are ['bebTokenTransfer'] should be checked in variable bebTokenTransfer
        Checked variables: bebTokenTransfer
            Yes 1. The function name 'bebBUYtwo' matches the contract name 'bebBUYtwo', indicating that it is a constructor, as constructors in Solidity have the same
            name as the contract before Solidity 0.5.0. 2. The function also includes hardcoded values such as 'bebethex=5795;', 'decimals=18;', 'BEBday=20;',
            'bebjiage=172540000000000;', and 'usdtex=166;'. This satisfies the second criterion since these values are directly assigned within the function.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
