Function Security Analysis for MonkeyScam.withdraw()
    The modifier of function withdraw are ['isActivated', 'isHuman']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier isActivated has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier checks a state variable 'activated_' but does not impose a specific address check or use a lock mechanism. It does not meet any of the
          specified characteristics.
        - modifier isHuman has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier checks that the caller is not a smart contract by verifying the extcodesize, but it does not directly restrict access to specific addresses
          or the owner. It also does not perform any lock operations or have a naming that suggests owner restriction or lock operations.
    Check direct function security
        - function MonkeyScam.withdraw() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any require, if, or assert statements that check specifically for msg.sender to be equal to or not equal to
          xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
        - function MonkeyScam.withdraw() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: This function does not have any of the specified required structures. It mainly focuses on executing logic related to withdrawing funds based on
          conditions of round completion or status, but does not adhere to any of the provided algorithmic patterns.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['plyr_[_pID].addr.transfer(_eth)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - plyr_[_pID].addr.transfer(_eth) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: This external call contains
        '.transfer(' keyword, which satisfies one of the specified characteristics for the external call.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: MonkeyScam.endRound(LDdatasets.EventReturns)
Function Security Analysis for MonkeyScam.endRound(LDdatasets.EventReturns)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function endRound.
    Check direct function security
        - function MonkeyScam.endRound(LDdatasets.EventReturns) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any msg.sender checks relating to permissibility based on specific roles such as Owner, Address, Leader, or CEO.
        - function MonkeyScam.endRound(LDdatasets.EventReturns) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not have any `require(xxx == True)` or `require(xxx == False)` statements, nor does it have `if(!xxx) throw` structure. Thus, it doesn't
          match with any of the given structure patterns.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['reLoadXname', 'buyCore', 'reLoadCore', 'buyXid', 'reLoadXaddr', 'withdraw', 'fallback', 'reLoadXid', 'buyXaddr', 'buyXname']
        Function Security Analysis for MonkeyScam.reLoadXname(bytes32,uint256)
            The modifier of function reLoadXname are ['isActivated', 'isHuman', 'isWithinLimits']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier isActivated has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: None of the characteristics are satisfied: 1. The modifier checks if a variable 'activated_' is true, not if the function is executed by an
                  owner or specific address. 2. There is no lock mechanism ensuring the function runs only once. 3. The name 'isActivated' does not imply owner control or
                  non-reentrancy.
                - modifier isHuman has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier checks if the msg.sender is a non-contract address to ensure that only humans (EOAs, Externally Owned Accounts) can interact with
                  the function. This does not directly fit into enforcing owner or specific address execution, nor does it use locking operations. The modifier name also
                  doesn't suggest ownership or non-reentry characteristics.
                - modifier isWithinLimits has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The code does not enforce address checks for ownership or specific addresses, nor does it use a lock operation or have a convincing modifier
                  name indicating such checks.
            Check direct function security
                - function MonkeyScam.reLoadXname(bytes32,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The given code does not include any require or assert statements checking for msg.sender against owner or specific address roles, nor does it
                  include any conditional checks throwing an error based on msg.sender roles.
                - function MonkeyScam.reLoadXname(bytes32,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the required structures. There is no `require` or `if (!xxx) throw` statement that sets a variable and then
                  changes its state as described.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['address(MonkeyKingCorp).call.value(_com)(bytes4(keccak256()(deposit())))']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - address(MonkeyKingCorp).call.value(_com)(bytes4(keccak256()(deposit()))) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['address(MonkeyKingCorp).call.value(_com)(bytes4(keccak256()(deposit())))']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['MonkeyKingCorp'] should be checked in variable MonkeyKingCorp
        Checked variables: MonkeyKingCorp
            State variable MonkeyKingCorp has initialized in public area after declaration.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
