Function Security Analysis for YZYVault.unstake(uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function unstake.
    Check direct function security
        - function YZYVault.unstake(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code snippet does not contain any statement that directly checks or asserts the identity of msg.sender being a specific owner or address role such
          as xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO using require, if, or assert. The conditions are focused on checking contract status or staked amounts.
        - function YZYVault.unstake(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon re-evaluation, the code contains `require(!isContract(_msgSender()), "Vault: Could not be contract.");`, but it does not directly follow with an
          assignment of the variable related to the `require` statement. The check is a `require` condition without an immediate follow-up of a specific assignment
          structure involving the same checked variable (`xxx`). Therefore, it does not meet any of the required structures fully.

        Checked variables: _yzyETHV2Pair
            No The function 'changeYzyETHPair' is not a constructor because its name does not match the contract name 'YZYVault', nor is it named 'constructor'.
            Additionally, the function does not hardcode the state variable '_yzyETHV2Pair'; instead, it assigns a value by converting the function argument 'yzyETHPair'
            using the interface 'IUniswapV2Pair'. Therefore, neither condition is satisfied.

                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The code uses a require statement to ensure that the function can only be executed by the owner (_owner == _msgSender()). This matches rule
                      1, which checks for owner or specific address access restriction.
        There are ['_yzyETHV2Pair'] should be checked in variable _yzyETHV2Pair
        Checked variables: _yzyETHV2Pair
            No 1. The function name 'changeYzyETHPair' does not match the contract name 'YZYVault', nor is it explicitly named 'constructor', so it is not a constructor.
            2. The function 'changeYzyETHPair' does modify the state variable '_yzyETHV2Pair', but the value is not hardcoded. Instead, it is set to
            'IUniswapV2Pair(yzyETHPair)', which means it takes a parameter value rather than a hardcoded value.

                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The modifier enforces that only the owner can execute the function by using the 'require' statement with '_msgSender()'. The structure
                      matches the characteristic in rule 1.
        There are ['_yzyETHV2Pair'] should be checked in variable _yzyETHV2Pair
        Checked variables: _yzyETHV2Pair
            No The given code snippet is a function called 'changeYzyETHPair', which does not match the contract name 'YZYVault' and is not explicitly named
            'constructor'. Hence, it does not satisfy the constructor condition. Additionally, the function does not hardcode the state variable '_yzyETHV2Pair'; instead,
            it assigns it based on the function argument 'yzyETHPair'. Therefore, it does not satisfy any of the given characteristics.

                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The part of the code 'require(_owner == _msgSender())' enforces that only the owner can execute the function, which matches structure 1.
                      There are no references or operations concerning flags or reentrancy locks, so structure 2 is not applicable here. Therefore, the judgment remains
                      based solely on structure 1.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

            No 1. The function 'changeYzyAddress' is not a constructor because its name does not match the contract name 'YZYVault', and it is not explicitly named
            'constructor'.  2. The state variable '_yzy' is assigned a value through function parameter 'yzy', which means it is not hardcoded in the function. Hardcoding
            would mean the state variable is assigned a constant or predefined value directly within the function code.
            Function Security Analysis for YZYVault.changeYzyAddress(address)
                The modifier of function changeYzyAddress are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The modifier employs 'require(_owner == _msgSender(), ...)' which matches the pattern of enforcing execution by only specific addresses (in
                      this case, the owner). This satisfies the criteria under rule 1. Further, there are no indications of lock/unlock operations within the provided
                      code, thus rule 2 does not apply.

    Check direct function security
        - function YZYVault._sendLotteryAmount() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not include any checks for msg.sender against any specific conditional structures for ownership or leadership.
        - function YZYVault._sendLotteryAmount() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not have any require statements or if-throw structure that modifies a boolean variable as specified in any of the listed
          patterns. Specifically, it starts with if statements checking conditions, but does not have a require or throw/exception structure as needed for those
          conditions.

                  xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO account.
                - function YZYVault.claimYzyReward() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures. There is no require statement with a fixed boolean comparison to True or False
                  followed by a direct assignment of that variable to the opposite boolean value, nor an if statement throwing an exception based on a negation followed
                  by setting that variable to true. The requirements involve logical flow control based on comparisons and require statements, but they don't match the

        - function YZYVault._swapAndClaimTokens(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not match any of the specified structures involving a boolean variable check and mutation. The code only uses numerical checks with

                - function YZYVault.stake() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code contains 'require(!isContract(_msgSender()), ...);' followed by several operations. However, there is no subsequent statement setting
                  'isContract' to True, nor any statement setting it to False. Thus, it does not fully match any of the required structures as both first two statements
                  (i.e., the require statement and a variable assignment) must be matched.

        - function YZYVault.safeYzyTransfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any 'require' or 'if' statements that meet the specific patterns outlined, such as checking if a variable equals True or False
          and then negating it. Instead, it uses a simple conditional to check if amount exceeds balance, which does not match any of the specified structures.

                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The modifier contains the statement `require(_owner == _msgSender(), "Ownable: caller is not the owner");` which enforces that only the
                      owner can execute the function, corresponding to rule 1. There is no indication of a lock mechanism as described in rule 2. Therefore, rule 1 is the
                      applicable rule here.

            No 1. The function name ('changeYzyAddress') does not match the contract name ('YZYVault') nor is it named 'constructor', so it is not a constructor.  2. The
            function 'changeYzyAddress' updates the state variable '_yzy' with a new address passed as an argument. It does not have a hardcoded assignment to the state
            variable '_yzy'.

    Analyze External Address
        The variable 'fromTokenAddress' in external call 'IERC20(fromTokenAddress).approve(address(_uniswapV2Router),tokenAmount)' has no state variable assigned in
        YZYVault.swapTokensForTokens(address,address,uint256,address). Considering that it is an internal/private function, we analyze the function inputs.

            There are ['_yzy'] should be checked in variable _yzy
            Checked variables: _yzy
                No The function named 'changeYzyAddress' is not a constructor because its name does not match the contract name 'YZYVault' and is not explicitly named
                'constructor'. Additionally, the state variable '_yzy' is set dynamically using the parameter 'yzy' passed to the function and is not hardcoded within the
                function itself.
            Function Security Analysis for YZYVault.changeYzyAddress(address)
                The modifier of function changeYzyAddress are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The modifier onlyOwner uses the require statement to enforce that only the owner can execute the function, matching rule 1. No code
                      structure for rule 2 is present in this modifier since there's no lock mechanism observed within the code.
            There are ['_weth'] should be checked in variable _weth
            Checked variables: _weth
                Yes The code provided is a constructor because the function name is not explicitly provided and is named 'constructor', which matches the second point of
                the first characteristic. Constructors are typically used for initializing contracts and do not have a return value. The presence of a constructor
                indicates initialization logic for the contract.
            There are ['_weth'] should be checked in variable _weth
            Checked variables: _weth
                Yes The code snippet provided is indeed a constructor function. This is evident because the function name matches 'constructor', which is a keyword in
                Solidity that indicates the code block is a constructor for the contract. Moreover, the logic inside the function includes setting initial state
                variables, another characteristic typical of constructor functions. The contract name 'YZYVault' also matches the characteristics of the constructor
                function.
        There are ['_uniswapV2Router'] should be checked in variable _uniswapV2Router
        Checked variables: _uniswapV2Router
            Yes The provided code is a constructor because the function is named 'constructor', which explicitly indicates it is a constructor in Solidity. Although it
            does initialize the state variable '_uniswapV2Router', the determination was based solely on the function being a constructor, aligning with characteristic 1.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
