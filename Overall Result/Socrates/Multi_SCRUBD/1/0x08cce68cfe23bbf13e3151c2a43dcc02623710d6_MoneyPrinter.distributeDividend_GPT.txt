Function Security Analysis for MoneyPrinter.distributeDividend(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function distributeDividend.
    Check direct function security
        - function MoneyPrinter.distributeDividend(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any checks to compare msg.sender with a specific owner, address, leader, or CEO. It only handles dividend distribution based
          on shareholder data.
        - function MoneyPrinter.distributeDividend(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures. It contains conditional checks and operations, but none of them match the exact patterns
          given in the characteristics.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['setShare', 'goBrrr', 'process']
        Function Security Analysis for MoneyPrinter.setShare(address,uint256)
            The modifier of function setShare are ['onlyToken']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyToken is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: Upon reviewing the code, the modifier `onlyToken` includes a statement `require(msg.sender == _token);`, which is a structure that enforces
                  access control, meeting rule 1.
        Function Security Analysis for MoneyPrinter.goBrrr(address)
            The modifier of function goBrrr are ['onlyToken']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyToken is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: Upon re-evaluation, the modifier onlyToken contains a require statement ("require(msg.sender == _token);"), which checks whether the sender of
                  the message is the address stored in _token. This aligns with characteristic 1, as it restricts access to a specific address.
        Function Security Analysis for MoneyPrinter.process(uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function process.
            Check direct function security
                - function MoneyPrinter.process(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any require, if, or assert statements that involve checking if msg.sender is equal to any ownership or leadership
                  identifier such as xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO.
                - function MoneyPrinter.process(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code provided does not contain any of the identified structures involving conditional checks (`require` or `if` statements) followed by
                  assignments that match the described patterns.

        - IERC20(DigitalGold).transfer(shareholder,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['IERC20(DigitalGold).transfer(shareholder,amount)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['DigitalGold'] should be checked in variable DigitalGold
        Checked variables: DigitalGold
            Yes The provided code includes a constructor function because there is a function named 'constructor'. Moreover, this constructor explicitly assigns a
            hardcoded value to the state variable 'DigitalGold'. This satisfies both Rule 1 (it is a constructor) and Rule 2 (hardcoded state variable).
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
