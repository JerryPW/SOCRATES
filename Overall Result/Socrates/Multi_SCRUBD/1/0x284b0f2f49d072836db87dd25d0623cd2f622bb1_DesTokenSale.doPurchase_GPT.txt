Function Security Analysis for DesTokenSale.doPurchase(address)
    The modifier of function doPurchase are ['stopInEmergency']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier stopInEmergency has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier name does not align with typical names indicating owner checks or lock patterns like 'Onlyxxx' or 'nonReentrant'. The modifier does not
          contain any logical structures or conditions that match those described in rules 1 or 2 (like checking msg.sender or using lock/unlock mechanisms). It checks a
          state variable, 'halted', which does not imply owner control or reentrancy protection.
    Check direct function security
        - function DesTokenSale.doPurchase(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any explicit checks involving msg.sender compared to any xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
        - function DesTokenSale.doPurchase(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not include any of the specified structures as it only contains multiple 'require' statements that check conditions without
          subsequently altering a boolean variable corresponding to those checks as outlined in the instructions.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['fallback', 'doPurchaseFor']
        Function Security Analysis for DesTokenSale.fallback()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
            Check direct function security
                - function DesTokenSale.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: This function does not contain any checks or conditions related to msg.sender comparing to any owner or address. It simply calls another
                  function with msg.sender as an argument.
                - function DesTokenSale.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code provided does not contain any 'require' or 'if' statement checking a variable to be true or false, followed by changing the variable's
                  state as specified in the problem's conditions.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['token.balanceOf(_sender)', 'token.balanceOf(_sender).add(tokens)', 'token.transfer(_sender,tokens)', 'beneficiary.transfer(msg.value)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - token.transfer(_sender,tokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - beneficiary.transfer(msg.value) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call
        'beneficiary.transfer(msg.value)' contains the keyword '.transfer(' which matches the first rule.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - token.balanceOf(_sender) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - token.balanceOf(_sender).add(tokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - token.transfer(_sender,tokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['token.balanceOf(_sender)', 'token.balanceOf(_sender).add(tokens)', 'token.transfer(_sender,tokens)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            Yes The given code snippet shows a function with the name 'DesTokenSale', which is the same as the contract name. This indicates that the function is a
            constructor in earlier versions of Solidity (prior to 0.4.22) where constructors had the same name as the contract. Therefore, this external call satisfies
            the first characteristic, which is to check if the code is a constructor.
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            Yes The function name 'DesTokenSale' matches the contract name, thus indicating that this is a constructor function. In Solidity, prior to version 0.4.22,
            constructors were written as functions with the same name as the contract name, therefore fulfilling characteristic 1.
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            Yes 1. The function name 'DesTokenSale' matches the contract name 'DesTokenSale', which suggests it is a constructor. In Solidity versions prior to 0.4.22,
            constructors were named the same as the contract name.  2. The code does not hardcode the state variable. The variable 'token' is set by passing an argument
            '_token' to the constructor and assigning it to 'token', which means it is not hardcoded.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
