Function Security Analysis for ERC721._safeMint(address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _safeMint.
    Check direct function security
        - function ERC721._safeMint(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The provided code snippet does not contain any checks or assertions related to 'msg.sender' against specific roles such as Owner, Address, Leader, or
          CEO. It is simply a function that calls another '_safeMint' function, likely a form of method overloading or chaining without any access control logic involved.
        - function ERC721._safeMint(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures. There are no 'require' statements or if conditions that check a boolean variable and
          then change its value as outlined in the characteristics.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['mintNOTHING']
        Function Security Analysis for Nothing.mintNOTHING(uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function mintNOTHING.
            Check direct function security
                - function Nothing.mintNOTHING(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any explicit checks involving `msg.sender` against an owner, address, leader, or CEO pattern as per the specified
                  characteristics.
                - function Nothing.mintNOTHING(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The given code does not contain any of the specified structures where a require statement checks a boolean condition and subsequently changes
                  that boolean variable's value.

Function Security Analysis for ERC721._checkOnERC721Received(address,address,uint256,bytes)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _checkOnERC721Received.
    Check direct function security
        - function ERC721._checkOnERC721Received(address,address,uint256,bytes) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any checks or assertions related to the comparison against msg.sender and xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
        - function ERC721._checkOnERC721Received(address,address,uint256,bytes) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function provided does not initially have a require or if(!xxx) throw statement followed by setting the same variable to true. Neither does it have
          a require statement with a condition of a variable followed by changing that variable boolean value eventually. Therefore, it does not satisfy any of the
          specified patterns.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['_safeMint', 'mintNOTHING', '_safeMint', '_safeTransfer', 'safeTransferFrom', 'safeTransferFrom']

            Check direct function security
                - function ERC721._safeMint(address,uint256,bytes) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not include any authorization checks against specific addresses or roles like owner, leader, CEO, or specified addresses.
                - function ERC721._safeMint(address,uint256,bytes) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code provided uses a require statement, but it does not include either of the specified structures involving Boolean variable checks and
                  modifications.
            Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

                        - function Nothing.mintNOTHING(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                          Reason: The function does not use any of the specified structures related to msg.sender and xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
                        - function Nothing.mintNOTHING(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                          Reason: None of the require statements in the provided code are related to a variable being true or false as required by the structures. They
                          are only checking conditions and throwing errors without changing the state of the variable involved.

        internal/private function, we analyze the function inputs.
        Analyze External Address
            The variable 'to' in external call 'to' has no state variable assigned in ERC721._safeMint(address,uint256,bytes). Considering that it is an internal/private
            function, we analyze the function inputs.
            Analyze External Address
                The variable 'to' in external call 'to' has no state variable assigned in ERC721._safeMint(address,uint256). Considering that it is an internal/private
