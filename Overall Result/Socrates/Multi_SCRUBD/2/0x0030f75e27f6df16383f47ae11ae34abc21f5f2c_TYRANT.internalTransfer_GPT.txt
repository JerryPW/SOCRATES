Function Security Analysis for TYRANT.internalTransfer(address,address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function internalTransfer.
    Check direct function security
        - function TYRANT.internalTransfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not have require/assert conditions checking msg.sender against a specific owner/leader address or a similar role.
        - function TYRANT.internalTransfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon closer inspection, the provided code only contains `require(!isBot[from], ...)` but does not contain `isBot[from] = True;`. The structure strictly
          requires both statements to be present to make a correct judgment under type 3 structure. Therefore, the code does not fully match any of the specified
          structures.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['withdrawStuckTokens', 'manualBurnTokensFromLP', 'transfer', 'AirDrop', 'transferFrom']
        Function Security Analysis for TYRANT.withdrawStuckTokens(uint256)
            The modifier of function withdrawStuckTokens are ['onlyOwner']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The modifier explicitly enforces that only the owner can execute the function by using the require statement `require(owner() == _msgSender(),
                  "ERC20Ownable: caller is not the owner");` which matches the first characteristic of checking whether only specific addresses like the owner can execute
                  the function.
        Function Security Analysis for TYRANT.manualBurnTokensFromLP(uint256)
            The modifier of function manualBurnTokensFromLP are ['onlyOwner']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: Upon reviewing the code again, the modifier 'onlyOwner' contains the statement 'require(owner() == _msgSender(), "ERC20Ownable: caller is not
                  the owner");'. This confirms that the function checks if the caller is the owner, which satisfies the first rule of checking if only the owner or
                  specific addresses can execute the function. There are no structural omissions as this is the primary requirement in the modifier.
        Function Security Analysis for TYRANT.transfer(address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transfer.
            Check direct function security
                - function TYRANT.transfer(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not include any statement that matches the structures outlined for requiring or checking the identity of msg.sender against a
                  specific owner or leader address.
                - function TYRANT.transfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided function does not contain any of the specified control structures. It simply performs an internal transfer operation and returns a
                  boolean value, without using any conditional statements or manipulations of boolean variables.

    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: TYRANT.taxTokenSwap()
Function Security Analysis for TYRANT.taxTokenSwap()
    The modifier of function taxTokenSwap are ['lockTheSwap']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier lockTheSwap is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The modifier lockTheSwap includes setting inSwapAndLiquify to true at the start and resetting it to false afterward. Both operations, lock, and unlock,
          are present in the structure, which matches rule 2 for using a lock mechanism.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
