    There are no modifiers should be examined in function cancelTokenTransaction.
    Check direct function security
        - function Escrow.cancelTokenTransaction(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain a statement involving msg.sender checking against an owner, leader, or CEO equivalent entity to determine permissions or
          throw an exception. It only involves transaction status and token operations.
        - function Escrow.cancelTokenTransaction(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon re-evaluating the code, it contains 'require(transaction.status == transactionStatus.Pending);' but does not have the statement 'transaction.status
          = false;'. Since both statements need to be present to match any structural pattern precisely (according to the criteria), it does not fully match any of the
          specified structures.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['cancel']
        Function Security Analysis for Escrow.cancel(address)
            The modifier of function cancel are ['onlyAllowed']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyAllowed is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: Re-evaluating the given code segment: The modifier onlyAllowed contains the statement 'require(msg.sender == owner || msg.sender ==
                  eternal.getAddress(0));'. This statement ensures that only the sender who is the owner or a specific address obtained from eternal.getAddress(0) can
                  execute the function. This matches characteristic 1 from the instructions provided, which talks about verifying ownership or specific address execution
                  rights.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
