External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,amount/price)', 'beneficiary.send(amountRaised)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,amount/price) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - beneficiary.send(amountRaised) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        'beneficiary.send(amountRaised)' contains the '.send(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,amount/price) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,amount/price)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['tokenReward'] should be checked in variable tokenReward
        Checked variables: tokenReward
            Yes The provided external call code is a constructor because the function name 'Crowdsale' matches the contract name 'Crowdsale'. However, the state variable
            'tokenReward' is being assigned a value from an argument 'addressOfTokenUsedAsReward', and therefore, it is not hardcoded within the constructor.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
