    Check direct function security
        - function CRYPTOVATOR._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not include any of the specified structures involving `msg.sender`. It contains multiple `require` checks but none of them involve
          `msg.sender == xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO` or related conditions.
        - function CRYPTOVATOR._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon re-evaluation, the initial assessment was incorrect. The code does not have both parts of any defined structure required for a 'Yes' judgment.
          Specifically, while the code contains multiple `require` statements, none of them are matched by a subsequent setting of that variable, such as `blackListAdd`
          or `tradingActive`. The presence of require statements without corresponding variable assignments pertinent to the exact conditions means the initial 'Yes'
          judgment was incorrect. There should not have been an implicit linking of unrelated variables as in the initial misinterpretation of `boughtEarly` with
          `blackListAdd`. Therefore, the correct response is 'No'.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transferFrom', 'transfer']
        Function Security Analysis for CRYPTOVATOR.transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transferFrom.
            Check direct function security
                - function CRYPTOVATOR.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The provided function does not include any of the specific structures that involve comparing or asserting the `msg.sender` with any owner,
                  address, leader, or CEO identifier as outlined in the criteria.
                - function CRYPTOVATOR.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures: requirements or if-throw controls over a variable, and state changes from false to
                  true or from true to false.

Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: CRYPTOVATOR.swapBack()
Function Security Analysis for CRYPTOVATOR.swapBack()
    The modifier of function swapBack are ['lockTheSwap']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier lockTheSwap is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: Upon re-evaluating the code, it's confirmed that the lockTheSwap modifier sets the 'inSwapAndLiquify' flag to true before the function execution and
          resets it to false afterwards. The presence of both lock ('inSwapAndLiquify = true;') and unlock ('inSwapAndLiquify = false;') operations fulfill the condition
          for characteristic 2.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
