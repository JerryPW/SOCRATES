Function Security Analysis for CoolUncle.distributeDividend(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function distributeDividend.
    Check direct function security
        - function CoolUncle.distributeDividend(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not have any checks or conditions related to msg.sender, and hence, it does not match any of the specified characteristics.
        - function CoolUncle.distributeDividend(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures: there is no 'require' statement, and no variable is checked for a boolean condition then
          negated and updated within the code.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['setShare', 'process', 'gibSHIL']
        Function Security Analysis for CoolUncle.setShare(address,uint256)
            The modifier of function setShare are ['onlyToken']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyToken is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The modifier enforces that only a specific address (_token) can execute the function, which aligns with characteristic 1. The code contains the
                  statement 'require(msg.sender == _token);', meeting the requirement that msg.sender is a specific address (_token).
        Function Security Analysis for CoolUncle.process(uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function process.
            Check direct function security
                - function CoolUncle.process(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code only contains some gas and dividend distribution logic without any conditions that check the equality or inequality of msg.sender to
                  owner or management addresses.
                - function CoolUncle.process(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain a require or if statement with a matching change of state for a boolean variable as specified in the structures.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['IERC20(SHIL).transfer(shareholder,amount)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - IERC20(SHIL).transfer(shareholder,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - IERC20(SHIL).transfer(shareholder,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['IERC20(SHIL).transfer(shareholder,amount)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['SHIL'] should be checked in variable SHIL
        Checked variables: SHIL
            Yes 1. The function in the provided code is explicitly named 'constructor', indicating it is a constructor. 2. The constructor contains the state variable
            'SHIL', which is set to a hardcoded address '0x20c3fa331A385b63EE39137e99d0cF2db142fCe1'. This satisfies the second condition.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
