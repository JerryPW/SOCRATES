    Check direct function security
        - function TrustlessOTC.cancelTrade(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code uses 'require(msg.sender == o.creator);', where 'o.creator' is a local variable, and according to the note, comparisons using local variables
          do not match the required structure.
        - function TrustlessOTC.cancelTrade(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any require statements followed by assignments of the type specified in the given characteristics. There is a require
          statement 'require(msg.sender == o.creator)' but it is not followed by anything resembling the pattern provided.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['msg.sender.transfer(o.amountFrom)', 'TokenNoReturn(o.tokenFrom).transfer(o.creator,o.amountFrom)',
    'Token(o.tokenFrom).transfer(o.creator,o.amountFrom)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - msg.sender.transfer(o.amountFrom) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the
        '.transfer(' keyword: 'msg.sender.transfer(o.amountFrom)'.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - TokenNoReturn(o.tokenFrom).transfer(o.creator,o.amountFrom) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - Token(o.tokenFrom).transfer(o.creator,o.amountFrom) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - TokenNoReturn(o.tokenFrom).transfer(o.creator,o.amountFrom) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - Token(o.tokenFrom).transfer(o.creator,o.amountFrom) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['TokenNoReturn(o.tokenFrom).transfer(o.creator,o.amountFrom)', 'Token(o.tokenFrom).transfer(o.creator,o.amountFrom)']
    Analyze External Address
        The variable 'o' in external call 'TokenNoReturn(o.tokenFrom).transfer(o.creator,o.amountFrom)' has no state variable assigned in
        TrustlessOTC.cancelTrade(uint256). Therefore we check whether it has been hardcoded in the function.
            No The variable 'o' is not hardcoded. It is assigned the value retrieved from the 'offers' array using 'tradeID' as an index, which is a parameter of the
            function 'cancelTrade'. This means the value of 'o' is dynamic and depends on the input provided each time the function is called.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
