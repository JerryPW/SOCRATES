Function Security Analysis for BEAST._transfer(address,address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _transfer.
    Check direct function security
        - function BEAST._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures where msg.sender is compared to xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO for conditions using 'require',
          'if', or 'assert'.
        - function BEAST._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not contain a pattern that matches any of the specified structures. There are 'require' statements, but none fit the form such as
          'require(xxx == true); xxx = false;' or the other patterns listed.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transfer', 'transferFrom']
        Function Security Analysis for BEAST.transfer(address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transfer.
            Check direct function security
                - function BEAST.transfer(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not check for the sender's address being equal to a particular owner, address, leader, or CEO. It simply calls another
                  function `_transfer` using `msg.sender`, without any of the structures listed in the conditions.
                - function BEAST.transfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The given code does not contain any require statement or if statement that throws, nor does it modify a variable after checking a condition with
                  require or if. As none of the specified structures are present, the function does not meet any listed condition.

        - bensRevival.setShare(sender,_balances[sender]) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - bensRevival.setShare(recipient,_balances[recipient]) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['bensRevival.setShare(sender,_balances[sender])', 'bensRevival.setShare(recipient,_balances[recipient])']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['bensRevival'] should be checked in variable bensRevival
        Checked variables: bensRevival
            Yes The provided code snippet contains a constructor for the contract. This is identified by the function explicitly named 'constructor'.
        There are ['bensRevival'] should be checked in variable bensRevival
        Checked variables: bensRevival
            Yes The provided code is a constructor. The function is explicitly named 'constructor', which satisfies the first characteristic for a 'Yes' output according
            to the given rules.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: BEAST.swapBack()
Function Security Analysis for BEAST.swapBack()
    The modifier of function swapBack are ['lockTheSwap']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier lockTheSwap is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The modifier 'lockTheSwap' includes both a lock operation by setting 'inSwapAndLiquify' to true before executing the function and an unlock operation by
          resetting it to false afterward. This matches the locking structure criteria mentioned in Rule 2.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
