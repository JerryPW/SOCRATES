    There are no modifiers should be examined in function transfer.
    Check direct function security
        - function VestingContractWTTEST.transfer(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not include any condition or assertion that checks whether msg.sender is equal to or not equal to xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO. It
          only contains conditions based on token balance and transfer limits.
        - function VestingContractWTTEST.transfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not match any of the specified structures listed. It contains a require statement but does not change the same variable status
          based on the logic provided.

    Analyze External Address
        There are ['we_test_token'] should be checked in variable we_test_token
        Checked variables: we_test_token
            Yes The function named 'VestingContractWTTEST' matches the contract name 'VestingContractWTTEST', indicating that it is a constructor. Constructors by default
            set the initial state of a contract and are not directly related to the state variable initialization. However, the function does set the state variable
            'we_test_token' with a parameter '_we_test_token', which means it's not hardcoded in the function body. Therefore, it does not satisfy the second
            characteristic but does satisfy the first one.
        There are ['we_test_token'] should be checked in variable we_test_token
        Checked variables: we_test_token
            Yes The function is named 'VestingContractWTTEST', which matches the contract name 'VestingContractWTTEST', indicating that this is a constructor function. As
            such, it satisfies the first characteristic of being a constructor, regardless of whether it hardcodes any state variable.  Additionally, the state variable
            'we_test_token' is used as a parameter '_we_test_token' in the constructor, but it is not hardcoded. Hence, it does not satisfy the second characteristic.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
