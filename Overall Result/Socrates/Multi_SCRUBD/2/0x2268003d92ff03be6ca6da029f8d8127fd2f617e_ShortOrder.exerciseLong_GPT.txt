Function Security Analysis for ShortOrder.exerciseLong(address[2],uint256[8],uint8,bytes32[2])
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function exerciseLong.
    Check direct function security
        - function ShortOrder.exerciseLong(address[2],uint256[8],uint8,bytes32[2]) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any statements that check for 'msg.sender' against any form of owner or authority address as defined by the characteristics.
        - function ShortOrder.exerciseLong(address[2],uint256[8],uint8,bytes32[2]) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided function doesn't contain any of the specified structures. There is a require statement but it doesn't include changing the same variable as
          specified in the structures. Additionally, there is no change of a boolean variable before and after the require statement.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['msg.sender.transfer(couponAmount)', 'Token(tokenUser[0]).transfer(msg.sender,amount)',
    'msg.sender.transfer(safeAdd(couponAmount,orderRecord[tokenUser[1]][orderHash].longBalance[msg.sender]))']
    Analyze Transfer
        - msg.sender.transfer(couponAmount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains
        '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - msg.sender.transfer(safeAdd(couponAmount,orderRecord[tokenUser[1]][orderHash].longBalance[msg.sender])) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no
        potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - Token(tokenUser[0]).transfer(msg.sender,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['Token(tokenUser[0]).transfer(msg.sender,amount)']
    Analyze External Address
        The variable 'tokenUser' in external call 'Token(tokenUser[0]).transfer(msg.sender,amount)' has no state variable assigned in
        ShortOrder.exerciseLong(address[2],uint256[8],uint8,bytes32[2]). Therefore we check whether it has been hardcoded in the function.
            No The function uses 'tokenUser' as an input parameter in various computations and logical checks. There is no indication or evidence in the code that
            'tokenUser' has a fixed or constant value. It is dynamically used based on the function call, which implies it is not hardcoded.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
