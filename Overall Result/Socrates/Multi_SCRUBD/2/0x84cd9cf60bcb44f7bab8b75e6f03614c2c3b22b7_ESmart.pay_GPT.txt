        Function Security Analysis for ESmart.fallback()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
            Check direct function security
                - function ESmart.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not involve any conditionals or assertions directly related to checking if msg.sender is an xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO.

                  Reason: The function does not contain 'require' statements checking a boolean variable directly followed by an assignment to the same boolean. It also
                  lacks an 'if' statement checking a boolean variable and throwing an exception if false, followed by setting the boolean to true. Therefore, it doesn't
                  match any of the specified structures.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['dep.depositor.send(dep.expect)', 'dep.depositor.send(money)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - dep.depositor.send(dep.expect) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the
        '.send(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - dep.depositor.send(money) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the '.send('
        keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
