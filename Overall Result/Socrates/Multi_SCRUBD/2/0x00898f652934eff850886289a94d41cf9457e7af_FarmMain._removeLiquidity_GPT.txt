Function Security Analysis for FarmMain._removeLiquidity(uint256,uint256,bool,uint256,bool)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _removeLiquidity.
    Check direct function security
        - function FarmMain._removeLiquidity(uint256,uint256,bool,uint256,bool) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specific authorization patterns listed (e.g., checking for msg.sender being a specific owner or leader).
        - function FarmMain._removeLiquidity(uint256,uint256,bool,uint256,bool) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the required structures. There are no 'require' statements or 'if' statements that throw, followed by an assignment as
          specified.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['unlock', 'withdrawLiquidity']
        Function Security Analysis for FarmMain.unlock(uint256,bool)
            The modifier of function unlock are ['byPositionOwner']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier byPositionOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: Upon re-evaluation, the modifier 'byPositionOwner' indeed contains the code structure require(_positions[positionId].uniqueOwner == msg.sender,
                  ...), which enforces that only specific addresses (unique owner) can execute the function. This matches rule 1. No structural omissions were found as
                  the requirement checks for msg.sender ownership relate specifically to executing as the unique owner of a position.
        Function Security Analysis for FarmMain.withdrawLiquidity(uint256,uint256,bool,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function withdrawLiquidity.
            Check direct function security
                - function FarmMain.withdrawLiquidity(uint256,uint256,bool,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified conditions where `msg.sender` is compared directly to an owner or authorized address with any
                  of the structures mentioned.
                - function FarmMain.withdrawLiquidity(uint256,uint256,bool,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The given code snippet does not contain any of the specified structures. There are no require statements followed by an assignment of the same
                  variable to a boolean value as outlined in the conditions.

    Analyze External Address
        There are ['_setupsInfo'] should be checked in variable setupInfo
        Checked variables: _setupsInfo
            No The function '_setOrAddFarmingSetupInfo' does reference the state variable '_setupsInfo', but it doesn't hardcode it. It manipulates '_setupsInfo' by
            referencing an index '_farmingSetupsInfoCount' and other indices, which are variables. The function is not a constructor since it is named
            '_setOrAddFarmingSetupInfo', not matching the contract name 'FarmMain' nor explicitly named 'constructor'. Therefore, it doesn't satisfy the given
            characteristics.
            Function Security Analysis for FarmMain._setOrAddFarmingSetupInfo(FarmingSetupInfo,bool,bool,uint256)
                There are no modifiers should be examined in function _setOrAddFarmingSetupInfo.
                Check direct function security
                    - function FarmMain._setOrAddFarmingSetupInfo(FarmingSetupInfo,bool,bool,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of
                    msg.sender
                      Reason: The code does not have any condition that directly checks for `msg.sender` to compare with `xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO` using `require`,
                      `if`, or `assert`. It primarily focuses on modifying and checking the validity of input setup information for farming setups without accessing or
                      comparing the account calling the function.
                    - function FarmMain._setOrAddFarmingSetupInfo(FarmingSetupInfo,bool,bool,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                      Reason: The given code does not contain any of the specified structures. Although there are require statements checking conditions, they are not
                      immediately followed by setting the checked variable to the opposite boolean value.
                Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
                The reachable functions are ['init', 'setFarmingSetups']
                    Function Security Analysis for FarmMain.init(address,bytes,address,address,bytes)
                        There are no modifiers should be examined in function init.
                        Check direct function security
                            - function FarmMain.init(address,bytes,address,address,bytes) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                              Reason: This function does not contain any of the specified structures that involve checking if msg.sender is equal to or not equal to a
                              specific owner, address, leader, or CEO.
                            - function FarmMain.init(address,bytes,address,address,bytes) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                              Reason: The provided code does not match any of the required structures. There is no 'require(xxx == True); xxx = False;' or similar pattern
                              accessible from the characteristics provided.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
