    Check direct function security
        - function PriceChecker._updatePrice() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not include any of the structures listed: 1. 'require', 2. 'if (msg.sender != ...)', 3. 'if (msg.sender != ...) throw;', or 4. 'assert'.
        - function PriceChecker._updatePrice() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: There is no 'require(xxx == True)', 'require(xxx == False)', 'require(!xxx)', or 'if(!xxx) throw;' statement followed by a change of 'xxx' to 'False' or
          'True'.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['updatePrice', 'constructor', 'constructor']
        Function Security Analysis for PriceChecker.updatePrice()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function updatePrice.
            Check direct function security
                - function PriceChecker.updatePrice() has security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The code uses 'require(msg.sender == priceCheckerAddress);', satisfying the first structure where 'require' checks 'msg.sender' directly against
                  'priceCheckerAddress', which is not a local variable context as described in the note. The note does not apply here because 'priceCheckerAddress' is not
                  prefixed by a local variable 'xxx'.
        Function Security Analysis for PriceChecker.constructor(address)
            This is a constructor.
        Function Security Analysis for FidaSale.constructor(string,address,address,address,address,address,address,string,string)
            This is a constructor.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
