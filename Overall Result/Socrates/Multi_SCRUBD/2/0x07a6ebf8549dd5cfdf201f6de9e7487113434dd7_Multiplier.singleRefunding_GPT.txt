Function Security Analysis for Multiplier.singleRefunding()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function singleRefunding.
    Check direct function security
        - function Multiplier.singleRefunding() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not have any of the specified structures: it lacks any require/assert statements or conditional checks on msg.sender.
        - function Multiplier.singleRefunding() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures involving 'require' or 'if' statements with variable assignments as mentioned in the given
          characteristics. There are no 'require' or 'if' statements performing checks and assignments on the same boolean variable before and after the statements
          according to the rules provided.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['fallback']
        Function Security Analysis for Multiplier.fallback()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
            Check direct function security
                - function Multiplier.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain any conditional checks or assertions comparing msg.sender specifically to an xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO. It uses
                  msg.sender in other contexts but none of the ones specified.
                - function Multiplier.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: Upon reviewing the code again, the part `require(!isContract(msg.sender));` is present, fulfilling part of the structure 3 requirement, which is
                  `require(!xxx);`. However, there is no corresponding `isContract(msg.sender) = True;` or equivalent assignment to match the structure fully. Therefore,
                  it does not meet the full requirement of the specified pattern, as only the `require` statement is present without the subsequent variable assignment to
                  `True`.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['dep.depositor.send(amount)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - dep.depositor.send(amount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the '.send('
        keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
