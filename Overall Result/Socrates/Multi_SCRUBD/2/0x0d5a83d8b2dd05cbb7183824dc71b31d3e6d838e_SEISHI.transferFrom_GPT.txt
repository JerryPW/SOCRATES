Function Security Analysis for SEISHI.transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function transferFrom.
    Check direct function security
        - function SEISHI.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not have any access control checks for specific roles like xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO using msg.sender, nor does it throw/assert
          in such a context.
        - function SEISHI.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures. The require statement in the function is checking for a condition related to the
          allowance for a transfer, and there is no assignment to the same variable that follows the require statement that matches the specified patterns.

    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _transfer.
    Check direct function security
        - function SEISHI._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any checks involving 'msg.sender', specifically it doesn't fall into any provided categories related to ownership checks or
          require/assert statements involving 'msg.sender'. All conditions involve addresses and flags not related to 'msg.sender'.
        - function SEISHI._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not satisfy any of the four specified structures because it doesn't contain the specific sequences of require and assignment statements as
          described. The logic involving 'require' statements in the code does not match the patterns given.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transferFrom', 'transfer']
        Function Security Analysis for SEISHI.transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transferFrom.
            Check direct function security
                - function SEISHI.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not include any statements that check if `msg.sender` is equal or not equal to any specified 'xxxOwner', 'xxxAddress', 'Leader',
                  or 'CEO'. It does not meet any of the structures that check for a specific ownership or role validation through `msg.sender`.
                - function SEISHI.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the required structures. It only checks a condition with 'require' and updates allowances without altering a
                  boolean variable directly related to the require check.

Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: SEISHI.swapForTokenomics(uint256)
Function Security Analysis for SEISHI.swapForTokenomics(uint256)
    The modifier of function swapForTokenomics are ['lockTheSwap']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier lockTheSwap is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: Upon reviewing the modifier 'lockTheSwap', it structure comprises both setting 'inSwapAndLiquify = true;' at the beginning and 'inSwapAndLiquify =
          false;' at the end, correctly implementing a lock operation. This matches the criteria for structure 2.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
