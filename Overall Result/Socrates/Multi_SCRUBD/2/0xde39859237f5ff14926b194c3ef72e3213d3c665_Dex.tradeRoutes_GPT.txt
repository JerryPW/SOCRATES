Function Security Analysis for Dex.tradeRoutes(ERC20,uint256,ERC20,uint256,address[])
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function tradeRoutes.
    Check direct function security
        - function Dex.tradeRoutes(ERC20,uint256,ERC20,uint256,address[]) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified permission checks related to msg.sender, as there are no require/assert statements checking if msg.sender
          is an owner, CEO or similar role.
        - function Dex.tradeRoutes(ERC20,uint256,ERC20,uint256,address[]) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the required patterns specified. There are 'assert' statements, but they are used for checking conditions and
          are not changing the state of any variables like in the described patterns.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['src.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),srcAmount)', 'msg.sender.send(destAmount)', 'dest.transfer(msg.sender,destAmount)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - msg.sender.send(destAmount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        'msg.sender.send(destAmount)' contains the '.send(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - dest.transfer(msg.sender,destAmount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - src.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),srcAmount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - dest.transfer(msg.sender,destAmount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['src.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),srcAmount)', 'dest.transfer(msg.sender,destAmount)']
    Analyze External Address
        The variable 'src' in external call 'src.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),srcAmount)' has no state variable assigned in
        Dex.tradeRoutes(ERC20,uint256,ERC20,uint256,address[]). Therefore we check whether it has been hardcoded in the function.
            No The variable 'src' is not hardcoded in the provided function. It is passed as a parameter to the function `tradeRoutes` and can have different values each
            time the function is called, depending on what is passed into it externally.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
