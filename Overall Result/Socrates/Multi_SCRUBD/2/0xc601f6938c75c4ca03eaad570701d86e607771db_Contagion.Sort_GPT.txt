Start analyze function: Contagion.Sort()
Function Security Analysis for Contagion.Sort()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function Sort.
    Check direct function security
        - function Contagion.Sort() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any 'require', 'if', or 'assert' statements with conditions directly involving 'msg.sender' compared to
          'xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO'.
        - function Contagion.Sort() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function does not contain any 'require' statements or conditional logic involving variables being set directly after a check, fitting the given
          structures. It primarily deals with transaction handling without such checks.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['fallback']
        Function Security Analysis for Contagion.fallback()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
            Check direct function security
                - function Contagion.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not perform any checks against msg.sender being a specific owner or role such as xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
                - function Contagion.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The function does not meet any of the specified structures: it contains `require(msg.value>=0.01 ether);` which is not checking for a boolean
                  variable set to True or False, and there's no subsequent setting of such a variable.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['owner.send(feecounter)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - owner.send(feecounter) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the '.send('
        keyword which satisfies rule 2.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
