Function Security Analysis for GAME.startRaffle(uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function startRaffle.
    Check direct function security
        - function GAME.startRaffle(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified patterns that would require a check on msg.sender against xxxOwner or similar roles.
        - function GAME.startRaffle(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code contains `require(ticketsBought == ticketPool);` but lacks the corresponding assignment `ticketsBought = False;` or `ticketPool = False;` after
          it, which are necessary for it to fit into the defined characteristics. Also, there is no sequence that fulfills the structures defined in the prompt using
          true/false variable toggling.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

                - function usingOraclize.__callback(bytes32,string) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The provided code does not contain any conditions or assertions involving 'msg.sender' related to ownership or specific roles like Owner,
                  Leader, CEO, etc. Therefore, it does not match any of the specified structures.
                - function usingOraclize.__callback(bytes32,string) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code provided does not include any 'require' statement or 'if' statement with 'throw'. It lacks the pattern of changing the state of a
                  boolean variable based on a precondition check. None of the specified structures (1 to 4) are present in this function.

    Check direct function security
        - function GAME.fillFromQueue() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not include any permissions checks involving msg.sender, such as require or if statements checking against
          xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
        - function GAME.fillFromQueue() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not include any usage of the `require` statement or the specific conditional checks involving `xxx` as per the defined structures.
          It primarily manages purchasing logic for tickets and deals with queue processing, without requiring or throwing based on conditions formatted as `require(xxx
          == True)` / `require(xxx == False)` / `require(!xxx)`. The code is structured around processing conditions without explicit `require` or `if(!xxx) throw`

                  use 'assert' for checking. It only contains a function call.
                - function usingOraclize.__callback(bytes32,string) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The function's code does not include any 'require', '!', or 'if' statements with a boolean variable being negated or checked against 'True' or

        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            Yes 1. The function is named 'GAME', which matches the contract name 'GAME', thus indicating it is a constructor function. 2. The state variable 'token' is
            being assigned in the function without a hardcoded value but from another state variable or parameter. However, since the function matches the constructor
            naming, it satisfies the requirement based on the constructor rule alone.
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            Yes 1. The function name 'GAME' matches the contract name 'GAME', indicating that this code is a constructor. The code is setting up initial parameters and
            configurations for the contract deployment. 2. The function references the state variable 'token' by setting it with 'AwardsTokensInterface(_BONUS)', but
            there is no hardcoded value for 'token'. The value is derived from the input parameter '_BONUS', which means this condition of hardcoding is not satisfied.
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            Yes 1. The function name 'GAME' matches the contract name 'GAME', thus indicating it's a constructor. 2. The function does not hardcode the state variable
            'token', though it assigns the state variable 'token' from the '_BONUS' passed as a parameter converted via 'AwardsTokensInterface'.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier oraclizeAPI has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier `oraclizeAPI` doesn't enforce any owner or specific addresses can execute the function, nor does it implement a lock mechanism. It sets
          network-related addresses and does not restrict access based on specific caller identities. Additionally, based on the modifier name, there is no indication of

        - function usingOraclize.oraclize_query(string,bytes[],uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.

        - oraclize.queryN_withGasLimit.value(price)(0,datasource,args,gaslimit) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Here is the reason: Since the code section is empty (`Code:
        []`), there are no operations nor assignments to modify the value of the provided variable `gaslimit`. Without any operations or assignments, we cannot assess
        whether `gaslimit` is always less than or equal to 3000.  In programming, unless explicitly set or assumed, variables have undefined values. Therefore, without an
        initial assignment or context that provides a default value (e.g., a description indicating a default assignment), or any operations applied to it within a code,
        we cannot definitively conclude the state of `gaslimit` in the context presented.   However, given standard conventions, if `gaslimit` has not been set
        explicitly, we cannot assume it meets any specific criteria, such as being less than or equal to 3000. Hence, the answer defaults to False since we lack
        information confirming that `gaslimit` is less than or equal to 3000.

                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the structures listed. There is no use of 'require' or an 'if' condition with a variable 'xxx' followed by
                  setting 'xxx = True' or variations thereof. The code focuses on managing a ticket purchase and queueing process, evaluating conditions but not using the
                  specific patterns mentioned.
            Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
            The reachable functions are ['fillFromQueue', '__callback', '__callback', 'startRaffle']
                Function Security Analysis for usingOraclize.__callback(bytes32,string)
                    There are no modifiers should be examined in function __callback.
                    Check direct function security
                        - function usingOraclize.__callback(bytes32,string) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                          Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified permission check patterns involving msg.sender.
                        - function usingOraclize.__callback(bytes32,string) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                          Reason: The function does not contain any 'require' statements checking a boolean variable, nor does it throw an exception based on a boolean
                          condition, nor modify a boolean variable as described in any of the expected structures.
External Call Analysis

    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
