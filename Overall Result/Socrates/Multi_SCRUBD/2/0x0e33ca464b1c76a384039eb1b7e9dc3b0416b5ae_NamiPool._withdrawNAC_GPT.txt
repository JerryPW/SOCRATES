Function Security Analysis for NamiPool._withdrawNAC(address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _withdrawNAC.
    Check direct function security
        - function NamiPool._withdrawNAC(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures that relate to checking msg.sender against any owner or leader identifiers.
        - function NamiPool._withdrawNAC(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures. It has a `require` statement, but it does not set the variable to False or True afterwards.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['withdrawNonTop', 'withdrawTopForTeam', 'withdrawTop', 'withdrawNonTopForTeam']
        Function Security Analysis for NamiPool.withdrawNonTop(uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function withdrawNonTop.
            Check direct function security
                - function NamiPool.withdrawNonTop(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function includes no checks against msg.sender being a specific owner, address, or role like Leader/CEO. It only checks the state of certain
                  conditions and the user's active or withdrawal status.
                - function NamiPool.withdrawNonTop(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: Upon reevaluation, the prior assessment was incorrect. The code does not contain a complete structure as described in requirements 1 through 4.
                  Specifically, for requirement 1, a matching `require(xxx == True);` and `xxx = False;` combination isn't observed. Similarly, for requirements 2, 3, and
                  4, while the `require(namiPool[_roundIndex][msg.sender].isActive == false);` line is identified, there is no corresponding
                  `namiPool[_roundIndex][msg.sender].isActive = True;` within the same structural guidelines.  Thus, none of the conditions outlined in the instructions
                  are met completely and correctly.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['namiToken.balanceOf(this)', 'namiToken.transfer(_shareAddress,namiPool[_roundIndex][_shareAddress].stake)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - namiToken.transfer(_shareAddress,namiPool[_roundIndex][_shareAddress].stake) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - namiToken.balanceOf(this) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - namiToken.transfer(_shareAddress,namiPool[_roundIndex][_shareAddress].stake) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['namiToken.balanceOf(this)', 'namiToken.transfer(_shareAddress,namiPool[_roundIndex][_shareAddress].stake)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['NamiAddr'] should be checked in variable namiToken
        Checked variables: NamiAddr
            Yes The function 'NamiPool' provided in the code matches the contract name 'NamiPool', which indicates that this function is a constructor. Therefore, it
            satisfies the first characteristic outlined.
        There are ['NamiAddr'] should be checked in variable namiToken
        Checked variables: NamiAddr
            Yes The function is a constructor because it has the same name as the contract, NamiPool. This satisfies characteristic 1.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
