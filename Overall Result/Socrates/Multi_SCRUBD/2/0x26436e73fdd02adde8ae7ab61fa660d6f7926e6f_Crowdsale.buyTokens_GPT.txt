Function Security Analysis for Crowdsale.buyTokens(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function buyTokens.
    Check direct function security
        - function Crowdsale.buyTokens(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures involving msg.sender. It only checks for the validity of beneficiary and performs actions
          related to token purchase and transfers.
        - function Crowdsale.buyTokens(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function does not contain any variable statements such as 'xxx = true' or 'xxx = false', nor any of the specific patterns mentioned. The require
          statements in the function do not check for a boolean variable directly, but rather compare the beneficiary to address(0) and call validPurchase(), none of
          which match the specified patterns.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['token.transfer(beneficiary,tokens)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - token.transfer(beneficiary,tokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - token.transfer(beneficiary,tokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['token.transfer(beneficiary,tokens)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            Yes The function name 'Crowdsale' matches the contract name 'Crowdsale', indicating it is a constructor. Additionally, the state variable 'token' is being
            hardcoded with a specific address value for the 'Token Contract Address'. Hence, it satisfies both characteristic 1 and characteristic 2.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: Crowdsale.forwardFunds()
Function Security Analysis for Crowdsale.forwardFunds()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function forwardFunds.
    Check direct function security
        - function Crowdsale.forwardFunds() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The given code does not contain any of the specified structures involving `msg.sender`.
        - function Crowdsale.forwardFunds() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not contain any statements with require(xxx == True), require(xxx == False), require(!xxx), or if(!xxx) throw patterns, nor any
          explicit variable assignments like xxx = True or xxx = False. It only performs a wallet transfer operation.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['buyTokens', 'fallback']
        Function Security Analysis for Crowdsale.buyTokens(address)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function buyTokens.
            Check direct function security
                - function Crowdsale.buyTokens(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: None of the conditions match the required patterns involving msg.sender with roles like Owner, Address, Leader, or CEO.
                - function Crowdsale.buyTokens(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures where a variable is required to be either true or false, then flipped to the
                  opposite within the function.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['wallet.transfer(msg.value)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - wallet.transfer(msg.value) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the keyword
        '.transfer('.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
