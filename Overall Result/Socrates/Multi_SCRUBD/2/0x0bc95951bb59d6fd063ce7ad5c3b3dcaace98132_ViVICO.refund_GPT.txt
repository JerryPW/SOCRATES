Function Security Analysis for ViVICO.refund()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function refund.
    Check direct function security
        - function ViVICO.refund() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code uses require(level[msg.sender] >= 2) which restricts access based on sender's level instead of explicitly checking against
          Owner/Address/Leader/CEO.
        - function ViVICO.refund() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code contains the statement `require(state == State.Failed);`, followed by a series of condition checks and operations. The state
          assignment altering the state variable, `state = True` or `state = False`, doesn't appear in the code, as those operations focus mainly on refund logic and
          state checks like clearing balances and enabling refunds. Therefore, there's only an initial require check but it doesn't fulfill the required pattern
          altogether.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['tokenReward.transfer(creator,remanent)', 'creator.transfer(address(this).balance)', 'msg.sender.transfer(holderETH)',
    'tokenReward.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),holderTokens)', 'tokenReward.balanceOf(this)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - tokenReward.transfer(creator,remanent) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - creator.transfer(address(this).balance) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains
        the '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - msg.sender.transfer(holderETH) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the
        '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - tokenReward.transfer(creator,remanent) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - tokenReward.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),holderTokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - tokenReward.balanceOf(this) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['tokenReward.transfer(creator,remanent)', 'tokenReward.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),holderTokens)', 'tokenReward.balanceOf(this)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['tokenReward'] should be checked in variable tokenReward
        Checked variables: tokenReward
            Yes The function provided is a constructor, as evident by its name 'constructor'. In Solidity, constructors are special functions executed during contract
            deployment, and they typically have the name 'constructor' or match the contract name (ViVICO in this case). Additionally, it initializes the state variable
            'tokenReward', but the value is not hardcoded since it takes '_addressOfTokenUsedAsReward' as a parameter.
        There are ['tokenReward'] should be checked in variable tokenReward
        Checked variables: tokenReward
            Yes The provided code for the function is named 'constructor', indicating that it is the constructor of the contract ViVICO. Constructors are used for initial
            setup when the contract is deployed, fitting the first characteristic.
        There are ['tokenReward'] should be checked in variable tokenReward
        Checked variables: tokenReward
            Yes The provided code contains a constructor function, which is evident from the function being explicitly named 'constructor'. Constructors automatically
            match the contract name or are explicitly labeled as 'constructor'. Therefore, this code satisfies condition 1.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
