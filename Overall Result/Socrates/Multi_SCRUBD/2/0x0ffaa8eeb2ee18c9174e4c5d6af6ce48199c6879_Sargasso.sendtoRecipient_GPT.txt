    Check direct function security
        - function Sargasso.sendtoRecipient(uint256,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures related to 'msg.sender'.
        - function Sargasso.sendtoRecipient(uint256,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.

            Check direct function security
                - function Sargasso.specialdeposit(uint256,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not perform any checks related to the identity of msg.sender against specific roles like xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO.
                - function Sargasso.specialdeposit(uint256,uint256) has security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The negation operation 'userLock[msg.sender] = true;' immediately follows the 'require(userLock[msg.sender] == false);' check, and this change
                  of state occurs before the main logic (pool updates, balance checks, etc.) of the function proceeds.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
