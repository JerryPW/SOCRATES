Function Security Analysis for Depot.exchangeSynthsForSynthetix(uint256)
    The modifier of function exchangeSynthsForSynthetix are ['pricesNotStale', 'notPaused']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier pricesNotStale has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier 'pricesNotStale' does not enforce owner or specific address execution, nor does it use lock operations. It's checking for staleness of
          prices instead.
        - modifier notPaused has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier checks if the contract is paused but does not include any address-specific checks or lock operations. It doesn't follow any characteristics
          listed in rules 1, 2, or 3.
    Check direct function security
        - function Depot.exchangeSynthsForSynthetix(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures.
        - function Depot.exchangeSynthsForSynthetix(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified patterns where a variable is checked with 'require' or 'if...throw' and then changed immediately
          afterwards.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['synthetix.transfer(msg.sender,synthetixToSend)', 'synth.transferFrom(msg.sender,fundsWallet,synthAmount)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - synthetix.transfer(msg.sender,synthetixToSend) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - synthetix.transfer(msg.sender,synthetixToSend) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - synth.transferFrom(msg.sender,fundsWallet,synthAmount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['synthetix.transfer(msg.sender,synthetixToSend)', 'synth.transferFrom(msg.sender,fundsWallet,synthAmount)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['synthetix'] should be checked in variable synthetix
        Checked variables: synthetix
            Yes The provided code includes a constructor function that initializes several state variables for the contract. The function is identified as a constructor
            either by using the name 'constructor' directly in the code or by matching the name with the contract name, which satisfies characteristic 1.
        There are ['synth'] should be checked in variable synth
        Checked variables: synth
            Yes The code contains a constructor function, which is indicated by the function named 'constructor'. This matches one of the characteristics we are checking
            for. However, the external function 'setSynth(Synth _synth)' modifies a state variable, synth, but does not have it hardcoded. Therefore, it satisfies the
            first characteristic but not the second.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: Depot.synthetixReceivedForSynths(uint256)
Function Security Analysis for Depot.synthetixReceivedForSynths(uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function synthetixReceivedForSynths.
    Check direct function security
        - function Depot.synthetixReceivedForSynths(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code provided does not use any structure involving `msg.sender`, which means it doesn't fit any of the four specified patterns based on the
          `msg.sender` variable.
        - function Depot.synthetixReceivedForSynths(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided function SynthetixReceivedForSynths does not contain any of the specified structures. It simply calculates and returns a value based on a
          fee and price conversion, lacking both require statements and if-throw logic as outlined in the criteria.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['feePool.amountReceivedFromTransfer(amount)']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - feePool.amountReceivedFromTransfer(amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['feePool.amountReceivedFromTransfer(amount)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['feePool'] should be checked in variable feePool
        Checked variables: feePool
            Yes The provided code is a constructor as it either matches the contract name 'Depot' or is explicitly named 'constructor'.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
