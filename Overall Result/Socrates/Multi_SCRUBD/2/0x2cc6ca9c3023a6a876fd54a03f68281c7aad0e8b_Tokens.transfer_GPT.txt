          specific addresses, in line with Rule 1, as it ensures only those addresses can bypass the time lock. Although it is not a direct check of ownership, it
          effectively restricts access based on specific criteria, which is aligned with the enforcement of access control through specific addresses.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
