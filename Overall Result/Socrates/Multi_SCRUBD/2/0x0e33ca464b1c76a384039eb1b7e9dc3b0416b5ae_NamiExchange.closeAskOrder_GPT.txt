Function Security Analysis for NamiExchange.closeAskOrder()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function closeAskOrder.
    Check direct function security
        - function NamiExchange.closeAskOrder() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not include any condition that requires or checks if msg.sender equals a specific owner or address directly. It involves checking
          conditions related to msg.sender's ask order, but not ownership-related checks as stated in the given criteria.
        - function NamiExchange.closeAskOrder() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain the required structures. It uses a 'require' statement to enforce a condition and an 'assert' to check balance, but none of
          the specified structures outlined in the prompt are present.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['namiToken.transfer(msg.sender,ask[msg.sender].volume)', 'namiToken.balanceOf(msg.sender)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - namiToken.transfer(msg.sender,ask[msg.sender].volume) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - namiToken.transfer(msg.sender,ask[msg.sender].volume) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - namiToken.balanceOf(msg.sender) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['namiToken.transfer(msg.sender,ask[msg.sender].volume)', 'namiToken.balanceOf(msg.sender)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['NamiAddr'] should be checked in variable namiToken
        Checked variables: NamiAddr
            Yes The provided code contains a function named 'NamiExchange', which matches the contract name 'NamiExchange'. This indicates that the function is a
            constructor of the contract.
        There are ['NamiAddr'] should be checked in variable namiToken
        Checked variables: NamiAddr
            Yes The function name 'NamiExchange' matches the contract name 'NamiExchange', indicating that this is a constructor function in older versions of Solidity
            (before 0.4.22). Constructors are special functions and are not considered normal external call functions as they are only called once, during the deployment
            of the contract. Hence, this satisfies the first characteristic.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
