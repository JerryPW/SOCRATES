    Analyze External Address
        The variable 'tokenMapped' in external call 'InitializableProductProxy(address(tokenMapped)).__InitializableProductProxy_init(address(this),_TokenMapped_,abi.enco
        deWithSignature(__TokenMapped_init(address,address),address(this),token))' has no state variable assigned in MappingTokenFactory.createTokenMapped(address).
        Therefore we check whether it has been hardcoded in the function.
            No The variable `tokenMapped` is not hardcoded. It is assigned a value dynamically based on the result of the `create2` assembly instruction, which depends on
            the `salt` and other input parameters. Additionally, `tokenMapped` is designated as a return value, indicating that it is determined at runtime rather than
            being hardcoded.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
