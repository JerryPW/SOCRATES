Function Security Analysis for FarmMain._mintFarmTokenAmount(address,uint256,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _mintFarmTokenAmount.
    Check direct function security
        - function FarmMain._mintFarmTokenAmount(address,uint256,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures involving msg.sender.
        - function FarmMain._mintFarmTokenAmount(address,uint256,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures. It's a minting function that checks if an objectId is 0 and mints tokens accordingly, but it
          does not involve specific variable assignments meeting the criteria.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['openPosition']
        Function Security Analysis for FarmMain.openPosition(FarmingPositionRequest)
            The modifier of function openPosition are ['activeSetupOnly']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier activeSetupOnly has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The provided modifier checks for conditions related to the activity status and timing of a setup, without any explicit owner check or lock
                  mechanism.\nThis modifier does not enforce execution restrictions based on msg.sender or lock execution to ensure single entry.
            Check direct function security
                - function FarmMain.openPosition(FarmingPositionRequest) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The provided function does not contain any require, if, or assert statements that check or apply conditions specifically involving `msg.sender`
                  against 'Owner', 'Address', 'Leader', or 'CEO'. Hence, it does not match any of the specified structures.
                - function FarmMain.openPosition(FarmingPositionRequest) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any structure that involves changing the same boolean variable after a require statement and aligns with the specified
                  patterns.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['INativeV1(_farmTokenCollection).mint(amount,string(abi.encodePacked(FarmingLP,_toString(_setupsInfo[_setups[setupIndex].infoIndex].liquidityPo

        - INativeV1(_farmTokenCollection).mint(amount,string(abi.encodePacked(FarmingLP,_toString(_setupsInfo[_setups[setupIndex].infoIndex].liquidityPoolTokenAddress))),
        fLP,IFarmFactory(_factory).getFarmTokenURI(),true) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['INativeV1(_farmTokenCollection).mint(amount,string(abi.encodePacked(FarmingLP,_toString(_setupsInfo[_setups[setupIndex].infoIndex].liquidit
    yPoolTokenAddress))),fLP,IFarmFactory(_factory).getFarmTokenURI(),true)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['_farmTokenCollection'] should be checked in variable _farmTokenCollection
        Checked variables: _farmTokenCollection
            Yes The function named 'init' does not match the contract name 'FarmMain', nor is it explicitly named 'constructor'. Therefore, it is not a constructor.
            However, the function does involve the state variable '_farmTokenCollection', which is hardcoded and assigned a value within the function via a call to
            'IEthItemOrchestrator'. Thus, this function satisfies the second characteristic.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
