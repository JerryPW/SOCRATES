    There are no modifiers should be examined in function swapAndShare.
    Check direct function security
        - function MessierAnonymity.swapAndShare() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any checks or assertions involving msg.sender to verify ownership or specific address permission before execution.
        - function MessierAnonymity.swapAndShare() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures. It uses require statements and conditionals but does not perform boolean assignments as
          outlined in the template.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['deposit', 'forceSwapAndShare']
        Function Security Analysis for MessierAnonymity.deposit(bytes32)
            The modifier of function deposit are ['nonReentrant']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier nonReentrant is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The nonReentrant modifier uses a counter to establish a lock/unlock mechanism:  1. `_guardCounter += 1;` represents the lock operation by
                  incrementing the counter. 2. `require(localCounter == _guardCounter, "ReentrancyGuard: reentrant call");` checks if the counter value has not been
                  altered during the execution, serving as the unlock verification.  Both elements of the lock mechanism are present, satisfying the characteristics of
                  rule 2.
        Function Security Analysis for MessierAnonymity.forceSwapAndShare()
            The modifier of function forceSwapAndShare are ['onlyOwner']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The code snippet in the modifier onlyOwner enforces that only the owner can execute the function, as evidenced by the statement
                  require(msg.sender == messier_owner, which matches Rule 1. There is no indication of lock and unlock operations present to satisfy Rule 2. Hence, Rule 1
                  is still valid for this modifier.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
