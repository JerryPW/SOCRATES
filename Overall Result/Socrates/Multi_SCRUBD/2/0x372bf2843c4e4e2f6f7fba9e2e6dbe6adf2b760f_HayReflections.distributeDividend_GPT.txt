Function Security Analysis for HayReflections.distributeDividend(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function distributeDividend.
    Check direct function security
        - function HayReflections.distributeDividend(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not have any access control checks involving 'msg.sender' related to specific roles like owner, admin, or addresses. It only operates
          conditionally on 'shareholder' and their shares without involving 'msg.sender'.
        - function HayReflections.distributeDividend(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code checks if the amount of shares for a shareholder is zero and returns if true. It does not match any of the required patterns that check
          or require a boolean variable to be true or false, and then assigning them to the opposite value.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['setShare', 'gibTokens', 'process']
        Function Security Analysis for HayReflections.setShare(address,uint256)
            The modifier of function setShare are ['onlyToken']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyToken is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The code in the modifier enforces that only a specific address ('_token') can execute the function with 'require(msg.sender == _token);'.
                  Therefore, it matches the first characteristic of checking sender's address to restrict function execution. There are no lock/unlock operations
                  indicating the second structure.
        Function Security Analysis for HayReflections.gibTokens(address)
            The modifier of function gibTokens are ['onlyToken']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyToken is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The judgment is based on the rule that the code enforces only a specific address (_token) can execute the function using 'require(msg.sender ==
                  _token);'. Therefore, it satisfies condition 1.
        Function Security Analysis for HayReflections.process(uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function process.
            Check direct function security
                - function HayReflections.process(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain any conditions or assertions involving 'msg.sender' that check for specific roles like Owner, Address, Leader, or CEO.
                - function HayReflections.process(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not have a 'require' statement, nor does it have the '!xxx' or 'throw' structure as described in the patterns provided.

    Analyze External Address
        There are ['HAY'] should be checked in variable HAY
        Checked variables: HAY
            Yes The function in the provided code is named 'constructor', which matches the criteria for detecting a constructor.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
