Function Security Analysis for PunkMonkeyDividendTracker._reinvestDividendOfUser(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _reinvestDividendOfUser.
    Check direct function security
        - function PunkMonkeyDividendTracker._reinvestDividendOfUser(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not have any checks involving 'msg.sender' against 'xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO'. Instead, it focuses on financial transactions and
          error handling within a private function without sender authentication logic.
        - function PunkMonkeyDividendTracker._reinvestDividendOfUser(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function code does not contain any of the specified structures required for a 'Yes'. It does not involve require or if statements directly related
          to setting a boolean variable as per the given structures.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['processAccount', 'process']
        Function Security Analysis for PunkMonkeyDividendTracker.processAccount(address,bool)
            The modifier of function processAccount are ['onlyOwner']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The code enforces that only the owner can execute the function by using 'require(_owner == _msgSender())'. This satisfies rule 1 as it ensures
                  the function can only be executed by the owner.
        Function Security Analysis for PunkMonkeyDividendTracker.process(uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function process.
            Check direct function security
                - function PunkMonkeyDividendTracker.process(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures related to 'msg.sender'. It does not have any requirements, checks, or assertions
                  comparing 'msg.sender' to an owner/address/leader/CEO.
                - function PunkMonkeyDividendTracker.process(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The given code does not contain any 'require' statements or use negation in the form of '!'. It utilizes conditional checks without modifying
                  boolean variables in the specified manner. There's no code pattern as described in the provided structures 1-4, such as 'require(xxx == True)',
                  'require(xxx == False)', 'require(!xxx)', or 'if(!xxx) throw'. Therefore, none of the conditions for outputting 'Yes' are met.

    Analyze External Address
        There are ['PunkMonkeyContract'] should be checked in variable PunkMonkeyContract
        Checked variables: PunkMonkeyContract
            Yes The function given in the code is explicitly a constructor because it is named 'constructor'. Constructors are special functions in solidity that share
            the name with the contract or have 'constructor' as the name and are run once at the time of contract deployment. Since this function is named 'constructor',
            it satisfies characteristic 1.  Additionally, the state variable 'PunkMonkeyContract' is hardcoded inside this constructor. It's being set with
            'PunkMonkey(mainContract)', hence satisfying characteristic 2.
        There are ['uniswapV2Router'] should be checked in variable uniswapV2Router
        Checked variables: uniswapV2Router
            Yes The code contains a constructor function because its name is explicitly 'constructor', matching the requirement for characteristic 1. Characteristic 2 is
            not met as the state variable 'uniswapV2Router' is assigned from a parameter in the constructor, but is not hardcoded.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
