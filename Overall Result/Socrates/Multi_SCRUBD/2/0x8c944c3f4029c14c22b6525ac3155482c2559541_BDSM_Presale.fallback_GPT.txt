Function Security Analysis for BDSM_Presale.fallback()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
    Check direct function security
        - function BDSM_Presale.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not include any of the listed structures involving msg.sender with specific roles like Owner/Address/Leader/CEO.
        - function BDSM_Presale.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon reviewing the code, the structure 'require(xxx == True); xxx = False;' does not fully appear in the code. The relevant `require(tokenToBuy > 0);`
          line does not have a corresponding `xxx = False;` statement for the same variable. The changes to `presaleClosed` do not align directly with those required by
          the specified criteria. Additionally, there is no pattern like 'require(xxx == False); xxx = True;' or 'require(!xxx); xxx = True;' or 'if(!xxx) throw; xxx =
          true;'. Therefore, none of the specified structures are present in the code.

    Analyze Transfer
        - sharesTokenAddress.transfer(msg.sender,tokenFree) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - msg.sender.transfer(msg.value-sendETH) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        'msg.sender.transfer(msg.value-sendETH)' contains '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - owner.transfer(actualETHTransfer) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        'owner.transfer(actualETHTransfer)' contains '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - sharesTokenAddress.transfer(msg.sender,tokenToBuy) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - msg.sender.transfer(msg.value-actualETHTransfer) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        'msg.sender.transfer(msg.value-actualETHTransfer)' contains '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - owner.transfer(sendETH) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call 'owner.transfer(sendETH)'
        contains '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - msg.sender.transfer(msg.value) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        'msg.sender.transfer(msg.value)' contains '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - sharesTokenAddress.transfer(safeContract,sharesTokenAddress.balanceOf(this)) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - sharesTokenAddress.balanceOf(this) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - sharesTokenAddress.transfer(msg.sender,tokenFree) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - sharesTokenAddress.transfer(msg.sender,tokenToBuy) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - sharesTokenAddress.transfer(safeContract,sharesTokenAddress.balanceOf(this)) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['sharesTokenAddress.balanceOf(this)', 'sharesTokenAddress.transfer(msg.sender,tokenFree)',
    'sharesTokenAddress.transfer(msg.sender,tokenToBuy)', 'sharesTokenAddress.transfer(safeContract,sharesTokenAddress.balanceOf(this))']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['sharesTokenAddress'] should be checked in variable sharesTokenAddress
        Checked variables: sharesTokenAddress
            Yes The function name 'BDSM_Presale' matches the contract name 'BDSM_Presale', indicating it is likely a constructor.
        There are ['sharesTokenAddress'] should be checked in variable sharesTokenAddress
        Checked variables: sharesTokenAddress
            Yes 1. The function is named 'BDSM_Presale', which matches the contract name, indicating that it is a constructor. 2. The function also assigns a value to the
            state variable 'sharesTokenAddress', fulfilling the second characteristic of hardcoding the provided state variable.
        There are ['sharesTokenAddress'] should be checked in variable sharesTokenAddress
        Checked variables: sharesTokenAddress
            Yes The function named 'BDSM_Presale' matches the contract name 'BDSM_Presale', indicating that this code is a constructor. Constructors are special functions
            called only once when a contract is created, and they usually have the same name as the contract in older Solidity versions, or are explicitly termed
            'constructor' in newer versions. Hence, the function satisfies the first characteristic, marking it as a constructor.
        There are ['sharesTokenAddress'] should be checked in variable sharesTokenAddress
        Checked variables: sharesTokenAddress
            Yes The provided code is a constructor because the function name matches the contract name 'BDSM_Presale'.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
