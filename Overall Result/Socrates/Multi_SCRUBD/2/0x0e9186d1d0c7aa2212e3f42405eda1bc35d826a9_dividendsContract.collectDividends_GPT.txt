Function Security Analysis for dividendsContract.collectDividends(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function collectDividends.
    Check direct function security
        - function dividendsContract.collectDividends(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code uses 'require(msg.sender == member && dc.endDate() < now);', but 'member' is a parameter and does not fit the specific ownership roles such as
          xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO from the guidelines provided for structure 1.
        - function dividendsContract.collectDividends(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any require statements or conditional statements that manipulate a boolean value as per the given structures.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['member.transfer(payout)', 'dc.endDate()', 'dc.balanceOf(member)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - member.transfer(payout) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the '.transfer('
        keyword, satisfying the characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - dc.endDate() ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - dc.balanceOf(member) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['dc.endDate()', 'dc.balanceOf(member)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['dc'] should be checked in variable dc
        Checked variables: dc
            No The function named "ICOaddress" is not a constructor because it doesn't match the contract name "dividendsContract" and is not explicitly named
            "constructor". The function modifies the state variable "dc" by assigning it a new value using the input parameter "_t" with the expression
            "Ethernational(_t)". This is not a hardcoded value since it depends on the function argument.
            Function Security Analysis for dividendsContract.ICOaddress(address)
                The modifier of function ICOaddress are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The code contains the statement `require(msg.sender == owner);`, which explicitly checks that the function caller is the owner. This
                      satisfies rule 1, which looks for structures that enforce the function to be executable only by an owner or specific address. This is the only
                      statement in the modifier, and thus there are no structural omissions.
        There are ['dc'] should be checked in variable dc
        Checked variables: dc
            No The function provided, 'ICOaddress', does not match the name of the contract, 'dividendsContract', nor is it explicitly named 'constructor'. Thus, it
            cannot be considered a constructor. Additionally, the state variable 'dc' is set in the function but not with a hardcoded value; instead, it is assigned based
            on the '_t' parameter passed to the function and a subsequent function call on '_t'. Therefore, the code does not satisfy either of the specified
            characteristics.
            Function Security Analysis for dividendsContract.ICOaddress(address)
                The modifier of function ICOaddress are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The initial judgment remains correct. The code contains the statement 'require(msg.sender == owner);', which ensures that only the owner can
                      execute the function. This satisfies the first characteristic, confirming the code is enforcing ownership restriction. There are no omissions as the
                      requirement aligns entirely with characteristic one.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
