Function Security Analysis for OpportyWhiteListHold.unlockTokens()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function unlockTokens.
    Check direct function security
        - function OpportyWhiteListHold.unlockTokens() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code checks the requirements without a direct comparison to a specific owner or address such as xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO as described in the
          given patterns.
        - function OpportyWhiteListHold.unlockTokens() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: In the code, after the require statement checking '!holderList[msg.sender].withdrawed', the operation holderList[msg.sender].withdrawed = true; is
          performed after the OppToken.transfer() and not immediately after the require statement. This means that the negation is not completed before the main logic
          executes, which is transferring tokens. Thus, it does not satisfy the requirement of immediate negation after state check.

    Analyze Transfer
        - OppToken.transfer(msg.sender,holderList[msg.sender].tokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - OppToken.transfer(msg.sender,holderList[msg.sender].tokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['OppToken.transfer(msg.sender,holderList[msg.sender].tokens)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['OppToken'] should be checked in variable OppToken
        Checked variables: OppToken
            No The function `setToken` does not match the contract name `OpportyWhiteListHold` and is not named 'constructor', so it is not a constructor. Additionally,
            the function sets the state variable `OppToken` to a new value based on the parameter `newToken`, which is not hardcoded. Therefore, the function does not
            have hardcoded state variables.

                      Reason: The modifier requires that msg.sender is equal to owner, which is a check to ensure that only the owner can execute the function, fulfilling
                      rule 1. There's no structure corresponding to rule 2 present, as there is no lock or unlock operation found in the code.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
