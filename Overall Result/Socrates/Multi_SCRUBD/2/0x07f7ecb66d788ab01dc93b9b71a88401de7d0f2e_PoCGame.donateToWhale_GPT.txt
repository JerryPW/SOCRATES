Function Security Analysis for PoCGame.donateToWhale(uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function donateToWhale.
    Check direct function security
        - function PoCGame.donateToWhale(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not include any of the required structures involving msg.sender and xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
        - function PoCGame.donateToWhale(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not contain any of the specified structures. It is a function that performs an Ethereum smart contract call to a 'whale' address and
          does not involve any kind of requirement checks or boolean variable manipulations as described in the scenarios.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['donate']
        Function Security Analysis for PoCGame.donate()
            The modifier of function donate are ['isOpenToPublic']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier isOpenToPublic has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier isOpenToPublic is checking a condition that seems unrelated to enforcing execution by only specific addresses (like owner or
                  admin), nor does it indicate a lock mechanism or have a name suggesting such a function, such as Onlyxxx or nonReentrant.
            Check direct function security
                - function PoCGame.donate() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function `donate()` does not include any require, if, or assert statements that involve `msg.sender`. It does not check the sender's address
                  against an owner or leader type address.
                - function PoCGame.donate() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code provided does not have any of the specified structures. It merely defines a function named `donate` without any `require` or `if`
                  statement controlling a variable with assignment as described in the conditions.

    Analyze Gas
        - whale.call.value(amount)(bytes4(keccak256()(donate()))) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['whale.call.value(amount)(bytes4(keccak256()(donate())))']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['whale'] should be checked in variable whale
        Checked variables: whale
            Yes The provided code is clearly a constructor because the function is explicitly named 'constructor'. Additionally, the state variable 'whale' is being set
            to 'whaleAddress', which is a parameter of the constructor, not hardcoded within the code.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
