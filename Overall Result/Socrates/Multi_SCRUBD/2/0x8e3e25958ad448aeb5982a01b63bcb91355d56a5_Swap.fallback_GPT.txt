Function Security Analysis for Swap.fallback()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
    Check direct function security
        - function Swap.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function mainly uses 'require' statements for conditions, none of which include checking if 'msg.sender' is equal to or not equal to any specific
          owner, address, leader, or CEO variable. There is no logic within this function that matches the specified patterns which would check 'msg.sender' against any
          such specifically named variable.
        - function Swap.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code satisfies structure 2: it has a 'require' that checks check[msg.sender] == false; followed by an assignment check[msg.sender] = true;. However,
          the state negation (check[msg.sender] = true;) is not performed immediately; it occurs after the main logic of the function, consisting of amount updates,
          conditional checks, transfers, and emissions.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['beneficiary.send(msg.value)', 'swapaddress.transfer(msg.sender,amount/secondvalue)', 'swapaddress.transfer(msg.sender,amount/third)',
    'swapaddress.transfer(msg.sender,amount/newvalue)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - beneficiary.send(msg.value) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call 'beneficiary.send(msg.value)'
        contains the keyword '.send('.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - swapaddress.transfer(msg.sender,amount/secondvalue) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - swapaddress.transfer(msg.sender,amount/third) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - swapaddress.transfer(msg.sender,amount/newvalue) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - swapaddress.transfer(msg.sender,amount/secondvalue) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - swapaddress.transfer(msg.sender,amount/third) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - swapaddress.transfer(msg.sender,amount/newvalue) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['swapaddress.transfer(msg.sender,amount/secondvalue)', 'swapaddress.transfer(msg.sender,amount/third)',
    'swapaddress.transfer(msg.sender,amount/newvalue)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['swapaddress'] should be checked in variable swapaddress
        Checked variables: swapaddress
            Yes The function in the provided code is a constructor because it shares the same name as the contract, which is 'Swap'. Additionally, constructors typically
            do not have a return type and this function does not specify one.
        There are ['swapaddress'] should be checked in variable swapaddress
        Checked variables: swapaddress
            Yes The provided code is a constructor since the function explicitly uses the keyword 'constructor' to define it. This satisfies the first characteristic, as
            constructors are typically identified by matching the function name with the contract name or by explicitly using 'constructor'.
        There are ['swapaddress'] should be checked in variable swapaddress
        Checked variables: swapaddress
            Yes The function shown is a constructor. It explicitly uses the keyword 'constructor' which matches characteristic 1 (checking for a constructor function).
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
