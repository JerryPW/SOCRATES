    Check direct function security
        - function PepFarmer.reapFarm() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code requires the presence of authorization checks based on specific roles such as xxxOwner or xxxAddress using structures like require or if
          conditions. This function checks if `workDone[msg.sender] > 0` but does not include any check specifically involving msg.sender and roles like
          xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
        - function PepFarmer.reapFarm() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code contains a line `require(workDone[msg.sender] > 0);` which is akin to `require(xxx == True);` when considering the logical implication of
          checking if a condition holds true. However, the next line `workDone[msg.sender] = 0;` does not follow the pattern of setting the variable to False (or True).
          Therefore, it does not fit the structure outlined.
