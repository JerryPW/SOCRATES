Function Security Analysis for BoomerangLiquidity.payout()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function payout.
    Check direct function security
        - function BoomerangLiquidity.payout() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures that check the identity of msg.sender against specific roles like Owner, Address,
          Leader, or CEO.
        - function BoomerangLiquidity.payout() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code contains a require statement with a condition `require(balance > 1);`, but it does not involve a boolean variable being set to True or False,
          thus it doesn't match the given structural patterns.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.send(payoutToSend)', 'flmContract.call.value(investment).gas(1000000)()',
    'participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.call.value(payoutToSend).gas(1000000)()']
    Analyze Transfer
        - participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.send(payoutToSend) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The
        external call contains the '.send(' keyword, satisfying one of the given characteristics.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - The gas limit in flmContract.call.value(investment).gas(1000000)() is 1000000, which is too high. Therefore, it will not prevent REE problem.
        - The gas limit in participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.call.value(payoutToSend).gas(1000000)() is 1000000, which is too high. Therefore, it will not prevent
        REE problem.
    Remaining external call: ['flmContract.call.value(investment).gas(1000000)()', 'participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.call.value(payoutToSend).gas(1000000)()']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['flmContract'] should be checked in variable flmContract
        Checked variables: flmContract
            Yes The provided code contains a function named 'BoomerangLiquidity', which matches the contract's name 'BoomerangLiquidity'. This suggests that the function
            is a constructor for the contract BoomerangLiquidity. Constructors don't require the 'constructor' keyword in older versions of Solidity, which simply matched
            the function name with the contract name.
        There are ['participants'] should be checked in variable participants
        Checked variables: participants
            No The provided code does not include a function that matches the contract name 'BoomerangLiquidity' or is explicitly named 'constructor', thus it is not a
            constructor. Also, there is no hardcoded state variable 'participants'. Therefore, neither of the characteristics are satisfied.
            Function Security Analysis for BoomerangLiquidity.deposit()
                There are no modifiers should be examined in function deposit.
                Check direct function security
                    - function BoomerangLiquidity.deposit() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                      Reason: The function does not contain any statements resembling 'require', 'if', or 'assert' that involve 'msg.sender ==
                      xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO' or variations thereof.
                    - function BoomerangLiquidity.deposit() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                      Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the structures specified in the problem. It simply adds a participant to a list with their address
                      and a calculated value based on the sent message value and a multiplier.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
