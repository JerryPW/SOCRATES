Function Security Analysis for IronHands.payout()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function payout.
    Check direct function security
        - function IronHands.payout() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures that check or assert if msg.sender is equal to or not equal to a specific Owner, Address,
          Leader, or CEO.
        - function IronHands.payout() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided function does not contain any of the specified structures. The closest element is 'require(balance > 1);', but it does not fit the pattern
          where the same variable is later set to True or False, as dictated by the conditions 1-4. Hence, it does not match any of the specified patterns.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.call.value(payoutToSend).gas(1000000)()', 'weak_hands.buy.value(investment).gas(1000000)(msg.sender)']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - The gas limit in participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.call.value(payoutToSend).gas(1000000)() is 1000000, which is too high. Therefore, it will not prevent
        REE problem.
        - The gas limit in weak_hands.buy.value(investment).gas(1000000)(msg.sender) is 1000000, which is too high. Therefore, it will not prevent REE problem.
    Remaining external call: ['participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.call.value(payoutToSend).gas(1000000)()',
    'weak_hands.buy.value(investment).gas(1000000)(msg.sender)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['participants'] should be checked in variable participants
        Checked variables: participants
            No The code provided consists of two functions: 'deposit()' and 'payout()'. Neither of these functions is a constructor because there is no function named
            'IronHands' (the contract name) or 'constructor'. Additionally, the state variable 'participants' is only manipulated dynamically through logic (like the push
            operation in 'deposit') and not set to any hardcoded value. Therefore, neither of the specified characteristics is satisfied.
            Function Security Analysis for IronHands.deposit()
                There are no modifiers should be examined in function deposit.
                Check direct function security
                    - function IronHands.deposit() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                      Reason: The function does not check or restrict the msg.sender against any specific owner, address, or role like xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or
                      CEO.
                    - function IronHands.deposit() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                      Reason: The code does not contain any of the mentioned structures involving require or if statements with variable manipulations as specified. The
                      require statement in the code checks msg.value conditions, which does not fall under the specified patterns.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
