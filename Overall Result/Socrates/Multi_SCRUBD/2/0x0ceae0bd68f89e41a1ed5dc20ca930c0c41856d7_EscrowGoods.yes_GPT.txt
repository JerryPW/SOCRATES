Function Security Analysis for EscrowGoods.yes(uint256,string,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function yes.
    Check direct function security
        - function EscrowGoods.yes(uint256,string,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code structure does not contain checks on the identity of msg.sender comparing it to any owner, address, leader, or CEO.
        - function EscrowGoods.yes(uint256,string,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures like `require(xxx == True)` followed by `xxx = False`, `require(xxx == False)` followed by
          `xxx = True`, `require(!xxx)` followed by `xxx = True`, or `if(!xxx) throw` followed by `xxx = true`. It mainly consists of conditional checks and returns but
          not with the specific required pattern.

Function Security Analysis for EscrowGoods.safeSend(address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function safeSend.
    Check direct function security
        - function EscrowGoods.safeSend(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified checks involving msg.sender.
        - function EscrowGoods.safeSend(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon re-evaluating the code, the correct structure should involve:  4. {if(!xxx) throw; xxx = true; ... xxx = False;}  However, the code actually
          contains: "if(atomicLock) throw; atomicLock = true;"  but the initial condition should be 'if(!atomicLock)' according to the structure in pattern 4. This
          doesn't fully satisfy the requirement because the negation is missing. The existing code checks if atomicLock is true (without negation), instead of false as
          specified in 'if(!xxx)'. This is a common mistake, leading to a misinterpretation previously.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['getMoney', 'reject', 'arbYes', 'getFees', 'yes']
        Function Security Analysis for EscrowGoods.getMoney(uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function getMoney.
            Check direct function security
                - function EscrowGoods.getMoney(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any condition that checks or asserts anything related to msg.sender. Therefore, it doesn't match any of the given
                  structures.
                - function EscrowGoods.getMoney(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The given code does not have any of the specified structures. There are checks and actions based on conditions, but they are not of the form
                  'require(xxx)' then changing xxx's value, nor do they use 'if(!xxx) throw' followed by changing xxx's value. Instead, the logic revolves around
                  conditionally sending payments and logging debug messages without redefining the same variable in the required pattern.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['addr.call.gas(safeGas).value(value)()']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - addr.call.gas(safeGas).value(value)() is subjected to gas limits safeGas <= 3000. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The variable
        in question is `safeGas`, which is assigned a constant value of 25000 in the code. This value does not change anywhere in the code, as it is a constant. Constants
        in Solidity, like `safeGas` here, are assigned with the `constant` keyword, indicating that this value is immutable and will not be updated or modified during the
        execution of the contract. Therefore, since `safeGas` is always 25000, it is always less than or equal to 3000.  Thus, the statement that `safeGas` is always less
        than or equal to 3000 is true, given that its value is fixed at 25000 from the start of the contract and never changes.
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
