    Analyze Gas
        - buccTransfer.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['buccTransfer.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),amount)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['v2Address'] should be checked in variable buccTransfer
        Checked variables: v2Address
            Yes The provided code contains a constructor function for the contract Sargasso that sets the state variable v2Address. The constructor matches one of the
            listed characteristics by being named 'constructor'. Moreover, in the second function, v2Address is updated dynamically based on the function input, not
            hardcoded.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
