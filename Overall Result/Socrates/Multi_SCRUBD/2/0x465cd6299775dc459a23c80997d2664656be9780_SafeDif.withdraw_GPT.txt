    Check direct function security
        - function SafeDif.withdraw() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code checks for conditions on the 'msg.sender', but it does not specifically verify if the 'msg.sender' matches any predefined owner, address,
          leader or CEO. Thus, none of the characteristics are met.
        - function SafeDif.withdraw() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the required patterns listed in the characteristics. While there is a require statement checking a condition, it does
          not follow the structure where a boolean variable has its value reversed as indicated (changing True to False or False to True after the require statement).
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['sender.send(amount)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - sender.send(amount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the '.send(' keyword,
        thus it satisfies the characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
