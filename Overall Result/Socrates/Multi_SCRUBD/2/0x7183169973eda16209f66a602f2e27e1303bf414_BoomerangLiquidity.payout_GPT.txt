Function Security Analysis for BoomerangLiquidity.payout()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function payout.
    Check direct function security
        - function BoomerangLiquidity.payout() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not have any checks for 'msg.sender' against any specific owner, leader, CEO, or address. It only checks the balance of the contract.
        - function BoomerangLiquidity.payout() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code uses require(balance > 1) but does not change the value of balance directly to a boolean value, nor satisfies any other specified pattern.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['weak_hands.buy.value(investment)(msg.sender)', 'participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.send(payoutToSend)',
    'participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.call.value(payoutToSend).gas(1000000)()']
    Analyze Transfer
        - participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.send(payoutToSend) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The
        external call contains '.send('.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - weak_hands.buy.value(investment)(msg.sender) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - The gas limit in participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.call.value(payoutToSend).gas(1000000)() is 1000000, which is too high. Therefore, it will not prevent
        REE problem.
    Remaining external call: ['weak_hands.buy.value(investment)(msg.sender)', 'participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.call.value(payoutToSend).gas(1000000)()']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['weak_hands'] should be checked in variable weak_hands
        Checked variables: weak_hands
            Yes The function name 'BoomerangLiquidity' matches the contract name, indicating that this function is a constructor for the contract 'BoomerangLiquidity'.
        There are ['participants'] should be checked in variable participants
        Checked variables: participants
            No 1. The functions provided in the contract code are 'deposit' and 'payout', which do not match the contract's name 'BoomerangLiquidity', nor are they
            explicitly named 'constructor'. Hence, they do not satisfy the constructor requirement.  2. The functions do not hardcode the state variable 'participants'.
            The 'participants' variable is used dynamically within these functions; it's not assigned a fixed value or index, meaning no hardcoded interaction is present.
            Function Security Analysis for BoomerangLiquidity.deposit()
                There are no modifiers should be examined in function deposit.
                Check direct function security
                    - function BoomerangLiquidity.deposit() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                      Reason: The code does not contain any check for 'msg.sender' against an owner, address, leader, or CEO. It only utilizes 'msg.sender' to create a
                      Participant object and doesn't have any require, if, or assert statement to assert specific conditions regarding 'msg.sender'.
                    - function BoomerangLiquidity.deposit() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                      Reason: The function does not contain any require statements or control flow involving setting a variable to True or False. It only contains logic
                      for pushing a value to a list and calling other functions.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
