          followed by 'xxx = True', etc. It has a 'require' statement, but it checks for a condition 'block.number > endBlock', which does not match the specified
          patterns involving boolean variable checks and assignments.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['f.announceWinner.value(rake/4)(lastPresser,address(this).balance)', 'owner.send(3*rake/4)',
    'f.announceWinner.value(rake)(lastPresser,address(this).balance)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - owner.send(3*rake/4) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call 'owner.send(3*rake/4)' contains the

    Remaining external call: ['f.announceWinner.value(rake/4)(lastPresser,address(this).balance)', 'f.announceWinner.value(rake)(lastPresser,address(this).balance)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['factory'] should be checked in variable f
        Checked variables: factory
            State variable factory has initialized in public area after declaration.
        There are ['factory'] should be checked in variable f
        Checked variables: factory
            State variable factory has initialized in public area after declaration.
