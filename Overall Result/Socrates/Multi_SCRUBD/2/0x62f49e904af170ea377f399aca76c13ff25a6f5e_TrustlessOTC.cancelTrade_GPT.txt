          Reason: In the provided code, the condition 'require(msg.sender == o.creator);' checks if the message sender is the creator of the trade offer, which is a local
          variable and does not explicitly refer to xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO. Therefore, it does not satisfy any of the listed structures using the specified
          conditions. Hence, the initial assessment is incorrect.
        - function TrustlessOTC.cancelTrade(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not contain any of the patterns specified in the structure list: it lacks a statement that checks a variable and subsequently alters
          it; instead, it checks a condition related to message sender and performs actions concerning a trade.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['Token(o.tokenFrom).transfer(o.creator,o.amountFrom)']

    Analyze Gas
        - Token(o.tokenFrom).transfer(o.creator,o.amountFrom) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['Token(o.tokenFrom).transfer(o.creator,o.amountFrom)']
    Analyze External Address
        The variable 'o' in external call 'Token(o.tokenFrom).transfer(o.creator,o.amountFrom)' has no state variable assigned in TrustlessOTC.cancelTrade(uint256).
        Therefore we check whether it has been hardcoded in the function.
            No The variable 'o' is assigned from a dynamic input 'offers[tradeID]' and is specific to the function's operation based on the input 'tradeID', thus it is
            not hardcoded.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
