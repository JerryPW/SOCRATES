Function Security Analysis for Crowdsale.updatePrice()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function updatePrice.
    Check direct function security
        - function Crowdsale.updatePrice() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any explicit checks or assertions that involve 'msg.sender == xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO' or similar checks ensuring the
          sender is a specific owner or role.
        - function Crowdsale.updatePrice() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not have any 'require' statements or throw conditions with specific variable assignments that match the predefined structures.

Start analyze function: usingOraclize.oraclize_query(uint256,string,string)
Function Security Analysis for usingOraclize.oraclize_query(uint256,string,string)
    The modifier of function oraclize_query are ['oraclizeAPI']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier oraclizeAPI has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The code provided in the modifier does not contain any explicit owner address checks or lock mechanisms. It mainly deals with setting up or checking
          some network or oracle-related addresses, thus not fulfilling any of the provided characteristics.
    Check direct function security
        - function usingOraclize.oraclize_query(uint256,string,string) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any access control structure checking or throwing exceptions based on the identity of msg.sender, such as require or if
          statements related to specific roles like xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
        - function usingOraclize.oraclize_query(uint256,string,string) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code doesn't match any of the specified structures. There are no 'require' or 'if' statements checking and changing the same variable's value as
          described in any of the patterns.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['__callback', '__callback', 'updatePrice']
        Function Security Analysis for usingOraclize.__callback(bytes32,string)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function __callback.
            Check direct function security
                - function usingOraclize.__callback(bytes32,string) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The provided code snippet does not include any direct check or assertion on msg.sender against a specific owner or address structure mentioned
                  in the criteria.
                - function usingOraclize.__callback(bytes32,string) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The given code does not satisfy any of the specified structures. There is no use of 'require' with a boolean check, nor any variable assignment
                  patterns as described in the required structures. The function is simply calling another version of itself with different parameters without any logical
                  checks or state changes related to a condition.

Start analyze function: usingOraclize.oraclize_getPrice(string)
Function Security Analysis for usingOraclize.oraclize_getPrice(string)
    The modifier of function oraclize_getPrice are ['oraclizeAPI']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier oraclizeAPI has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The code in the modifier does not enforce that only the owner or specific addresses can execute the function, nor does it implement a lock mechanism.
          Additionally, the modifier name `oraclizeAPI` does not suggest any restrictions such as ownership or reentrancy lock.
    Check direct function security
        - function usingOraclize.oraclize_getPrice(string) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function "oraclize_getPrice" does not contain any check for 'msg.sender' against an owner or specific address. It simply calls
          "oraclize.getPrice(datasource);", hence none of the listed structures are present.
        - function usingOraclize.oraclize_getPrice(string) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided function does not have any require clause or condition structures that match any of the specified patterns given. It simply returns the
          result of calling `oraclize.getPrice(datasource);`.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['__callback', '__callback', 'updatePrice']
        Function Security Analysis for usingOraclize.__callback(bytes32,string)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function __callback.
            Check direct function security
                - function usingOraclize.__callback(bytes32,string) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function __callback(bytes32 myid, string result) does not contain any of the specified structures such as require(), if(msg.sender != ...),
                  if (msg.sender != ...) throw;, or assert() that are checking the msg.sender against an owner or claimant type of variable.
                - function usingOraclize.__callback(bytes32,string) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code snippet provided does not contain any of the specified patterns. It only shows the implementation of a function '__callback', which
                  calls itself with different arguments. There is no 'require' statement or any conditional logic involving boolean variables present.
