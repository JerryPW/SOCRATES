    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _transfer.
    Check direct function security
        - function ShibaUncle._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code contains an 'if' statement that checks if 'msg.sender' is not equal to 'pair', which is not directly related to checking against an owner,
          leader, or CEO. However, there is another 'if' statement checking if 'sender' and 'recipient' are not equal to 'owner'. Hence, neither the 'msg.sender'
          condition nor the 'require' or 'assert' statements meet the described characteristics specifically referring to 'msg.sender' and a role of
          xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO in the provided code logic.
        - function ShibaUncle._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code contains checks using `require` statements, but none of them match the specified structures where a variable is required to be either True or
          False, and then the variable is assigned to the opposite value. Therefore, the code does not satisfy any of the given structures.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transferFrom', 'transfer']
        Function Security Analysis for ShibaUncle.transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transferFrom.
            Check direct function security
                - function ShibaUncle.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain any statements that check if msg.sender is equal or not equal to any owner or leader address such as
                  xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO. It simply updates allowances and transfers funds.
                - function ShibaUncle.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code does not contain a structure that matches any of the specified patterns. There is no 'require' statement or an 'if' condition
                  that meets the criteria outlined. The code primarily consists of an 'if' condition followed by operations on array elements without explicit assignments
                  to the tested condition variable.

    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - coolUncle.setShare(sender,_balances[sender]) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - coolUncle.setShare(recipient,_balances[recipient]) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['coolUncle.setShare(sender,_balances[sender])', 'coolUncle.setShare(recipient,_balances[recipient])']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['coolUncle'] should be checked in variable coolUncle
        Checked variables: coolUncle
            Yes The code is a constructor because the function explicitly named 'constructor'.
        There are ['coolUncle'] should be checked in variable coolUncle
        Checked variables: coolUncle
            Yes The provided code has a function named 'constructor', which matches the requirement for determining if it is a constructor. The function directly
            initializes the contract and sets initial state variables and configurations.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: ShibaUncle.swapBack()
Function Security Analysis for ShibaUncle.swapBack()
    The modifier of function swapBack are ['lockTheSwap']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier lockTheSwap is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: In the modifier code, there is both a lock operation (inSwapAndLiquify = true) before the function's main body and an unlock operation (inSwapAndLiquify
          = false) after the function's main body. This meets the requirement for characteristic 2.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
