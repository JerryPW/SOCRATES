Function Security Analysis for DCY_preICO.fallback()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
    Check direct function security
        - function DCY_preICO.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code snippet does not contain any of the specified structures related to verifying 'msg.sender' against an 'xxxOwner', 'xxxAddress', 'Leader', or
          'CEO'.
        - function DCY_preICO.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon re-evaluating the code, it starts with 'require(!crowdsaleClosed);' but does not immediately follow with 'crowdsaleClosed = true;'. Instead,
          'crowdsaleClosed = true;' is conditionally set only if 'tokensLeft == 0', which does not satisfy the strict requirement of the structure where 'xxx = True;'
          should unconditionally follow after the 'require(!xxx);' statement without any intermediate conditions, other code execution paths, or dependencies. Therefore,
          both required statements that match the structure are not contiguous in this code block, meaning the structure match was incorrect.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,amount/price)', 'tokenReward.getBalanceOf(address(this))']
    Analyze Transfer
        - tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,amount/price) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,amount/price) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - tokenReward.getBalanceOf(address(this)) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,amount/price)', 'tokenReward.getBalanceOf(address(this))']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['tokenReward'] should be checked in variable tokenReward
        Checked variables: tokenReward
            Yes The function name 'DCY_preICO' matches the contract name 'DCY_preICO', indicating it is likely a constructor. There is no evidence of tokenReward being
            hardcoded with a constant value, but since the first condition is satisfied, the answer is 'Yes'.
        There are ['tokenReward'] should be checked in variable tokenReward
        Checked variables: tokenReward
            Yes The function name 'DCY_preICO' matches the contract name 'DCY_preICO', indicating that this function is a constructor. Constructor detection satisfies the
            first characteristic in the list.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
