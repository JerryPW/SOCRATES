Function Security Analysis for Crowdsale.fallback()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
    Check direct function security
        - function Crowdsale.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function doesn't have any of the specified constructs that check msg.sender against an xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO directly or indirectly as
          outlined in any of the four conditions.
        - function Crowdsale.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon re-evaluating the code, the initial analysis was incorrect. The given code contains 'require(!crowdsaleClosed);' which matches the first part of
          structure 3, but it lacks the second required statement 'crowdsaleClosed = True;' or 'crowdsaleClosed = False;'. Thus, none of the given structures match fully.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['beneficiary.send(amount)', 'tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,sendTokens)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - beneficiary.send(amount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains '.send('
        keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,sendTokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,sendTokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,sendTokens)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['tokenReward'] should be checked in variable tokenReward
        Checked variables: tokenReward
            Yes The function 'Crowdsale' matches the name of the contract 'Crowdsale', indicating that it is a constructor. Constructors typically initialize the
            contract's state and are executed once during the deployment of the contract. Furthermore, within this constructor, the state variable 'tokenReward' is
            hardcoded with the address '0x745Fa4002332C020f6a05B3FE04BCCf060e36dD3'. Thus, the function satisfies both characteristics of being a constructor and having a
            hardcoded state variable.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
