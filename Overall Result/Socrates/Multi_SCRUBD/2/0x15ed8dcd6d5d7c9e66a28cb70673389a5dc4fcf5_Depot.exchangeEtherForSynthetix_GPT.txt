Function Security Analysis for Depot.exchangeEtherForSynthetix()
    The modifier of function exchangeEtherForSynthetix are ['pricesNotStale', 'notPaused']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier pricesNotStale has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier 'pricesNotStale' does not clearly indicate ownership control or a reentrancy lock based on its code or its name. It mainly checks for a
          condition if prices are stale, unrelated to ownership or reentrancy checks.
        - modifier notPaused has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier notPaused does not meet any of the specified criteria because it only checks a 'paused' state and not specific addresses or lock operations
          based on its code or name.
    Check direct function security
        - function Depot.exchangeEtherForSynthetix() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The provided code does not include any checks on `msg.sender` against an owner, address leader, or CEO pattern, nor does it use require, if, or assert
          statements with `msg.sender` as specified in the criteria.
        - function Depot.exchangeEtherForSynthetix() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures. It simply outlines the `exchangeEtherForSynthetix` function without using any
          `require` or `if` statements related to a boolean variable that meets specified conditions.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['synthetix.transfer(msg.sender,synthetixToSend)', 'fundsWallet.transfer(msg.value)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - fundsWallet.transfer(msg.value) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call contains the '.transfer('
        keyword, so it meets the criteria.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - synthetix.transfer(msg.sender,synthetixToSend) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['synthetix.transfer(msg.sender,synthetixToSend)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['synthetix'] should be checked in variable synthetix
        Checked variables: synthetix
            Yes The provided code contains a constructor for the contract named 'Depot'. The constructor is explicitly defined using the keyword 'constructor'. Although
            there are state variables being updated in the constructor, they are not hardcodedâ€”they are set using constructor arguments provided during deployment.  The
            state variable 'synthetix' is updated in the constructor but it's not hardcoded there; it's assigned via a parameter. Additionally, the external function
            'setSynthetix' updates the 'synthetix' state variable but it also doesn't hardcode a value.  Therefore, the constructor characteristic is satisfied.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Function Security Analysis for Depot.synthetixReceivedForEther(uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function synthetixReceivedForEther.
    Check direct function security
        - function Depot.synthetixReceivedForEther(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any require, if, or assert statements that check msg.sender against any designated Owner/Address/Leader/CEO.
        - function Depot.synthetixReceivedForEther(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not include any require statements or conditional checks, so it does not fit any of the specified structures.

    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: Depot.synthetixReceivedForSynths(uint256)
Function Security Analysis for Depot.synthetixReceivedForSynths(uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function synthetixReceivedForSynths.
    Check direct function security
        - function Depot.synthetixReceivedForSynths(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any 'require', 'if', or 'assert' statements related to msg.sender being compared to specific owner, address, or leadership
          roles. It solely performs calculations and returns values based on those calculations.
        - function Depot.synthetixReceivedForSynths(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the required structures that check the state of a boolean variable (using `require` or `if(!xxx) throw`) and
          subsequently change its state. It only includes logic related to calculating values and returning a result.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['feePool.amountReceivedFromTransfer(amount)']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - feePool.amountReceivedFromTransfer(amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['feePool.amountReceivedFromTransfer(amount)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['feePool'] should be checked in variable feePool
        Checked variables: feePool
            Yes The provided code contains a constructor for the contract since the function is named 'constructor', and it assigns the state variable 'feePool' to an
            incoming argument '_feePool', not a hardcoded value.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
