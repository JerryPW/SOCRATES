                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The code includes the statement 'require(_owner == _msgSender())', which ensures only the owner can execute the function. This matches the
                      criteria of enforcing owner-specific execution under rule 1. There are no indications of a lock mechanism being employed, thus rule 2 is not
                      applicable here.
        There are ['_yzyETHV2Pair'] should be checked in variable _yzyETHV2Pair
        Checked variables: _yzyETHV2Pair
            No The function `changeYzyETHPair` in the given code does not have a name matching the contract name `YZYVault`, nor is it explicitly named 'constructor'.
            Hence, it is not a constructor. This function takes an external parameter `yzyETHPair` to set the state variable `_yzyETHV2Pair`, meaning it is not hardcoded.
            The variable is set dynamically based on the function's input parameter `yzyETHPair`. Therefore, none of the specified characteristics are satisfied.

                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The modifier enforces that only the owner can execute the function by using 'require(_owner == _msgSender(), ...)', which matches rule 1.
        There are ['_yzyETHV2Pair'] should be checked in variable _yzyETHV2Pair
        Checked variables: _yzyETHV2Pair
            No 1. The function 'changeYzyETHPair' does not match the contract name 'YZYVault' and is not named 'constructor', so it is not a constructor. 2. The function
            uses '_yzyETHV2Pair', but it assigns this state variable based on the input parameter 'yzyETHPair', rather than hardcoding it, so it doesn't satisfy the
            hardcoded state variable characteristic.

                The modifier of function changeYzyETHPair are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The modifier uses 'require(_owner == _msgSender())', which enforces that only the owner can execute the function. This satisfies rule 1 as
                      it directly checks if the caller is the owner, and there are no structural omissions regarding this rule.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The code in the modifier contains the line `require(_owner == _msgSender(), ...)`, which enforces that only the owner can execute the
                      function, thus satisfying rule 1. No structural omissions were found for this rule, and rule 2 is not applicable as there is no lock operation.

    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _sendLotteryAmount.
    Check direct function security
        - function YZYVault._sendLotteryAmount() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The provided function does not contain any statements that check if `msg.sender` is equal/not equal to `xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO` or use
          require/assert with similar conditions.
        - function YZYVault._sendLotteryAmount() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code checks the value of _enabledLottery and returns false immediately if it is false. The variable _enabledLottery is never set to true within the
          function. Hence, there are no statements with the specified structures as given (require...) or (if...throw) followed by setting a variable to another value.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

                - function YZYVault.claimYzyReward() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures involving 'require' statements followed by variable assignments. Specifically,
                  there is no usage of a 'require(xxx == True)' or 'require(xxx == False)' pattern with subsequent changes to the 'xxx' variable.

                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The modifier enforces that only the owner can execute the function, as it uses the require statement to check if the sender of the message
                      is the owner. This directly matches the condition in rule 1: 'require(msg.sender == xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO)', confirming that the function
                      can only be called by the owner.

            contract name and is not explicitly named 'constructor'. 2. The function modifies the state variable `_yzy`, but it does so with a parameter `yzy` that is
            passed into the function, rather than hardcoding a specific value. Hardcoding implies directly setting the state variable to a specific constant value in the
            code, which isn't the case here.

        - function YZYVault._swapAndClaimTokens(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures where a boolean variable is required to be true or false, then is set to the opposite
          value with or without an optional third assignment back to the initial state.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

                  Reason: None of the specified conditions regarding msg.sender are present in the code.
                - function YZYVault.stake() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: Upon reviewing the code again, the pattern `require(!isContract(...))` is present, but the statement `isContract = True;` does not exist in the
                  function. Therefore, the complete structure required to match characteristic 3 is not fulfilled in the code. This means the previous judgment was
                  incorrect because both required statements for the pattern were not present in the code.

                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The modifier contains the statement require(_owner == _msgSender(), "Ownable: caller is not the owner");, which checks if the caller
                      (msg.sender) is the owner, satisfying characteristic 1.
        There are ['_yzy'] should be checked in variable _yzy

            No The function named 'changeYzyAddress' does not match the contract name 'YZYVault', and it is not explicitly named 'constructor', so it does not satisfy the
            first characteristic. The function changes the state variable '_yzy' using a parameter 'yzy' provided externally instead of a hardcoded value. Hence, it does
            not satisfy the second characteristic either.

                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The code snippet clearly includes the statement require(_owner == _msgSender(), "Ownable: caller is not the owner"), which verifies if the
                      caller is the owner. This matches the first condition in its entirety, as there is an explicit check for ownership. The check is the only necessary
                      requirement for the provided condition, and there is no need for additional statements or parts for this specific rule. There are no structural
                      omissions, since the logic for ownership verification is adequately implemented with the require statement alone. The snippet does not involve lock
                      operations, thus rule 2 is not applicable here.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

                'constructor'. 2. The function is modifying the state variable `_yzy`, but it does not hardcode a value for `_yzy` since the new value of `_yzy` is
                determined by the external input parameter `yzy`. Therefore, it doesn't meet this characteristic either.
            Function Security Analysis for YZYVault.changeYzyAddress(address)
                The modifier of function changeYzyAddress are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The code `require(_owner == _msgSender(), "Ownable: caller is not the owner");` enforces that the caller must be the owner, satisfying the
                      first characteristic. There are no indications of a lock operation related to characteristic 2.
            There are ['_weth'] should be checked in variable _weth
            Checked variables: _weth
                Yes The provided code is for the constructor of the contract, as indicated by the function name 'constructor' matching characteristic 1. The presence of
                the '_weth' state variable in the constructor, which is initialized through an argument, does not involve hardcoding, but since the code is a constructor,
                this meets the requirement of characteristic 1.
            There are ['_weth'] should be checked in variable _weth
            Checked variables: _weth
                Yes 1. The provided code is a constructor as it is named 'constructor' and matches the typical constructor pattern in Solidity for initializing a
                contract. 2. The state variable '_weth' is passed as a parameter to the constructor and is not hardcoded within the constructor. Therefore, the second
                characteristic is not satisfied. Since the first characteristic is satisfied, the output is 'Yes'.
        There are ['_uniswapV2Router'] should be checked in variable _uniswapV2Router
        Checked variables: _uniswapV2Router
            Yes 1. The provided code is a constructor because the function is explicitly named 'constructor', meeting the first characteristic for determination. 2. The
            code hardcodes the '_uniswapV2Router' state variable with a specific address '0x7a250d5630B4cF539739dF2C5dAcb4c659F2488D', therefore satisfying the second
            characteristic requirement as well.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
