        There are ['swaps'] should be checked in variable swap
        Checked variables: swaps
            No None of the code snippets provided is a constructor as there is no function that matches the name of the contract 'EthTokenToSmthSwaps', nor is there an
            explicit 'constructor' keyword used. Additionally, none of the functions have hardcoded the state variable 'swaps'; instead, the functions manipulate 'swaps'
            through parameters passed to them at runtime.
            Function Security Analysis for EthTokenToSmthSwaps.createSwap(bytes20,address,uint256,address)

                Check direct function security
                    - function EthTokenToSmthSwaps.createSwap(bytes20,address,uint256,address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                      Reason: The code does not include any checks or assertions that specifically compare msg.sender to an admin or owner address with conditions like
                      require, if, or assert statements.
                    - function EthTokenToSmthSwaps.createSwap(bytes20,address,uint256,address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                      Reason: The function does not demonstrate any of the specified structures involving require statements combined with variable assignments and
                      conditions. It only contains require statements to check conditions but lacks subsequent modifications on the related condition variables as
                      specified.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
