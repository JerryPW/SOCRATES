Function Security Analysis for TopInvest125.pay()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function pay.
    Check direct function security
        - function TopInvest125.pay() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any statements that check or assert the identity of the caller (msg.sender) against an owner or leader, nor does it throw
          based on such a check. Therefore, it does not fit any of the listed structures.
        - function TopInvest125.pay() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures, such as require(xxx == True), require(xxx == False), require(!xxx), or if(!xxx)
          throw, along with subsequent assignments to the same variable xxx. Therefore, it does not match any of the defined patterns.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['fallback']
        Function Security Analysis for TopInvest125.fallback()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
            Check direct function security
                - function TopInvest125.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The provided code does not contain any direct conditions that involve checking if 'msg.sender' is equal to or not equal to any 'Owner',
                  'Address', 'Leader', or 'CEO'. The conditions are based on 'msg.value' or 'gasleft()', thus it doesn't satisfy any of the listed structures.
                - function TopInvest125.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided function does not contain any of the specific structures mentioned in the checklist. It includes 'require' statements, but none
                  that match the specific patterns where a variable is checked and then that same variable is reassigned a boolean value. The reassignments involve other
                  actions or checks, not involving a change between boolean True and False or vice versa in context of the same variable.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['dep.depositor.send(dep.expect)', 'dep.depositor.send(money)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - dep.depositor.send(dep.expect) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call contains the '.send('
        keyword, indicating it satisfies the second characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - dep.depositor.send(money) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call contains the '.send(' keyword,
        indicating it satisfies the second characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
