Function Security Analysis for LiquidityPool.addLiquidity(uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function addLiquidity.
    Check direct function security
        - function LiquidityPool.addLiquidity(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function 'addLiquidity' does not contain any checks or assertions involving msg.sender against a specific owner or address pattern as described in
          the criteria. It handles token transfers and computing penalties based on liquidity but does not check the sender for a specific role or position like Owner,
          Address, Leader, or CEO.
        - function LiquidityPool.addLiquidity(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided function does not have any 'require' or 'if' statements related to specific variable conditions like 'xxx == True' or 'xxx == False'.
          Additionally, there's no usage of boolean assignments or a conditional throw that match any of the specified patterns.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['pampToken.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),_numTokensToInvest)',

    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - pampToken.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),_numTokensToInvest) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - uniswapV2.addLiquidityETH{value:msg.value}(address(pampToken),_numTokensToInvest,0,0,address(this),now+86400) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['pampToken.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),_numTokensToInvest)',
    'uniswapV2.addLiquidityETH{value:msg.value}(address(pampToken),_numTokensToInvest,0,0,address(this),now+86400)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['pampToken'] should be checked in variable pampToken
        Checked variables: pampToken
            Yes The code includes a constructor function as indicated by the function named 'constructor'. This function initializes several state variables including the
            'pampToken', which has a hardcoded address in the constructor. As the function both matches the identifier for a constructor and has hardcoded the 'pampToken'
            state variable, it satisfies both conditions for the rule. Therefore, the rules are satisfied.
        There are ['uniswapV2'] should be checked in variable uniswapV2
        Checked variables: uniswapV2
            Yes The code provided contains a function with the name 'constructor', indicating that this function is indeed a constructor for the 'LiquidityPool' contract.
            Since constructors are used for initializing contracts and are not explicitly marked external calls, they satisfy the first characteristic. Furthermore, the
            constructor also initializes the state variable 'uniswapV2' with a hardcoded address, thus satisfying the second characteristic as well. Therefore, at least
            one characteristic is satisfied.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
