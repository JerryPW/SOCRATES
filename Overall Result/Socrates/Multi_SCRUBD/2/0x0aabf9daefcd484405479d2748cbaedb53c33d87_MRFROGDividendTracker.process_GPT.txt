Start analyze function: MRFROGDividendTracker.processAccount(address,bool)
Function Security Analysis for MRFROGDividendTracker.processAccount(address,bool)
    The modifier of function processAccount are ['onlyOwner']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: Rechecking the code, the 'onlyOwner' modifier contains the statement 'require(owner() == _msgSender(), "Ownable: caller is not the owner")'. This
          enforces that only the designated owner can execute the function. This matches the first characteristic required for outputting 'Yes' because it ensures only a
          specific address, the owner, can execute the function. There are no structural omissions in the initial judgment, as the presence of the require statement fully
          qualifies under point 1.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
