    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _swapAndLiquify.
    Check direct function security
        - function RedKnightToken._swapAndLiquify() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The given function does not contain any of the specified conditions related to msg.sender, such as requiring or asserting that msg.sender is a specific
          owner or address.
        - function RedKnightToken._swapAndLiquify() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not contain 'require' or 'throw' statements, nor does it involve setting a boolean variable as specified by any of the structures in
          the checks.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

            Check direct function security
                - function RedKnightToken._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not involve any checks related to the sender's identity (msg.sender) against specific roles or addresses such as Owner,
                  Leader, or CEO. It focuses on various checks related to addresses and trading status but not specifically tied to msg.sender in the context of those
                  roles.
                - function RedKnightToken._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code structure doesn't match any of the required patterns. 'require(xxx == False)' and 'xxx = True' or other similar structures are not
                  present.
            Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

                    Check direct function security
                        - function RedKnightToken.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                          Reason: The provided function does not contain any of the listed structures involving 'msg.sender'. The function only handles transferring
                          tokens and updating allowances without checking 'msg.sender' against any specific owner or leader variables.
                        - function RedKnightToken.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                          Reason: The provided code does not contain a 'require' statement or an 'if' statement that directly involves toggling a boolean variable as per
                          the specified structures.

    'address(buyBackWallet).transfer(amountETHBuyBack)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - address(marketingWallet).transfer(amountETHMarketing) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external
        call contains the '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - address(devWallet).transfer(amountETHDev) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains
        the '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - address(buyBackWallet).transfer(amountETHBuyBack) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        contains the '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.

        - function RedKnightToken._swapTokensForETH(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures involving msg.sender checks against an owner or privileged account.
        - function RedKnightToken._swapTokensForETH(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures like 'require(xxx == True); xxx = False;', 'require(xxx == False); xxx = True;',

            Check direct function security
                - function RedKnightToken._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not have any condition checking `msg.sender` with specific ownership or specific address roles, such as xxxOwner, xxxAddress,
                  Leader, or CEO.
                - function RedKnightToken._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specific structures defined in the problem statement. Although it uses multiple 'require'
                  statements and boolean checks, none match the outlined structures, such as setting a boolean variable to true or false following a specific conditional
                  check that uses 'require' or '!'.

                          Reason: The code does not contain any checks or assertions involving msg.sender and owner or similar roles (xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO).
                          Thus, it does not meet any of the specified structures.
                        - function RedKnightToken.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                          Reason: The given code doesn't include any of the specified patterns, such as requirement or conditional structures with boolean operations
                          followed by reassignments of the same variable as outlined in the characteristics. Therefore, it does not match any of the patterns provided for
                          outputting 'Yes'.

    Check direct function security
        - function RedKnightToken._addLiquidity(uint256,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function _addLiquidity does not contain any conditional checks involving msg.sender related to xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO.
        - function RedKnightToken._addLiquidity(uint256,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code provided does not contain any require statements checking for a boolean condition being True or False, nor does it have a structure with an
          immediate throw if a boolean is false. Thus, it does not match any of the specified structures.

            Check direct function security
                - function RedKnightToken._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not include any of the specified structures. It primarily checks conditions for trading permissions and transaction specifics,
                  but not owner-specific validations using msg.sender.
                - function RedKnightToken._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures. It mostly consists of `require` statements to enforce conditions, but they do not
                  alter variables as specified in the patterns (1, 2, 3, or 4).

                          Reason: The function 'transferFrom' does not contain any conditions checking that msg.sender is equal to an owner or leader address, nor does it
                          contain any conditions checking that msg.sender is not equal to an owner or leader address. It only involves transferring tokens and approving
                          allowance checks.
                        - function RedKnightToken.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the required structures mentioned in the instructions. There is no use of 'require' or 'if'

            variable 'uniswapV2Router' is explicitly assigned a hardcoded address value from the IRouter. This satisfies both characteristics, checking the constructor
            name and verifying the hardcoded state variable.
