    Check direct function security
        - function DividendPayingToken._withdrawDividendOfUser(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: None of the specified patterns related to checking msg.sender's identity are found in this code.
        - function DividendPayingToken._withdrawDividendOfUser(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not contain any of the specific structures mentioned in the provided criteria. Those conditions involve specific require or if
          statements followed by assignments to a boolean variable, which are not present in this code.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

            Check direct function security
                - function DividendPayingToken.withdrawDividend() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the required structures for the specified checks. There are no conditional statements that check
                  msg.sender against a specific owner or leader address.

    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - user.call{gas:gasForTransfer,value:_withdrawableDividend}() is subjected to gas limits gasForTransfer <= 3000. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here
        is the reason: The code provided is a Solidity snippet that defines a constructor for a contract extending the ERC20 standard. In the constructor of the contract,
        the variable `gasForTransfer` is explicitly initialized with the value of `3000`. Since this assignment occurs within the constructor and establishes `3000` as
        the initial and only value assigned to `gasForTransfer` in the provided code, it is correct to say that the value of `gasForTransfer` will be less than or equal
        to `3000`.  No operations or further assignments affecting `gasForTransfer` are provided, which confirms that its value remains `3000`. Therefore, every
        assignment to `gasForTransfer` present in the provided code ensures that it does not exceed `3000`. Hence, the condition of being always less than or equal to
        `3000` is satisfied.
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
