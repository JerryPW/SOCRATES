Function Security Analysis for Crowdsale.buyTokens(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function buyTokens.
    Check direct function security
        - function Crowdsale.buyTokens(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function 'buyTokens' does not include any of the specified structures that check if the caller (msg.sender) matches a specific owner, address, or
          role such as Owner, Leader, or CEO.
        - function Crowdsale.buyTokens(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any statements matching the given structures. There are no 'require', 'if(!xxx) throw', or assignments setting a boolean
          variable to true and subsequently to false or vice versa.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['msg.sender.transfer(_diff)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - msg.sender.transfer(_diff) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the
        '.transfer(' keyword, specifically 'msg.sender.transfer(_diff)'. According to the provided rules, this satisfies the characteristic 1.. Parameter in
        'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: Crowdsale._processPurchase(address,uint256)
Function Security Analysis for Crowdsale._processPurchase(address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _processPurchase.
    Check direct function security
        - function Crowdsale._processPurchase(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any require, if, or assert statements related to msg.sender and its comparison with an owner or authority address.
        - function Crowdsale._processPurchase(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures as it lacks any 'require' statement or 'throw' pattern with a variable change between True and
          False as described.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['buyTokens', 'manualSale', 'fallback']

            There are no modifiers should be examined in function buyTokens.
            Check direct function security
                - function Crowdsale.buyTokens(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain require, if or assert statements related to checking if msg.sender is equal to any owner or leader address as
                  described in the criteria.
                - function Crowdsale.buyTokens(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures involving 'require' or 'if' statements related to the variable assignment of a
                  boolean. The conditions provided do not match any of the patterns given in the defined characteristics.

Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: Crowdsale._deliverTokens(address,uint256)
Function Security Analysis for Crowdsale._deliverTokens(address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _deliverTokens.
    Check direct function security
        - function Crowdsale._deliverTokens(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function '_deliverTokens' does not check 'msg.sender' against any specific address or owner role using 'require', 'if', or 'assert'. It directly
          calls 'safeOwnerTransfer'.
        - function Crowdsale._deliverTokens(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function _deliverTokens does not contain any of the specified structures involving 'require' or conditional statements with specific variable
          assignments.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['buyTokens', 'manualSale', 'fallback', '_processPurchase']
        Function Security Analysis for Crowdsale.buyTokens(address)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function buyTokens.
            Check direct function security
                - function Crowdsale.buyTokens(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain any checks/restrictions on the msg.sender being an owner, leader, or similar role.
                - function Crowdsale.buyTokens(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain the required structures with the `require` statements or `if(!xxx) throw`. There are also no assignments changing
                  boolean values like in the specified structures.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['token.safeOwnerTransfer(_beneficiary,_tokenAmount)']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - token.safeOwnerTransfer(_beneficiary,_tokenAmount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['token.safeOwnerTransfer(_beneficiary,_tokenAmount)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            Yes The provided code is a constructor as indicated by the function named 'constructor'. This matches the first characteristic outlined: "check whether the
            provided code is a constructor".
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
