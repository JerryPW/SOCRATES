Function Security Analysis for XYZProtocol._beforeTokenTransfer(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _beforeTokenTransfer.
    Check direct function security
        - function XYZProtocol._beforeTokenTransfer(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not have any of the specified structures that involve msg.sender and a role check like Owner, Address, Leader, or CEO.
        - function XYZProtocol._beforeTokenTransfer(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function contains a check `if (!isInPresale)` which is one part of the structure `if(!xxx) throw;`. However, there's no corresponding `xxx = true;`
          assignment for `isInPresale` within the function, so it does not fully match any of the defined structures.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['_transfer', 'transferFrom', 'transfer']
        Function Security Analysis for XYZProtocol._transfer(address,address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function _transfer.
            Check direct function security
                - function XYZProtocol._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The provided code does not contain any conditions or assertions where the 'msg.sender' is compared to an 'Owner', 'Address', 'Leader', or 'CEO'.
                  The logic primarily centers around verifying addresses and amounts, as well as exemptions and transaction limit checks, without any checks directly
                  relating to the caller's identity as a specific privileged address.
                - function XYZProtocol._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The function does not have any statement that matches a require or if statement followed by a variable assignment in the specified structure.
            Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
            The reachable functions are ['transferFrom', 'transfer']
                Function Security Analysis for XYZProtocol.transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
                    There are no modifiers should be examined in function transferFrom.
                    Check direct function security
                        - function XYZProtocol.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                          Reason: The code provided does not match any of the four specified structures that involve a permission check based on `msg.sender` being
                          compared to an owner or leader address.
                        - function XYZProtocol.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                          Reason: The code does not have any structure that checks a conditional requirement, such as `require(xxx == True)`, `require(xxx == False)`,
                          `require(!xxx)`, or `if(!xxx) throw` statements. It directly calls the `_transfer` and `_approve` functions without checking any condition on a
                          boolean variable.

Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: XYZProtocol.swapBack()
Function Security Analysis for XYZProtocol.swapBack()
    The modifier of function swapBack are ['nonReentrant']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier nonReentrant is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The code uses a lock operation that sets '_status = _ENTERED;' before the function runs and resets '_status = _NOT_ENTERED;' afterward, thus ensuring
          the function can only enter once, matching rule 2.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
