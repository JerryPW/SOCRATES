Function Security Analysis for Crowdsale.fallback()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
    Check direct function security
        - function Crowdsale.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not check the sender against any owner or specific address.
        - function Crowdsale.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon re-evaluation, the initial judgment was incorrect. To meet the structure criteria, both conditional checks and assignments should be present as
          specified in the conditions. In the provided function, the only relevant check is 'if (crowdsaleClosed', but there is no assignment to the 'crowdsaleClosed'
          variable following the throw. Similarly, other candidate variable checks like 'minimumTargetReached' are part of standard conditional logic without assignments
          that complete any of the required patterns. Thus, the code does not consistently use both necessary parts of any pattern listed.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,amount/price)', 'beneficiary.send(amount)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,amount/price) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - beneficiary.send(amount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        'beneficiary.send(amount)' contains the '.send(' keyword, therefore satisfies the second characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,amount/price) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,amount/price)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['tokenReward'] should be checked in variable tokenReward
        Checked variables: tokenReward
            State variable tokenReward has initialized in public area after declaration.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
