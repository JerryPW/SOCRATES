Function Security Analysis for Receiver.forward(address,bytes,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function forward.
    Check direct function security
        - function Receiver.forward(address,bytes,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code contains the statement 'require(msg.sender == implementation, ...);', but 'implementation' is not a specific role like xxxOwner, xxxAddress,
          Leader, or CEO as per the given instructions. It doesn't match the required pattern strictly as outlined in the task, which asks for specific roles like
          'xxxOwner', 'xxxAddress', 'Leader', or 'CEO'. Hence, it does not satisfy any of the given structures with the use of 'msg.sender'.
        - function Receiver.forward(address,bytes,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code checks for a condition using require but doesn't change the state of a variable related to the condition after require.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['_to.call.value(_value+msg.value)(_data)']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - _to.call.value(_value+msg.value)(_data) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['_to.call.value(_value+msg.value)(_data)']
    Analyze External Address
        The variable '_to' in external call '_to.call.value(_value+msg.value)(_data)' has no state variable assigned in Receiver.forward(address,bytes,uint256). Therefore
        we check whether it has been hardcoded in the function.
            No The variable `_to` is used as a parameter to the `call` function, which allows interactions with an address dynamically provided when the function is
            called. There is no explicit value assigned to `_to` within the function code, meaning that its value is not fixed or hardcoded within the function. Instead,
            `_to` will take whatever value is passed when the function `forward` is invoked.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
