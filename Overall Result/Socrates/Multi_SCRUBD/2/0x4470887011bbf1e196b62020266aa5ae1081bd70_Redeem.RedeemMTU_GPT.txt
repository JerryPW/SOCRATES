Function Security Analysis for Redeem.RedeemMTU(bool)
    The modifier of function RedeemMTU are ['paused']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier paused has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The code only contains a single line `require(!Paused);`, which checks if Paused is false before allowing the function to execute. There is no explicit
          lock (set Paused to true) or unlock (set Paused to false) in the modifier, so it does not fully satisfy Rule 2 as the corresponding unlock operation is missing.
    Check direct function security
        - function Redeem.RedeemMTU(bool) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures involving `msg.sender` comparisons that check against an owner or specific address.
        - function Redeem.RedeemMTU(bool) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function does not satisfy any of the specified structures as it doesn't contain any require statements that check if a boolean variable, which is
          the same across two assignments, is either True or False. Additionally, there are no paired assignments where the boolean is first set to True/False and later
          negated.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['tokenFunction.transfer(msg.sender,AppliedUnits)', 'msg.sender.transfer(withdrawVal)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - tokenFunction.transfer(msg.sender,AppliedUnits) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - msg.sender.transfer(withdrawVal) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains
        '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - tokenFunction.transfer(msg.sender,AppliedUnits) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['tokenFunction.transfer(msg.sender,AppliedUnits)']
    Analyze External Address
        The variable 'tokenFunction' in external call 'tokenFunction.transfer(msg.sender,AppliedUnits)' has no state variable assigned in Redeem.RedeemMTU(bool).
        Therefore we check whether it has been hardcoded in the function.
            No The provided variable, 'tokenFunction', is defined in the function as 'token tokenFunction = token(tokenAddress);'. The 'tokenAddress' is retrieved by
            calling 'getAddress("unit")', which implies that the address is dynamically fetched at runtime, rather than being hardcoded within the function. Therefore,
            since the 'tokenFunction' is assigned using this dynamically fetched address, it is not hardcoded.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
