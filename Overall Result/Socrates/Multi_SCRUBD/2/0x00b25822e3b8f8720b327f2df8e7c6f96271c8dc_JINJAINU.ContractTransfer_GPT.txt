    Check direct function security
        - function JINJAINU.ContractTransfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function ContractTransfer does not contain any of the specified structures relating to msg.sender. There's no check or requirement involving
          msg.sender being an owner, address, leader, or CEO comparable entity.
        - function JINJAINU.ContractTransfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures. It checks multiple conditions with `require` but none of them follow the required pattern
          exactly.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transferFrom', 'transfer', 'withdrawStuckTokens']
        Function Security Analysis for JINJAINU.transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transferFrom.
            Check direct function security
                - function JINJAINU.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain any statements that match the structured characteristics, such as require or assert statements checking if msg.sender
                  equals a specific owner or address.
                - function JINJAINU.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code snippet does not contain any 'require' statement, and none of the specified structures in the criteria are present in the code. The
                  function directly calls methods like 'ContractTransfer' and 'ContractApprove' without any of the identified conditional structures.

Start analyze function: JINJAINU.taxTokenSwap()
Function Security Analysis for JINJAINU.taxTokenSwap()
    The modifier of function taxTokenSwap are ['lockTheSwap']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier lockTheSwap is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: Upon re-evaluation, the function satisfies rule 2. The code uses a lock operation by setting 'isal' to true before executing the main body of the
          function and resetting it to false afterward. Both the lock (isal = true) and unlock (isal = false) operations are present, confirming a correct structural
          match according to rule 2.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
