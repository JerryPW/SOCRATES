    Analyze External Address
        There are ['tokenContract'] should be checked in variable tokenContract
        Checked variables: tokenContract
            Yes The provided code is a constructor. The code explicitly defines a function with the name 'constructor', which is one of the indicators of a constructor
            function in Solidity. Therefore, it satisfies the first characteristic.
        There are ['tokenContract'] should be checked in variable tokenContract
        Checked variables: tokenContract
            Yes The function provided in the code snippet is named 'constructor', which explicitly indicates that it is a constructor function. Constructor functions are
            responsible for initializing the contract and setting initial values for state variables. Since the function is a constructor, it satisfies the first
            characteristic.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
