Start analyze function: PunkMonkeyDividendTracker.processAccount(address,bool)
Function Security Analysis for PunkMonkeyDividendTracker.processAccount(address,bool)
    The modifier of function processAccount are ['onlyOwner']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The code uses a 'require' statement to enforce that only the owner can execute the function. Specifically, it checks if '_owner' is equal to
          '_msgSender()' with the message "Ownable: caller is not the owner". This matches rule 1 as it checks for owner authorization. There is no mention or
          implementation of a lock operation or flag, so rule 2 is not applicable.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
