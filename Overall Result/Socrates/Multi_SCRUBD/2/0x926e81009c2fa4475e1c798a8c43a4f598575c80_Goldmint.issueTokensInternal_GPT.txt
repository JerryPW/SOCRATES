    There are no modifiers should be examined in function issueTokensInternal.
    Check direct function security
        - function Goldmint.issueTokensInternal(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any verification or assertion based on the msg.sender being a specific owner, address, leader, or CEO.
        - function Goldmint.issueTokensInternal(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code provided does not match any of the specified structures. It includes a require statement but does not verify a boolean variable assigned with
          true or false, nor does it include subsequent reassignments to the same variable.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['buyTokens', 'issueTokensFromOtherCurrency', 'fallback']
        Function Security Analysis for Goldmint.buyTokens(address)
            The modifier of function buyTokens are ['onlyInState']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyInState has no relation with controlled by owner.

                  mechanism or has a suggestive name related to ownership or non-reentrancy.
            Check direct function security
                - function Goldmint.buyTokens(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not have any of the specified characteristics like require(msg.sender == xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO), if (msg.sender !=
                  xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO), etc.
                - function Goldmint.buyTokens(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code provided does not contain any of the specified structures (1, 2, 3, or 4). There is no requirement or if statement manipulating a
                  variable as described, such as requiring a boolean to be true or false, then changing it, with or without additional optional steps.
