    Check direct function security
        - function cb_BANK.Collect(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The given code does not specifically check if the msg.sender is an Owner/Address/Leader/CEO role directly in the conditions listed (using require, if,
          or assert for role verification as specified). It only checks against balance and unlockTime conditions.
        - function cb_BANK.Collect(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not contain any 'require' or 'if' condition that throws an exception specifically on the same variable being true or false. It
          simply has an 'if' condition but no exception is thrown with the 'throw' keyword, and there is no variable toggled between true and false as specified in the
          patterns.
