Function Security Analysis for IronHands.payout()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function payout.
    Check direct function security
        - function IronHands.payout() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any statement that involves a role or address-based restriction or validation specifically on 'msg.sender'. Thus, it does not
          meet any of the provided structural characteristics.
        - function IronHands.payout() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given function does not contain any of the specified structures such as setting a boolean variable requiring its value to be true/false and then
          changing its value. The function primarily deals with numeric manipulation and control flow without the use of boolean variables as per the specified patterns.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.call.value(payoutToSend).gas(1000000)()', 'weak_hands.buy.value(investment).gas(1000000)(msg.sender)']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - The gas limit in participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.call.value(payoutToSend).gas(1000000)() is 1000000, which is too high. Therefore, it will not prevent
        REE problem.
        - The gas limit in weak_hands.buy.value(investment).gas(1000000)(msg.sender) is 1000000, which is too high. Therefore, it will not prevent REE problem.
    Remaining external call: ['participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.call.value(payoutToSend).gas(1000000)()',
    'weak_hands.buy.value(investment).gas(1000000)(msg.sender)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['participants'] should be checked in variable participants
        Checked variables: participants
            No 1. The provided function names do not match the contract name 'IronHands', nor is there a function named 'constructor'. Therefore, there is no constructor.
            2. The state variable 'participants' is utilized in the code, specifically within the 'deposit' and 'payout' functions, but there is no hardcoded value set
            directly in those functions for 'participants'. Thus, no state variable is hardcoded in the functions provided.
            Function Security Analysis for IronHands.deposit()
                The modifier of function deposit are ['limitBuy']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier limitBuy has no relation with controlled by owner.
                      Reason: The provided `limitBuy` modifier checks if the transaction value exceeds a predefined limit but does not enforce any condition on the
                      ownership or specific addresses executing the function, nor does it implement a lock mechanism. Therefore, it does not fit any of the mentioned
                      characteristics.
                Check direct function security
                    - function IronHands.deposit() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                      Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specific structures checking or asserting the identity of 'msg.sender' against an owner or
                      specific address role such as xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
                    - function IronHands.deposit() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                      Reason: The code provided does not contain any of the required structures listed in the prompt. There is a 'require' statement, but it does not
                      include a variable being set to true or false after the 'require' call. Furthermore, the structure involving 'if(!xxx) throw;' is not present
                      either. Therefore, the function does not meet any of the characteristics specified.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
