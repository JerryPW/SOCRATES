          Reason: Upon reviewing the code, there are several instances of 'if' statements that check a condition and throw if it is not met, specifically checking for
          zero values to throw errors. However, these do not match the exact structure 4 ('if(!xxx) throw; xxx = true;') as there is no subsequent assignment 'xxx =
          true;' immediately following these conditions to satisfy the required sequence in the specified pattern. There are conditional structures that throw exceptions,
          but they do not exactly meet the requirements listed such that both parts of the pattern (including assignment of a boolean to 'true') are present together.
