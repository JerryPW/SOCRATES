Function Security Analysis for DividendDistributor.distributeDividend(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function distributeDividend.
    Check direct function security
        - function DividendDistributor.distributeDividend(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: No check for msg.sender against any owner, address, leader, or CEO equivalent is present.
        - function DividendDistributor.distributeDividend(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the required structures mentioned. There is no 'require' or 'if(!xxx) throw' statements with a subsequent
          variable assignment in the specified form.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['setShare', 'process', 'claimDividend']
        Function Security Analysis for DividendDistributor.setShare(address,uint256)
            The modifier of function setShare are ['onlyToken']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyToken is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The modifier 'onlyToken' enforces that only the address stored in '_token' can execute the function. This is evident by the line
                  'require(msg.sender == _token);', which matches the structure of 'require(msg.sender == xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO);'. No evidence of lock operation
                  related to the structure 2 is found in the code.
        Function Security Analysis for DividendDistributor.process(uint256)
            The modifier of function process are ['onlyToken']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyToken is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The modifier contains the statement `require(msg.sender == _token);`, which verifies that only a specific address (_token) can execute the
                  function. This satisfies the first characteristic of enforcing access control by specific addresses or owner.
        Function Security Analysis for DividendDistributor.claimDividend(address)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function claimDividend.
            Check direct function security
                - function DividendDistributor.claimDividend(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function 'claimDividend' does not contain any of the structures specified for checking 'msg.sender'. It only checks a condition with
                  'shouldDistribute' and does not involve comparing 'msg.sender' with any owner or leader address.
                - function DividendDistributor.claimDividend(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code provided does not match any of the specified structures. There is an 'if' statement checking 'shouldDistribute(shareholder)', but it
                  does not involve setting this condition directly to true or false, nor a requirement statement as described.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['address(shareholder).call{gas:3000,value:amount}()']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - address(shareholder).call{gas:3000,value:amount}() is subjected to gas limits 3000. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem.
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
