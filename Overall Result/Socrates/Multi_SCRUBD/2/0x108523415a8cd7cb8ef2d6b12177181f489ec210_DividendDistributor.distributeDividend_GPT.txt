Function Security Analysis for DividendDistributor.distributeDividend(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function distributeDividend.
    Check direct function security
        - function DividendDistributor.distributeDividend(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not check or assert the identity of msg.sender against any owner or specific address role before executing its logic.
        - function DividendDistributor.distributeDividend(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures that involve `require` or `if` checks with boolean assignments and conditionals as
          outlined. It only contains a condition that returns immediately if a specific condition is met (`if (shares[shareholder].amount == 0) { return; }`) but it
          doesn't set or update a boolean variable in the way specified by the provided characteristics.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['setShare', 'process', 'claimDividend']
        Function Security Analysis for DividendDistributor.setShare(address,uint256)
            The modifier of function setShare are ['onlyToken']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyToken is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The modifier enforces that only the address stored in 'token' can execute the function with the line 'require(msg.sender == token);'. This
                  matches rule 1.
        Function Security Analysis for DividendDistributor.process(uint256)
            The modifier of function process are ['onlyToken']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyToken is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The modifier enforces ownership by using 'require(msg.sender == token)', which checks if the sender is the specific address stored in 'token',
                  satisfying characteristic 1.
        Function Security Analysis for DividendDistributor.claimDividend(address)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function claimDividend.
            Check direct function security
                - function DividendDistributor.claimDividend(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any access control checks related to msg.sender such as require, if, or assert statements comparing msg.sender to
                  an owner, address, or role.
                - function DividendDistributor.claimDividend(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures.
