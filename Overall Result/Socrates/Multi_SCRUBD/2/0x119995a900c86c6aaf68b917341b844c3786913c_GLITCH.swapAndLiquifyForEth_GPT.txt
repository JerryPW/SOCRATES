Function Security Analysis for GLITCH.swapAndLiquifyForEth(uint256)
    The modifier of function swapAndLiquifyForEth are ['lockTheSwap']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier lockTheSwap is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The given modifier 'lockTheSwap' sets 'inSwapAndLiquify' to true and then resets it to false, showing both the lock and unlock operations. This matches
          the structure defined in rule 2 for a lock mechanism, where a flag is set to true before the main function runs and reset to false afterward.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _sendRewardInterestToPool.
    Check direct function security
        - function GLITCH._sendRewardInterestToPool() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not perform any checks or conditions related to the caller's address, like checking if msg.sender is a specific owner or leader, which
          is required by the given rules.
        - function GLITCH._sendRewardInterestToPool() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures with 'require' or 'if' involving a boolean variable.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transfer', 'swapAndLiquifyForEth', '_transfer', 'swapAndLiquifyForTokens', 'transferFrom']

            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transfer.
            Check direct function security
                - function GLITCH.transfer(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The given `transfer` function does not seem to check or require any conditions related to msg.sender and an owner/leader/CEO address. It uses
                  `_msgSender()`, likely for getting the message sender, but without context or relevant conditional checks based on the characteristics provided.
                - function GLITCH.transfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The given code snippet does not contain any of the specified structures that involve require statements checking a boolean variable or an if
                  statement checking "!xxx" followed by an assignment to the same variable. It only contains a call to a function and a return statement.

        There are ['currentPoolAddress'] should be checked in variable currentPoolAddress
        Checked variables: currentPoolAddress
            Yes The provided code includes a constructor function, as the function name matches the contract name 'GLITCH' and is declared explicitly as a constructor.
            Moreover, within this constructor, the state variable 'currentPoolAddress' is hardcoded as it is assigned a value directly using the UniswapV2Router instance
            and factory method. Therefore, the constructor satisfies both characteristics: being a constructor and hardcoding the 'currentPoolAddress' variable.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: GLITCH._transfer(address,address,uint256)
Function Security Analysis for GLITCH._transfer(address,address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _transfer.
    Check direct function security
        - function GLITCH._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code provided does not have any checks or conditions that directly involve 'msg.sender' being compared to `xxxOwner`, `xxxAddress`, `Leader`, or
          `CEO`. Thus, none of the specified structures are present.
        - function GLITCH._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not match any of the provided structures as it doesn't involve a `require` statement with a direct toggle between `true` and `false` for
          the same variable, nor does it use a throw and immediate toggle approach.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transfer', 'swapAndLiquifyForEth', 'swapAndLiquifyForTokens', '_transfer', 'transferFrom']

            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transfer.
            Check direct function security
                - function GLITCH.transfer(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The provided code does not have any condition that checks if 'msg.sender' is equal to a specific owner or leader address, nor any check using
                  assert or require with 'msg.sender'.
                - function GLITCH.transfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures such as 'require(xxx == True)', 'require(xxx == False)', 'require(!xxx)', or 'if(!xxx)
                  throw'. The function strictly focuses on transferring an amount and then returning true without the logical requirement checks or state changes
                  specified.

Start analyze function: GLITCH.swapAndLiquifyForTokens(address,uint256)
Function Security Analysis for GLITCH.swapAndLiquifyForTokens(address,uint256)
    The modifier of function swapAndLiquifyForTokens are ['lockTheSwap']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier lockTheSwap is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The modifier 'lockTheSwap' contains both a lock and unlock operation by setting the 'inSwapAndLiquify' flag to true before the function executes and
          false afterwards, ensuring that the function can only be entered once at a time. This satisfies rule 2 entirely as both operations are present and correctly
          implemented.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
