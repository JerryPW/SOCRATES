    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _withdrawAllSurcharges.
    Check direct function security
        - function WithdrawableV2._withdrawAllSurcharges() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any check involving 'msg.sender' against an owner or authority address.
        - function WithdrawableV2._withdrawAllSurcharges() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures such as 'require(xxx == True); xxx = False;', 'require(xxx == False); xxx = True;',
          'require(!xxx); xxx = True;', or 'if(!xxx) throw; xxx = true;'. It lacks the use of require statements with the subsequent setting of the same variable.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['withdrawRamppSurcharges', 'withdrawERC20']
        Function Security Analysis for WithdrawableV2.withdrawRamppSurcharges()
            The modifier of function withdrawRamppSurcharges are ['isRampp']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier isRampp is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The code in the modifier contains the statement 'require(msg.sender == RAMPPADDRESS, "Ownable: caller is not RAMPP");', which enforces that only
                  the specific address RAMPPADDRESS can execute the function. Therefore, it matches Rule 1. There are no structural omissions as this single condition is
                  sufficient for satisfying the requirement of enforcing execution by a specific address or owner.
        Function Security Analysis for WithdrawableV2.withdrawERC20(address,uint256)
            The modifier of function withdrawERC20 are ['onlyTeamOrOwner']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyTeamOrOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: Upon double-checking the provided code, it confirms that the modifier onlyTeamOrOwner includes a require statement: 'require(_isOwner ||
                  _isTeam, "Team: caller is not the owner or in Team.")'. This enforces that only the owner or team members can execute the function. Thus, it satisfies
                  the first characteristic of checking whether only specific addresses can execute the function.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
