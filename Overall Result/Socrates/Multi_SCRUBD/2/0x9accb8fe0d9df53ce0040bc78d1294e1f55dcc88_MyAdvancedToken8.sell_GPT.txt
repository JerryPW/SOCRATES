    There are no modifiers should be examined in function sell.
    Check direct function security
        - function MyAdvancedToken8.sell(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not include any checks or assertions for msg.sender being equal or different from any designated owner, address, Leader, CEO, or
          equivalent based on the given characteristics.
        - function MyAdvancedToken8.sell(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon reviewing the code carefully, the initial evaluation incorrectly identified the structure matching. For structure 3, we need to find both
          `require(!xxx)` and `xxx = true;`. In the provided code, there is no `require(!sendSUCCESS)`, although there is an `if (!sendSUCCESS)` which doesn't equate to
          using `require`. The code checks for the negation of a variable without explicitly using a `require` statement.  Thus, none of the required structures (1 to 4)
          are fully matched in the code as they all necessitate usage of the keyword `require` or `throw`, combined with subsequent assignments which aren't fully
          present. Hence the correct answer is 'No'.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['msg.sender.send(amount*sellPrice)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - msg.sender.send(amount*sellPrice) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the
        '.send(' keyword: msg.sender.send(amount*sellPrice).. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
