Function Security Analysis for CUELauncherToken.v1AirdropETH()
    The modifier of function v1AirdropETH are ['onlyOwner']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: Upon reviewing the code, the modifier 'onlyOwner' includes the statement 'require(_owner == _msgSender())', which directly checks if the caller of the
          function is the owner. This corresponds explicitly to the first rule that checks whether the code enforces that only the owner or specific addresses can execute
          the function. There are no structural omissions as the complete condition is evaluated within a single 'require' statement. Furthermore, there are no
          indications of lock operations which are required for rule 2, so this rule is not applicable here. Thus, the answer still adheres to Rule 1.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
