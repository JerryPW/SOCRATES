Function Security Analysis for SafeDif.distributeRef(uint256,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function distributeRef.
    Check direct function security
        - function SafeDif.distributeRef(uint256,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified patterns such as `require`, conditional checks using `if` for `msg.sender`, or `assert` involving
          `msg.sender`. It only performs checks and operations related to affiliate distribution without using `msg.sender` validation in the required context.
        - function SafeDif.distributeRef(uint256,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not match any of the required structures. It performs a set of operations involving calculations and transfers but does not
          include the conditional requirement statements mentioned in any of the specified structures.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['fallback', 'invest']
        Function Security Analysis for SafeDif.fallback()
            The modifier of function fallback are ['isActivated']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier isActivated has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier 'isActivated()' checks a variable 'activated_' to determine if it is true. It does not enforce that only the owner or specific
                  addresses can execute the function, and there is no lock operation. The name 'isActivated' does not suggest ownership control or reentrancy protection
                  either. Therefore, none of the conditions are met.
            Check direct function security
                - function SafeDif.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code snippet does not contain any checks that refer to msg.sender being equal or not equal to an xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO as specified
                  in the criteria.
                - function SafeDif.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures. There is no variable that is being checked for true or false, modified, and then
                  optionally reverted back.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['player_[_affID1].addr.transfer(_aff)', 'player_[_affID2].addr.transfer(_aff)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - player_[_affID1].addr.transfer(_aff) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains
        '.transfer(' keyword which matches the first rule.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - player_[_affID2].addr.transfer(_aff) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains
        '.transfer(' keyword which matches the first rule.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
