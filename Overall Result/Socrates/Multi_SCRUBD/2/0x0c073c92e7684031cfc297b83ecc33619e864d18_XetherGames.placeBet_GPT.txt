    There are no modifiers should be examined in function placeBet.
    Check direct function security
        - function XetherGames.placeBet(uint256,uint32,uint256,uint256,uint256,bytes32,bytes32) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of
        msg.sender
          Reason: The smart contract code does not contain any checks or assertions involving 'msg.sender' equality or inequality with a specified 'Owner', 'Address',
          'Leader', or 'CEO'. It mainly contains 'require' statements for conditions like 'amount', 'modulo', and signature validation, but none of these compare
          'msg.sender' explicitly against a specific address of a higher authority or role.
        - function XetherGames.placeBet(uint256,uint32,uint256,uint256,uint256,bytes32,bytes32) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not explicitly contain any of the specified 'require' structures followed by reassignment as described. The requires are individually
          placed, with no logical progression from a require of a boolean value followed by its opposite assignment or throwing exceptions. None of the characteristic
          patterns outlined in the instructions are present.

Function Security Analysis for XetherGames.sendDividends()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function sendDividends.
    Check direct function security
        - function XetherGames.sendDividends() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: None of the specified patterns (1-4) related to msg.sender checks are present in the function.
        - function XetherGames.sendDividends() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not match any of the specified structures as it does not contain any 'require' or 'throw' statements that check a condition. It
          lacks the specific conditional checking structure combined with state modification that is necessary to satisfy any of the characteristics.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['xEtherTokensContract.ecosystemDividends.value(tmpDividends)()']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - xEtherTokensContract.ecosystemDividends.value(tmpDividends)() ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['xEtherTokensContract.ecosystemDividends.value(tmpDividends)()']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['xEtherTokensContract'] should be checked in variable xEtherTokensContract
        Checked variables: xEtherTokensContract
            No 1. The function name 'setXEtherContract' does not match the contract name 'XetherGames', nor is it explicitly named 'constructor'. Therefore, it is not a
            constructor function.  2. The function does not hardcode the state variable 'xEtherTokensContract'; instead, it assigns it based on the input parameter
            'xEtherContract'.  Since none of the conditions are met, the output is 'No'.
            Function Security Analysis for XetherGames.setXEtherContract(address)
                The modifier of function setXEtherContract are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The code in the modifier has a 'require' statement checking 'msg.sender == owner', which matches the first characteristic of enforcing
                      execution by only the owner.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
