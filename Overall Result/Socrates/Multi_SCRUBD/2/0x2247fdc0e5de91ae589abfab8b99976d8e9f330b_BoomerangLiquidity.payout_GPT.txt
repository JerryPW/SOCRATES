    There are no modifiers should be examined in function payout.
    Check direct function security
        - function BoomerangLiquidity.payout() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not include any statements that restrict function execution based on the `msg.sender`. There are no checks for equality or inequality with
          specific addresses or roles like Owner, Address, Leader, or CEO.
        - function BoomerangLiquidity.payout() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code contains a 'require(balance > 1);' statement. None of the listed patterns apply to this code since it does not use a variable in a matched
          require or if-throw pattern with subsequent assignments to True or False.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.call.value(payoutToSend).gas(1000000)()', 'flmContract.buy.value(investment)(msg.sender)']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - The gas limit in participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.call.value(payoutToSend).gas(1000000)() is 1000000, which is too high. Therefore, it will not prevent
        REE problem.
        - flmContract.buy.value(investment)(msg.sender) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.call.value(payoutToSend).gas(1000000)()', 'flmContract.buy.value(investment)(msg.sender)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['participants'] should be checked in variable participants
        Checked variables: participants
            No The provided functions do not meet any of the specified characteristics. The function in question does not have a name matching the contract name
            'BoomerangLiquidity', nor is it a constructor labeled explicitly as 'constructor'. Moreover, the 'participants' state variable is used within the code, but it
            is not hardcoded with any fixed values. The functions operate on 'participants' by performing operations based on incoming 'msg.sender' and 'msg.value',
            dynamically modifying the state variable rather than hardcoding it.
            Function Security Analysis for BoomerangLiquidity.deposit()
                There are no modifiers should be examined in function deposit.
                Check direct function security
                    - function BoomerangLiquidity.deposit() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                      Reason: The code checks for 'msg.sender', but it does not compare it against any specific owner or leader address as per the listed structures.
                    - function BoomerangLiquidity.deposit() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                      Reason: The function 'deposit' does not contain any of the specified structure patterns. It does not have any require statement or if check with
                      throw that manipulates a boolean variable as per the given criteria.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
