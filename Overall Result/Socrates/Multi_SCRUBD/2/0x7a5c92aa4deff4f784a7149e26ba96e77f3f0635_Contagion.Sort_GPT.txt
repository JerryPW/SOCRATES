Start analyze function: Contagion.Sort()
Function Security Analysis for Contagion.Sort()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function Sort.
    Check direct function security
        - function Contagion.Sort() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not have any checks, assertions, or conditions involving msg.sender against ownership or leadership variables like xxxOwner, xxxAddress,
          Leader, or CEO.
        - function Contagion.Sort() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code doesn't contain any of the specified structures with require or if statements involving boolean variables being set to both true and false.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['fallback']
        Function Security Analysis for Contagion.fallback()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
            Check direct function security
                - function Contagion.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures involving 'msg.sender' with roles like xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO.
                - function Contagion.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code uses require(msg.value>=0.01 ether) which does not match any of the given structures. The variable modification pattern is absent.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['owner.send(feecounter)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - owner.send(feecounter) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the '.send('
        keyword, which matches the second characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
