Function Security Analysis for LockingContract.releaseTokens(address)
    The modifier of function releaseTokens are ['onlyWhenUnlocked']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier onlyWhenUnlocked has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier onlyWhenUnlocked uses the function isLocked() to determine the condition of being unlocked, which suggests a locking mechanism. However, to
          satisfy rule 2, both a lock and unlock operation must be present in the code structure. Since only a single operation (checking if unlocked) is present here, it
          does not fully satisfy rule 2.
    Check direct function security
        - function LockingContract.releaseTokens(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code uses 'require(msg.sender == owner || msg.sender == _beneficiary);', but the 'owner' is not prefixed by a specific local variable (xxxOwner),
          making it not strictly matching the structure.
        - function LockingContract.releaseTokens(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the mentioned structures 1-4 involving require statements or variable assignments in the specified patterns.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['tokenContract.transfer(_beneficiary,amount)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - tokenContract.transfer(_beneficiary,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - tokenContract.transfer(_beneficiary,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['tokenContract.transfer(_beneficiary,amount)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['tokenContract'] should be checked in variable tokenContract
        Checked variables: tokenContract
            Yes The function 'LockingContract' matches the name of the contract 'LockingContract'. Thus, it can be identified as a constructor in Solidity version prior
            to 0.4.22, where constructor functions were named after the contract.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
