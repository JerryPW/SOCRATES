Function Security Analysis for AIDOGEX._transfer(address,address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _transfer.
    Check direct function security
        - function AIDOGEX._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures that check or assert the identity of 'msg.sender' against an owner, address, leader, or CEO.
        - function AIDOGEX._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code doesn't contain any 'require(xxx == True)' or 'require(xxx == False)' or 'require(!xxx)' or 'if(!xxx) throw' structure that matches the given
          patterns.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transfer', 'transferFrom']
        Function Security Analysis for AIDOGEX.transfer(address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transfer.
            Check direct function security
                - function AIDOGEX.transfer(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not have any of the specified structures related to checking 'msg.sender' against xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
                - function AIDOGEX.transfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The given code snippet does not contain any 'require' statements to check conditions, nor does it contain a 'throw' statement. Additionally,
                  there are no instances of setting the same variable to 'True' or 'False' before or after a condition. Thus, it does not match any of the specified
                  structural patterns.

        There are ['uniswapV2Router'] should be checked in variable uniswapV2Router
        Checked variables: uniswapV2Router
            Yes The function in the provided code is explicitly named 'constructor', indicating it is a constructor function according to the specified characteristic.
        There are ['marketingWallet'] should be checked in variable marketingWallet
        Checked variables: marketingWallet
            Yes 1. The provided code contains a constructor for the contract, which is explicitly named 'constructor'. This matches criterion 1 because the function is
            identified as a constructor.   2. The constructor in the code also explicitly assigns a hardcoded value to the state variable 'marketingWallet' with the
            address '0xF88Db7a0e6fA4f0a36Bfc0e71AcC3F587aCCd700', which satisfies criterion 2 as well.  The condition for outputting 'Yes' is met if any one of the above
            conditions is satisfied, and here both are satisfied.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Function Security Analysis for AIDOGEX.buybackAndBurn(uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function buybackAndBurn.
    Check direct function security
        - function AIDOGEX.buybackAndBurn(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any checks or conditions related to msg.sender for xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO, as specified in the given
          characteristics.
        - function AIDOGEX.buybackAndBurn(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given function code does not contain any requirement or if statements related to True/False checks and corresponding assignments, according to the
          defined structures. Therefore, it does not meet any of the criteria.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transfer.
            Check direct function security
                - function AIDOGEX.transfer(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function provided does not contain any conditional statements or assertions that involve checking msg.sender against any owner or leader
                  variable, nor does it have a require or assert statement checking msg.sender's identity.
                - function AIDOGEX.transfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code snippet does not contain any of the specified structures. It performs a transfer operation and returns true, but it does not
                  have require statements or any conditions that match the given structures.

        There are ['uniswapV2Router'] should be checked in variable uniswapV2Router
        Checked variables: uniswapV2Router
            Yes The provided code snippet contains a function named 'constructor', which matches the typical pattern for a constructor in Solidity. Constructors do not
            have a specified return type and have the same name as the contract or are explicitly named 'constructor' in modern Solidity versions. Therefore, the function
            satisfies the first characteristic.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
