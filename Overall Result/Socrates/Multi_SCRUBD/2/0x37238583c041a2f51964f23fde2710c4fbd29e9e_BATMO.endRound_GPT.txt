Function Security Analysis for BATMO.endRound(BATMODatasets.EventReturns)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function endRound.
    Check direct function security
        - function BATMO.endRound(BATMODatasets.EventReturns) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures that involve checking msg.sender against an owner, address, or leader role using require, if,
          or assert statements as listed.
        - function BATMO.endRound(BATMODatasets.EventReturns) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures, such as 'require(xxx == True)', 'require(xxx == False)', 'require(!xxx)', or
          'if(!xxx) throw' followed by setting 'xxx = True/False'. The function primarily handles financial calculations and conditional logic for game events without
          involving the specific patterns outlined in the instructions.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['buyCore', 'reLoadXname', 'buyXid', 'reLoadCore', 'fallback', 'reLoadXaddr', 'buyXaddr', 'withdraw', 'buyXname', 'reLoadXid']

            There are no modifiers should be examined in function buyCore.
            Check direct function security
                - function BATMO.buyCore(uint256,uint256,BATMODatasets.EventReturns) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified security checks related to msg.sender and owner roles.
                - function BATMO.buyCore(uint256,uint256,BATMODatasets.EventReturns) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures with the 'require' keyword or 'if(!xxx) throw'.
            Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
            The reachable functions are ['buyXname', 'buyXid', 'buyXaddr', 'fallback']
                Function Security Analysis for BATMO.buyXname(bytes32)
                    The modifier of function buyXname are ['isActivated', 'isHuman', 'isWithinLimits']
                    The result of checking modifiers:
                        - modifier isActivated has no relation with controlled by owner.
                          Reason: This modifier checks a flag (activated_) to determine if the function can execute, but it does not enforce ownership or address
                          restriction, nor does it directly implement a lock mechanism (entering only once). It is not based on control by a specific address or a lock
                          operation by its function name or code.
                        - modifier isHuman has no relation with controlled by owner.
                          Reason: The modifier does not explicitly enforce ownership or address-based restrictions (criteria 1). It also doesn't implement any lock
                          mechanism (criteria 2), and the modifier name 'isHuman' does not imply ownership checks or reentrancy guards (criteria 3). Thus, none of the
                          specified characteristics apply.
                        - modifier isWithinLimits has no relation with controlled by owner.
                          Reason: The modifier isWithinLimits only checks for a value range of a parameter and does not fulfill any of the rules: it does not enforce
                          owner access or specific addresses, does not use a lock operation, nor can it be inferred by the modifier name alone to be involved with access
                          control or reentrancy prevention.
                    Check direct function security
                        - function BATMO.buyXname(bytes32) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                          Reason: The code provided does not contain any access control checks for msg.sender related to owner, address, leader or CEO.
                        - function BATMO.buyXname(bytes32) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures. It involves assignments and checks but does not include require or
                          throw statements that meet the criteria.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['admin2.transfer(_dev/2)', 'address(ObokContract).call.value(_OBOK.sub((_OBOK/3).mul(2)))(bytes4(keccak256()(donateDivs())))',
    'admin.transfer(_dev/2)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - admin2.transfer(_dev/2) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: This external call contains the '.transfer('
        keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - admin.transfer(_dev/2) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: This external call contains the '.transfer('
        keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - address(ObokContract).call.value(_OBOK.sub((_OBOK/3).mul(2)))(bytes4(keccak256()(donateDivs()))) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['address(ObokContract).call.value(_OBOK.sub((_OBOK/3).mul(2)))(bytes4(keccak256()(donateDivs())))']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['ObokContract'] should be checked in variable ObokContract
        Checked variables: ObokContract
            Yes The provided code is a constructor with the name 'constructor', which is explicitly mentioned, aligning with characteristic 1.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
