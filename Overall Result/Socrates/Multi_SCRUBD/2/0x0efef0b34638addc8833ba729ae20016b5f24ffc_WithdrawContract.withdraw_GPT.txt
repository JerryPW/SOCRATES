            There are no modifiers should be examined in function withdraw.
            Check direct function security
                - function WithdrawContract.withdraw() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code provided does not utilize msg.sender in any authorization checks such as requiring, asserting, or throwing based on msg.sender being a
                  particular owner or leadership role.
                - function WithdrawContract.withdraw() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures. There's no use of 'require' with changing the state of the same variable from
                  'True' to 'False' or vice versa. Additionally, the conditional statements don't execute state changes as described in the characteristics.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['_token.transfer(_dest,_amount)', '_dest.send(_amount)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - _token.transfer(_dest,_amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - _dest.send(_amount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call '_dest.send(_amount)' contains
        the '.send(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - _token.transfer(_dest,_amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['_token.transfer(_dest,_amount)']
    Analyze External Address
        The variable '_token' in external call '_token.transfer(_dest,_amount)' has no state variable assigned in
        WithdrawContract.doPayment(uint256,address,ERC20,uint256). Considering that it is an internal/private function, we analyze the function inputs.
        Analyze External Address
            There are ['deposits'] should be checked in variable currentToken
            Checked variables: deposits
                No The functions provided are neither constructers nor do they contain hardcoded state variables. The functions `newEtherDeposit`, `newTokenDeposit`, and
                `cancelPaymentGlobally` don't match the contract name `WithdrawContract`, nor are they explicitly named 'constructor'. Also, the state variable 'deposits'
                is not hardcoded in the sense of having a fixed, pre-defined value directly in the code that cannot be changed during execution.
            Function Security Analysis for WithdrawContract.newEtherDeposit(uint256)
                The modifier of function newEtherDeposit are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The code contains the statement 'require(msg.sender == owner);', which enforces that only the owner can execute functions using this
                      modifier. This satisfies characteristic 1. There are no additional structural omissions or matches needed based on the provided code.
            Function Security Analysis for WithdrawContract.newTokenDeposit(ERC20,uint256,uint256)
                The modifier of function newTokenDeposit are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The code uses 'require(msg.sender == owner);' to enforce that only the owner can execute the function, which satisfies the first
                      characteristic.
            Function Security Analysis for WithdrawContract.cancelPaymentGlobally(uint256)
                The modifier of function cancelPaymentGlobally are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The modifier 'onlyOwner' contains a single require statement checking if msg.sender is equal to owner, which matches the first
                      characteristic. There are no structural omissions here related to lock operations as it is specifically fulfilling characteristic one.
            There are ['deposits'] should be checked in variable currentToken
            Checked variables: deposits
                No The code provided consists of three functions: newEtherDeposit, newTokenDeposit, and cancelPaymentGlobally. None of these functions have the same name
                as the contract name, 'WithdrawContract', nor are they explicitly named 'constructor'. Therefore, they do not satisfy the first characteristic.
                Additionally, the state variable 'deposits' is used and modified in the code (e.g., its length is incremented), but it is not hardcoded with a specific
                value. Therefore, the functions do not satisfy the second characteristic.
            Function Security Analysis for WithdrawContract.newEtherDeposit(uint256)
                The modifier of function newEtherDeposit are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: Upon double-checking, the code for the modifier uses a require statement which matches rule 1 for ensuring only the owner can execute the
                      function. The relevant part of the code is 'require (msg.sender == owner);'. There are no omissions since there is no lock operation related to rule
                      2.
            Function Security Analysis for WithdrawContract.newTokenDeposit(ERC20,uint256,uint256)
                The modifier of function newTokenDeposit are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: Rule 1: The code in the modifier enforces that only the owner can execute the function by using the statement 'require(msg.sender ==
                      owner)'. There are no structural omissions as this single statement sufficiently ensures only the owner can run the function, conforming to Rule 1.
            Function Security Analysis for WithdrawContract.cancelPaymentGlobally(uint256)
                The modifier of function cancelPaymentGlobally are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The modifier code 'require(msg.sender == owner);' explicitly checks if the caller of the function is the owner, fulfilling the first
                      characteristic condition that enforces execution only by the owner.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
