Function Security Analysis for BatchSwap.cancelSwapIntent(uint256)
    The modifier of function cancelSwapIntent are ['nonReentrant']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier nonReentrant is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: Upon reviewing the code, it is clear that the `nonReentrant` modifier includes both a lock and unlock operation, satisfying the second characteristic.
          The code snippet uses '_status' to manage reentrancy protection. Initially, it checks if `_status` is not `_ENTERED` to allow execution, sets `_status` to
          `_ENTERED` (lock), executes the function body represented by `_`, and then resets `_status` to `_NOT_ENTERED` (unlock) after execution. Hence, the full locking
          mechanism is indeed present.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
