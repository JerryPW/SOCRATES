Function Security Analysis for BrokerV2.bid(uint256,address,uint256)
    The modifier of function bid are ['onSaleOnly', 'activeAuction']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier onSaleOnly has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier 'onSaleOnly' does not contain logic that restricts execution to specific addresses like an owner or manager, nor does it include lock
          mechanisms or operation patterns. It only enforces a condition based on a token's sale status. Hence, it does not satisfy any of the characteristics provided
          for judgment.
        - modifier activeAuction has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier does not enforce any owner-specific or address-specific restrictions, nor does it include any evident lock mechanism. It solely checks if
          the current time is before the auction closing time.
    Check direct function security
        - function BrokerV2.bid(uint256,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not have any checks that restrict actions based on msg.sender being a specific owner, address, leader, or CEO.
        - function BrokerV2.bid(uint256,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon re-evaluation, the code does not fully satisfy the required structures. It uses '_auction.buyer == true' only within an 'if' statement but never
          assigns '_auction.buyer = false;' as the second necessary part of the pattern that either changes to True or from True is missing. None of the structures 1, 2,
          3 or 4, requiring both conditional and assignment operations in a specific order, are fulfilled here.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['Token.safeTransferFrom(Token.ownerOf(tokenID),address(this),tokenID)', '_auction.highestBidder.transfer(_auction.currentBid)',
    'erc20Token.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),amount)', 'erc20Token.transfer(_auction.highestBidder,_auction.currentBid)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - _auction.highestBidder.transfer(_auction.currentBid) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external
        call '_auction.highestBidder.transfer(_auction.currentBid)' contains '.transfer(' keyword. As per the instructions, this satisfies the given characteristics..
        Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - erc20Token.transfer(_auction.highestBidder,_auction.currentBid) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - Token.safeTransferFrom(Token.ownerOf(tokenID),address(this),tokenID) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - erc20Token.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - erc20Token.transfer(_auction.highestBidder,_auction.currentBid) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['Token.safeTransferFrom(Token.ownerOf(tokenID),address(this),tokenID)', 'erc20Token.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),amount)',
    'erc20Token.transfer(_auction.highestBidder,_auction.currentBid)']
    Analyze External Address
        The variable 'Token' in external call 'Token.safeTransferFrom(Token.ownerOf(tokenID),address(this),tokenID)' has no state variable assigned in
        BrokerV2.bid(uint256,address,uint256). Therefore we check whether it has been hardcoded in the function.
            No The variable '_mintableToken' is used as a parameter to the function 'bid'. It is used to identify the specific token being auctioned and is not assigned
            or defined within the function itself. Instead, its value comes from the argument provided each time the function is called. The function retrieves
            information like the auction details from '_mintableToken', making no assumptions or hardcoding about its value. Therefore, '_mintableToken' is not hardcoded
            within the function.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
