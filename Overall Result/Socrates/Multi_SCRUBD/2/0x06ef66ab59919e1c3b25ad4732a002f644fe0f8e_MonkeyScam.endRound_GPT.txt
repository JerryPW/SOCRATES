    There are no modifiers should be examined in function endRound.
    Check direct function security
        - function MonkeyScam.endRound(LDdatasets.EventReturns) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any conditions checking against msg.sender to compare it with an owner, address, leader, or CEO. Thus, it does not satisfy
          any of the specified conditions.
        - function MonkeyScam.endRound(LDdatasets.EventReturns) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified patterns where a `require` or `if(!xxx) throw;` statement is directly followed by modifying the same
          variable.  Specifically, the patterns described require a certain condition on a variable followed by changing the value of that same variable, possibly with
          the final change being reversed optionally. However, neither the `require` nor the `if` conditions in the given code follow this structure.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['withdraw', 'reLoadXid', 'buyXid', 'reLoadCore', 'reLoadXname', 'buyXname', 'fallback', 'buyCore', 'reLoadXaddr', 'buyXaddr']
        Function Security Analysis for MonkeyScam.withdraw()
            The modifier of function withdraw are ['isActivated', 'isHuman']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier isActivated has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier checks if 'activated_' is true, but it does not enforce a specific owner or address restriction, nor does it appear to implement a
                  lock mechanism or have a descriptive name like Onlyxxx or nonReentrant, based on the provided code.
                - modifier isHuman has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier checks if the sender is a non-smart contract address by verifying the code size, which does not match any of the specified
                  characteristics like ownership checks or lock operations.
            Check direct function security
                - function MonkeyScam.withdraw() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain any checks related to msg.sender being compared to xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO using the specified structures.
                - function MonkeyScam.withdraw() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the required structures mentioned in the problem statement. There is no usage of 'require' statements or
                  conditional checks throwing exceptions with state changes for the same variable as specified.
