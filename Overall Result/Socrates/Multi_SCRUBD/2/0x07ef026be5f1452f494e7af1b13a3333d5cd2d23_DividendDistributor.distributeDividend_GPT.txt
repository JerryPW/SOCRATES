Function Security Analysis for DividendDistributor.distributeDividend(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function distributeDividend.
    Check direct function security
        - function DividendDistributor.distributeDividend(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not check the sender's address against any specific owner or leader addresses with assert, require, or if-else statements.
        - function DividendDistributor.distributeDividend(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code doesn't contain any of the specified structures involving require statements or conditionals setting a boolean state explicitly. It operates
          with conditionals but not in the specified pattern.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['process', 'claimDividend', 'setShare']
        Function Security Analysis for DividendDistributor.process(uint256)
            The modifier of function process are ['onlyToken']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyToken is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The code in the modifier enforces that only the address _token can execute the function, as it checks if msg.sender is equal to _token using
                  "require(msg.sender == _token);". This satisfies rule 1.
        Function Security Analysis for DividendDistributor.claimDividend()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function claimDividend.
            Check direct function security
                - function DividendDistributor.claimDividend() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any privilege checks based on the caller's address (msg.sender). It does not include any of the specified
                  structures for checking or requiring a specific address.
                - function DividendDistributor.claimDividend() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The function does not match any of the given structures. It simply calls another function without any condition or state change.

    Analyze Transfer
        - EP.transfer(shareholder,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - EP.transfer(shareholder,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['EP.transfer(shareholder,amount)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['EP'] should be checked in variable EP
        Checked variables: EP
            State variable EP has initialized in public area after declaration.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
