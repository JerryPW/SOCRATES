Function Security Analysis for Dividends.fallback()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
    Check direct function security
        - function Dividends.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code contains an if condition checking if admins[msg.sender] != 1, which doesn't exactly match the specific pattern required. The code checks if the
          sender is not an admin, but it doesn't check against variables like xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO.
        - function Dividends.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not have any require statements or throw related to a boolean condition, nor does it reassign a boolean variable from true to false or
          vice versa in the structures described.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['tokenReward.balanceOf(user)', 'user.transfer(userether)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - user.transfer(userether) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call 'user.transfer(userether)'
        contains the keyword '.transfer('.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - tokenReward.balanceOf(user) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['tokenReward.balanceOf(user)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['tokenReward'] should be checked in variable tokenReward
        Checked variables: tokenReward
            Yes The code provided is a constructor for the "Dividends" contract because the function name matches the contract name, which is the pattern used in earlier
            versions of Solidity to define constructors.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
