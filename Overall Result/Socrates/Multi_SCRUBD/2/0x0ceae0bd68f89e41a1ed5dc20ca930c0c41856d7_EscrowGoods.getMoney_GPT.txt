Function Security Analysis for EscrowGoods.getMoney(uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function getMoney.
    Check direct function security
        - function EscrowGoods.getMoney(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not have any of the specified structures where conditions related to msg.sender are checked with respect to certain roles like xxxOwner,
          xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO.
        - function EscrowGoods.getMoney(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any structure that matches the descriptions given for judging. There is no use of 'require' or 'if' with 'throw' in
          relation to setting a boolean variable to True or False as specified by the structures required for a 'Yes'.

Start analyze function: EscrowGoods.safeSend(address,uint256)
Function Security Analysis for EscrowGoods.safeSend(address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function safeSend.
    Check direct function security
        - function EscrowGoods.safeSend(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any checks or assertions involving msg.sender. It only modifies and checks the atomicLock variable and performs a call
          operation to a specified address with a certain gas limit.
        - function EscrowGoods.safeSend(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code matches structure 4 with 'if(atomicLock) throw;' and 'atomicLock = true;'. However, the negation 'atomicLock = false;' occurs after the main
          logic, which is the call to 'addr.call'. The negation does not occur immediately after setting 'atomicLock = true;' and before executing the function's main
          logic. Thus, it does not satisfy the requirement of negating the state immediately after checking and before moving into the main logic.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['reject', 'arbYes', 'yes', 'getMoney', 'getFees']
        Function Security Analysis for EscrowGoods.reject(uint256,string,uint256)
            The modifier of function reject are ['onlyOwner']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The code explicitly checks if msg.sender (the person calling the function) is not equal to seller and throws an exception if it isn't, ensuring
                  that only the seller can execute the function. This matches the first characteristic where only specific addresses can execute it.
        Function Security Analysis for EscrowGoods.arbYes(uint256,address,uint256,string,uint256)
            The modifier of function arbYes are ['onlyArbiter']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyArbiter is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The modifier code checks if the 'msg.sender' is not equal to 'arbiter' and throws if not, which aligns with rule 1 where access is restricted to
                  a specific address ('arbiter'). There are no omissions as rule 1 has been correctly identified and applied.
        Function Security Analysis for EscrowGoods.yes(uint256,string,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function yes.
            Check direct function security
                - function EscrowGoods.yes(uint256,string,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function uses 'msg.sender != info.buyer && msg.sender != seller' which is checking against buyers and sellers from the contract data, but
                  does not conform to any of the defined structures based on specific roles like xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO that are not derived from local variables.
                - function EscrowGoods.yes(uint256,string,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code does not contain the specific structure outlined in any of the given characteristics, such as requiring a boolean to be
                  checked and set within the conditions specified (like require(xxx == True), xxx = False; etc.). The code involves checks based on conditions around
                  'lockedFunds' and 'msg.sender', but these do not align with any specified pattern involving a boolean variable being toggled.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['addr.call.gas(safeGas).value(value)()']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - addr.call.gas(safeGas).value(value)() ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Here is the reason: In the provided code, the `safeGas` variable is declared as a constant
        with the value 25000:  ```solidity uint constant safeGas = 25000; ```  This is the only place where the `safeGas` variable is defined and assigned. Since it is
        declared as a constant, its value cannot be changed anywhere in the contract. As a constant variable, the value of `safeGas` is fixed at 25000 and cannot increase
        or decrease during the contract's execution. Thus, it is always less than or equal to 3000.  Checking the rest of the code, no other assignments or functions
        modify the `safeGas` variable. Therefore, its assignment is always 25000, which is less than 3000, leading to the consistent conclusion across the contract's
        lifespan.
    Remaining external call: ['addr.call.gas(safeGas).value(value)()']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['seller', 'arbiter'] should be checked in variable addr
        Checked variables: seller
            Yes The provided code is a constructor for the contract named 'EscrowGoods'. The function name matches the contract name, which indicates that it is a
            constructor. Additionally, the state variable 'seller' is being hardcoded to the value of 'msg.sender'. Therefore, it satisfies both characteristics: it is a
            constructor, and it hardcodes the 'seller' state variable.
        Checked variables: arbiter
            Yes The function provided in the code is named 'EscrowGoods', which matches the contract name. This indicates that the function is a constructor, satisfying
            characteristic 1.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
