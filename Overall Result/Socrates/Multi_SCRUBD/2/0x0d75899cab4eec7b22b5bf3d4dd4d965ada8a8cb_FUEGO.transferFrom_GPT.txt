Function Security Analysis for FUEGO.transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function transferFrom.
    Check direct function security
        - function FUEGO.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specific structures checking msg.sender against an owner or leader variable.
        - function FUEGO.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not match any of the listed patterns. It includes a require statement but does not directly change a boolean variable from true to
          false or false to true after the require statement.

Start analyze function: FUEGO._transfer(address,address,uint256)
Function Security Analysis for FUEGO._transfer(address,address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _transfer.
    Check direct function security
        - function FUEGO._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any checks or assertions involving `msg.sender`. All the require checks and conditional statements involve other aspects of
          the transaction, such as addressing, amounts, and flags like `tradeEnabled` and `limitsInEffect`. The structures needed are not present.
        - function FUEGO._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified patterns in the outlined structures. Although there are conditions and assignments, none follow
          the pattern of 'require(xxx); xxx = !xxx;'. Specifically, there's no variable that is required to be a specific boolean value followed by its negation and an
          (optional) restoration to its original value as per the given structures.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transfer', '_transfer', 'transferFrom', 'swapForTokenomics']
        Function Security Analysis for FUEGO.transfer(address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transfer.
            Check direct function security
                - function FUEGO.transfer(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the specific patterns related to checking msg.sender's identity against xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO as
                  outlined in the conditions.
                - function FUEGO.transfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code provided does not match any of the given structures. It does not contain a require statement or an if condition that would throw if a
                  condition is false. It simply calls a function '_transfer' and returns true.

    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: FUEGO.swapForTokenomics(uint256)
Function Security Analysis for FUEGO.swapForTokenomics(uint256)
    The modifier of function swapForTokenomics are ['lockTheSwap']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier lockTheSwap is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The modifier 'lockTheSwap' includes both setting a flag 'inSwapAndLiquify' to true before the function executes and resetting it to false after the
          function completes, fulfilling the requirement for characteristic 2 to ensure the function can enter only once.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
