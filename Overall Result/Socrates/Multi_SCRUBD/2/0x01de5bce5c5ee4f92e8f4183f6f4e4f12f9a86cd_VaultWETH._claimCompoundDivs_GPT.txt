Function Security Analysis for VaultWETH._claimCompoundDivs()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _claimCompoundDivs.
    Check direct function security
        - function VaultWETH._claimCompoundDivs() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not include any checks on msg.sender being compared to any owner or leader address.
        - function VaultWETH._claimCompoundDivs() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not match any of the specified structures. There are 'require' statements, but they do not involve setting a variable to True or
          False, which are necessary conditions to fulfill any of the provided patterns.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['claim', 'claimCompoundDivs']
        Function Security Analysis for VaultWETH.claim(uint256)
            The modifier of function claim are ['noContractsAllowed', 'nonReentrant']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier noContractsAllowed has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier checks if the transaction origin (tx.origin) is equal to the message sender (msg.sender), which ensures that it's a direct call
                  from an external account rather than a contract. However, it doesn't fit any of the specific characteristics for 'owner enforcement' or 'lock operation'
                  as described.
                - modifier nonReentrant is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The modifier 'nonReentrant' uses a lock mechanism as indicated by the '_status' variable being set to '_ENTERED' and then reset to
                  '_NOT_ENTERED'. This implementation pattern satisfies rule 2, confirming both lock and unlock operations are present.
        Function Security Analysis for VaultWETH.claimCompoundDivs()
            The modifier of function claimCompoundDivs are ['noContractsAllowed', 'nonReentrant']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier noContractsAllowed has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier enforces that the function cannot be executed by contracts, but it doesn't explicitly enforce that only the owner or specific
                  addresses can execute it. Additionally, it doesn't include a lock operation or have a notable function name like Onlyxxx or nonReentrant.
                - modifier nonReentrant is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The code structure in the modifier uses the _status variable to enforce a lock before executing the main function body and resets it to the
                  original status at the end. Specifically, it checks if _status is not equal to _ENTERED with require(_status != _ENTERED, ...), sets _status to _ENTERED
                  before the main function, and resets it to _NOT_ENTERED afterward. This satisfies the lock operation requirement by setting a flag to true before the
                  function runs and resetting it to false afterward as outlined in characteristic 2.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
