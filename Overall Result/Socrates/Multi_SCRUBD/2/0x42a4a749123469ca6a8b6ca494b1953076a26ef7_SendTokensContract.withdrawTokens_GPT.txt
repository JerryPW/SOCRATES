    Analyze Gas
        - tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,bals[msg.sender]) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,bals[msg.sender])']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['tokenReward'] should be checked in variable tokenReward
        Checked variables: tokenReward
            No The provided code is for a function named 'setTokenReward'. The contract name is 'SendTokensContract' and the function name does not match it nor is it
            explicitly named as 'constructor', so it is not a constructor.   The function 'setTokenReward' does modify the state variable 'tokenReward', but it does not
            hardcode its value. Instead, it assigns the value based on a parameter '_tokenContractAddress'. Therefore, it does not satisfy the second characteristic
            either.
            Function Security Analysis for SendTokensContract.setTokenReward(address)
                The modifier of function setTokenReward are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: Rule 1 is satisfied because the modifier enforces that only the owner can execute the function with the line 'require(msg.sender ==
                      owner);'. This matches the requirement to check specific addresses for function execution.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
