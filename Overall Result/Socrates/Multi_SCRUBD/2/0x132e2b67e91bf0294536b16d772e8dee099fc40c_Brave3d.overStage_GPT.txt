    Check direct function security
        - function Brave3d.overStage(uint8) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not include any of the specified structures regarding 'msg.sender' checks.
        - function Brave3d.overStage(uint8) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Although the code matches Structure 3, the negation operation 'finishStage.isFinish = true;' is not performed immediately after the state check
          'assert(!finishStage.isFinish);'. Instead, it is after a substantial block of the logic within the function.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
