Function Security Analysis for Lottery10ETH.drawing()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function drawing.
    Check direct function security
        - function Lottery10ETH.drawing() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any 'require', 'if', or 'assert' statement checking directly or indirectly against 'msg.sender' related to ownership or
          specific addresses like 'Owner', 'Address', 'Leader', 'CEO'. Hence, none of the required structures are present.
        - function Lottery10ETH.drawing() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not contain any of the specified structures. It has 'require' statements, but none involve a boolean variable being set to True or
          False after the require statement. The require statement in this function checks if 'block.number' is greater than 'futureblock'. No boolean variable
          manipulation matching the specified patterns occurs related to these require statements.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['fallback']
        Function Security Analysis for Lottery10ETH.fallback()
            The modifier of function fallback are ['notFromContract']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier notFromContract has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier code checks if the sender is a contract, not specifically for ownership or specific addresses execution control, nor does it have a
                  lock mechanism as described in the characteristics.
            Check direct function security
                - function Lottery10ETH.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures that relate to checking if msg.sender is equal or not equal to xxxOwner, xxxAddress,
                  Leader, or CEO.
                - function Lottery10ETH.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not match any of the specified patterns exactly. There is no 'require(xxx == True)' followed by 'xxx = False', nor 'require(xxx ==
                  False)' followed by 'xxx = True'. It also doesn't use 'require(!xxx)' with 'xxx = True', or 'if(!xxx) throw' with 'xxx = true'. The 'require' statement
                  present in the code ('require(msg.value >= PRICE)') doesn't meet the given conditions because there is no reassignment of the same variable following
                  it.

    Analyze Transfer
        - owner.send(fee) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call 'owner.send(fee)' contains '.send('..
        Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - players[winnerIdx].send(brilliant[1]) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call
        'players[winnerIdx].send(brilliant[1])' contains '.send('.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - winner.send(silver[1]) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call 'winner.send(silver[1])' contains
        '.send('.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - addresses[k].send(goldenPrize) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call
        'addresses[k].send(goldenPrize)' contains '.send('.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - msg.sender.send(txCost) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call 'msg.sender.send(txCost)' contains
        '.send('.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - x.draw(goldenWinners) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - RS.sendBonus(addresses[k]) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.

    Analyze External Address
        There are ['x'] should be checked in variable x
        Checked variables: x
            Yes 1. The provided code is a constructor because it has the function signature 'constructor(address RS_Addr)'. This matches one of the characteristics we are
            looking for. 2. The function does not hardcode the state variable 'x'. It initializes 'x' with 'new Storage();', but it does not hardcode or set 'x' to a
            specific predefined value.
        There are ['RS'] should be checked in variable RS
        Checked variables: RS
            Yes The provided code snippet is a constructor because the function is explicitly named 'constructor'. This matches one of the characteristics we are looking
            for.
        There are ['WT'] should be checked in variable WT
        Checked variables: WT
            Yes The provided code contains a constructor function for the contract. The code explicitly names the function 'constructor', which matches one of the
            conditions to fulfill the requirement for being considered as a constructor. Therefore, it satisfies characteristic 1, where the function name is either the
            same as the contract name or explicitly named 'constructor'.
        There are ['x'] should be checked in variable x
        Checked variables: x
            Yes The provided code contains a function with the name 'constructor', which is explicitly defined as a constructor function. Constructors are special
            functions used to initialize state variables when the contract is deployed. Here, the constructor initializes several state variables such as 'x', 'LT', 'WT',
            and 'RS'. This matches the first characteristic mentioned, indicating that the function is indeed a constructor.  Additionally, we can see that there are
            instances of hardcoded state variables like 'x' in the 'drawing' function, where 'x' is reinitialized with 'new Storage()'. However, we do not need to further
            analyze for the second characteristic since the first one is already satisfied.
        There are ['WT'] should be checked in variable WT
        Checked variables: WT
            Yes The provided code is a constructor because the function name is 'constructor', which indicates it's a constructor by definition in Solidity. In this
            constructor, the state variable 'WT' is hardcoded with 'new WinnerTicket()'.
        There are ['WT'] should be checked in variable WT
        Checked variables: WT
            Yes The provided code snippet is a constructor because the function is explicitly named 'constructor'.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
