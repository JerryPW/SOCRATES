Function Security Analysis for PlanetCryptoToken.buyLand(bytes32,int256[],int256[],address)
    The modifier of function buyLand are ['validatePurchase', 'validateLand', 'updateUsersLastAccess']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier validatePurchase has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier does not strictly enforce any owner or specific address execution restrictions nor does it explicitly use a lock operation. It only calls a
          function to validate a purchase based on certain parameters. The modifier's function name doesn't suggest an ownership or lock nature either. Therefore, it does
          not meet any of the specified conditions.
        - modifier validateLand has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier does not include any specific checks enforcing ownership or address restrictions, nor does it use any clear lock mechanisms. The modifier
          function name is 'validateLand', which does not explicitly suggest ownership or reentrancy protection as per the naming conventions (like Onlyxxx or
          nonReentrant). Thus, none of the specified characteristics are met by this modifier.
        - modifier updateUsersLastAccess has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: There is no enforcement of ownership, specific address access, or locking mechanism in the modifier provided. It simply updates the last access time for
          a user.
    Check direct function security
        - function PlanetCryptoToken.buyLand(bytes32,int256[],int256[],address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The provided function code does not explicitly contain any of the listed structures that involve checking if msg.sender is or isn't equal to a specific
          owner/address/leader/CEO before executing critical actions. It focuses on payment processing and rewards distribution without ownership verification.
        - function PlanetCryptoToken.buyLand(bytes32,int256[],int256[],address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not have any of the defined structures that involve require or logical negation patterns mentioned in the characteristics. It uses a
          require statement to check if _name has length greater than 4, but this does not align with any of the specific structures defined in the task.

    There are no modifiers should be examined in function processDevPayment.
    Check direct function security
        - function PlanetCryptoToken.processDevPayment(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures involving 'msg.sender' checks against owner or similar roles.
        - function PlanetCryptoToken.processDevPayment(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any structure that matches the required patterns as described. It lacks directives or variables being explicitly
          required to be 'True' or 'False', either initially or through a conditional throw. The send function and checks are not related to setting or requiring any
          flags within the specified criteria.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

                - function PlanetCryptoToken.updateCardDetail(uint256,uint256,bytes32) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The existing check is require(msg.sender == ownerOf(_token_id)); and 'ownerOf' is likely a function call, not a strictly defined variable such
                  as xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
                - function PlanetCryptoToken.updateCardDetail(uint256,uint256,bytes32) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures. 1. There's no usage of the 'require(xxx == True); xxx = False;' structure. 2. There's
                  no usage of the 'require(xxx == False); xxx = True;' structure. 3. There's no usage of the 'require(!xxx); xxx = True;' structure. 4. There's no usage
                  of the 'if(!xxx) throw; xxx = true;' structure. The code contains require statements, but they are not setting any variable values afterwards. They only
                  check conditions related to msg.sender and msg.value.

    There are no modifiers should be examined in function processReferer.
    Check direct function security
        - function PlanetCryptoToken.processReferer(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not include any checks on msg.sender being equal to an owner, address, leader, or CEO, nor does it involve message sender inequality
          leading to a throw. It only checks if _referrer is not equal to msg.sender, which does not fit the specified conditions.
        - function PlanetCryptoToken.processReferer(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function `processReferer` does not contain any 'require' or 'if(!xxx) throw' statements, which means it does not match any of the provided
          structures. It does not check the validity of a variable against true or false values and then modify the same variable. It simply calculates, sends a payment,
          and emits an event without requiring specific entry or exit conditions based on a boolean variable.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['buyLand', 'buyCard']
        Function Security Analysis for PlanetCryptoToken.buyLand(bytes32,int256[],int256[],address)
            The modifier of function buyLand are ['validatePurchase', 'validateLand', 'updateUsersLastAccess']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier validatePurchase has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier does not contain any enforcement for specific addresses or owners to execute the function, nor does it mention any locking
                  mechanism. It only calls an external function to validate the purchase. Also, the modifier's name is not indicative of access control or non-reentrancy
                  features.
                - modifier validateLand has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: There is no specific check enforcing that only the owner or a specific address can execute the function, nor is there a locking mechanism
                  present. The modifier's name, 'validateLand', does not imply permission or reentrancy protection based on common naming conventions.
                - modifier updateUsersLastAccess has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier 'updateUsersLastAccess' does not explicitly enforce owner/specific address execution (like Require 1) or have any lock operation
                  (like Require 2), nor does its name imply any such restrictions or lock mechanisms (like Require 3). Thus, none of the conditions for 'Yes' are
                  satisfied.

                - function PlanetCryptoToken.buyLand(bytes32,int256[],int256[],address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: No authorization statement related to msg.sender being compared to an owner or authority address.
                - function PlanetCryptoToken.buyLand(bytes32,int256[],int256[],address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures. It has a single 'require' statement (`require(_name.length > 4);`), but does
                  not modify the checked logic variable ('_name') after the condition check as required by the given patterns.

    Check direct function security
        - function PlanetCryptoToken.processPurchase(bytes32,int256[],int256[]) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The provided function does not contain any of the specified structures that involve checks against specific addresses or roles for `msg.sender`. There
          are no authorization checks implemented using require, if, or assert statements with `msg.sender`.
        - function PlanetCryptoToken.processPurchase(bytes32,int256[],int256[]) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not contain any of the specified structures. There are no require statements checking if a boolean variable is true or false, and
          then setting it to the opposite, nor any conditional throw statements. Most of the logic revolves around arithmetic operations and event emissions.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

            The modifier of function buyLand are ['validatePurchase', 'validateLand', 'updateUsersLastAccess']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier validatePurchase has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier does not explicitly enforce ownership or specific address restrictions, nor does it use a lock mechanism. It primarily validates a
                  purchase through an external function. Additionally, the function name 'validatePurchase' does not suggest ownership control or non-reentrancy
                  protection by itself. Therefore, none of the specified characteristics are satisfied.
                - modifier validateLand has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier checks whether the land is already owned by calling a function from an external contract (planetCryptoUtils_interface). It does not
                  enforce any ownership or single-entry rule explicitly within its own code. It does not meet characteristics 1 or 2. Additionally, the function name does
                  not suggest any specific access control or locking mechanism as per characteristic 3.
                - modifier updateUsersLastAccess has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier does not include any code enforcing that only the owner or specific addresses can execute the function, nor does it use a lock
                  operation to prevent reentrancy. It simply updates user access-related data.
            Check direct function security
                - function PlanetCryptoToken.buyLand(bytes32,int256[],int256[],address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender

                - modifier validatePurchase has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier does not show any explicit ownership check or use a function name implying ownership. It also does not show any lock mechanism or
                  function name implying non-reentrant protection.
                - modifier validateLand has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier does not explicitly check for ownership or specific addresses, nor does it implement a lock mechanism. Also, the modifier's name
                  does not imply ownership restrictions or reentrancy protection.
                - modifier updateUsersLastAccess has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier updateUsersLastAccess does not have any ownership checks (e.g., msg.sender == owner) or lock mechanisms to restrict reentrancy. It
                  simply updates or adds a player's last access information without any specific access control or locking mechanism. Additionally, the modifier's name

        - function PlanetCryptoToken.setupZoomLvl(uint8,int256,int256,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any require statements or conditions where a boolean condition is checked and then altered as specified. The provided code is
          primarily performing mathematical operations and transformations on latitude and longitude variables without any of the specific boolean logic structures given
          in the characteristics.

                - modifier validatePurchase has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier does not explicitly include code to enforce that only the owner or specific addresses can execute the function, and there is no
                  lock operation visible in the code. Additionally, the modifier's function name 'validatePurchase' does not imply any owner-only or single-entry

                - modifier validateLand has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier does not indicate any owner-only or specific address execution enforcement, nor a lock operation mechanism is present. It merely
                  validates land ownership without restricting access to specific addresses or utilizing reentrancy protection.
                - modifier updateUsersLastAccess has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The code in the modifier does not enforce ownership or specific address restrictions. It also does not use a lock operation or has a name
