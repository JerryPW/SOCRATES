Function Security Analysis for Dex.trade(uint256,ERC20,uint256,ERC20,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function trade.
    Check direct function security
        - function Dex.trade(uint256,ERC20,uint256,ERC20,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified conditional checks or assertions related to msg.sender being an owner or specific role.
        - function Dex.trade(uint256,ERC20,uint256,ERC20,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the required structures as specified:   1. There is no use of `require(xxx == True);` followed by `xxx = False;` or
          `xxx = True;`. 2. There is no use of `require(xxx == False);` followed by `xxx = True;` or `xxx = False;`. 3. There is no use of `require(!xxx);` followed by
          `xxx = True;` or `xxx = False;`. 4. There is no use of `if(!xxx) throw;` followed by `xxx = true;` or `xxx = False;`.  Instead, the code uses `assert`
          statements to check conditions, which is different from the specified structures.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['src.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),srcAmount)', 'msg.sender.send(destAmount)', 'dest.transfer(msg.sender,destAmount)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - msg.sender.send(destAmount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call contains '.send(' keyword..
        Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - dest.transfer(msg.sender,destAmount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - src.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),srcAmount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - dest.transfer(msg.sender,destAmount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['src.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),srcAmount)', 'dest.transfer(msg.sender,destAmount)']
    Analyze External Address
        The variable 'src' in external call 'src.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),srcAmount)' has no state variable assigned in
        Dex.trade(uint256,ERC20,uint256,ERC20,uint256). Therefore we check whether it has been hardcoded in the function.
            No The variable 'src' is not hardcoded in the provided code snippet. It is used as a function parameter, which means its value is determined by whoever calls
            the 'trade' function. The user specifies the 'src' when they execute the function, and it is not given a fixed value within the code itself. Hence, 'src' is
            dynamic and dependent on runtime input rather than being predefined or hardcoded.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
