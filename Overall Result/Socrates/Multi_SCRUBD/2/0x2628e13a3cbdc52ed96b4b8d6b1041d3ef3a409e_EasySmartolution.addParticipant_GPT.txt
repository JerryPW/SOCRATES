Function Security Analysis for EasySmartolution.addParticipant(address,address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function addParticipant.
    Check direct function security
        - function EasySmartolution.addParticipant(address,address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The given code does not contain any require, if, or assert statements that compare msg.sender to an owner, leader, or similar authority address.
        - function EasySmartolution.addParticipant(address,address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not exhibit any of the required structures. It includes require statements, but none of them match the specified pattern involving changes
          to a particular variable from True/False and vice versa. It also does not include any 'if' statements that would throw, change a boolean, and possibly reset it,
          as described in the given rules.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['_referrer.send(msg.value/20)', 'processing.send(msg.value/20)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - _referrer.send(msg.value/20) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the '.send('
        keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - processing.send(msg.value/20) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the
        '.send(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: EasySmartolution.processPayment(address)
Function Security Analysis for EasySmartolution.processPayment(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function processPayment.
    Check direct function security
        - function EasySmartolution.processPayment(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not include any checks or assertions involving msg.sender. It neither checks the sender against an owner or leader nor uses msg.sender
          in a conditional statement that restricts function execution based on sender identity.
        - function EasySmartolution.processPayment(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any "require" statements or any if/throw logic related to the specified conditions. The structure does not match any of the
          listed patterns required: there is no require statement checking a boolean variable, and there is no modification of boolean variables like 'xxx = False' or
          'xxx = True' after a require statement.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['participant.processPayment.value(participant.daily())()']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - participant.processPayment.value(participant.daily())() ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['participant.processPayment.value(participant.daily())()']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['participants'] should be checked in variable participant
        Checked variables: participants
            No 1. The function 'addParticipant' and 'processPayment' are not constructors because their names do not match the contract name, 'EasySmartolution', nor are
            they explicitly named 'constructor'.  2. There is no hardcoding of the 'participants' state variable, as the code dynamically assigns values to
            'participants[_address]'.
            Function Security Analysis for EasySmartolution.addParticipant(address,address)
                There are no modifiers should be examined in function addParticipant.
                Check direct function security
                    - function EasySmartolution.addParticipant(address,address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                      Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures that evaluate the msg.sender against a specific role or address such as
                      Owner, Leader, CEO, or similar within a require, if, or assert statement.
                    - function EasySmartolution.addParticipant(address,address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                      Reason: The code does not contain any of the structure patterns that would satisfy the conditions set out (i.e. no require statement that is
                      immediately followed by a variable assignment to the opposite boolean value, or throw if the if condition fails pattern).
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
