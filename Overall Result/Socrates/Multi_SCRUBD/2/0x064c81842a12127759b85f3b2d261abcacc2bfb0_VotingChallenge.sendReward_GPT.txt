Function Security Analysis for VotingChallenge.sendReward(address)
    The modifier of function sendReward are ['afterVotingPeriod']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier afterVotingPeriod has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier checks a condition using the `require` statement to ensure `!isVotingPeriod`, but it does not restrict access by specific addresses nor
          does it indicate a lock mechanism. There is also no indication from the modifier name 'afterVotingPeriod' that it relates to address-based access control or
          reentrancy protection.
    Check direct function security
        - function VotingChallenge.sendReward(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: No statements in the code match any of the specified structures that involve checking if `msg.sender` is equal to or not equal to
          xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO. The code involves transferring rewards and performing operations based on winner and loser votes, but there are no conditional
          checks on `msg.sender`.
        - function VotingChallenge.sendReward(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not contain the specified patterns such as 'require(xxx == True); xxx = False' or the other patterns involving requirements and
          assignments of boolean values as described. The code is focused on handling monetary rewards and referrals in a smart contract context and does not involve the
          use of conditional assignments with opposite boolean values as described.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['forwarder.forward.value(sum)(referrer2,to)', 'forwarder.forward.value(sum)(referrer1,to)', 'to.transfer(reward+voters[to].fullVotes[winner])']
    Analyze Transfer
        - to.transfer(reward+voters[to].fullVotes[winner]) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        contains '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - forwarder.forward.value(sum)(referrer2,to) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - forwarder.forward.value(sum)(referrer1,to) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['forwarder.forward.value(sum)(referrer2,to)', 'forwarder.forward.value(sum)(referrer1,to)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['forwarder'] should be checked in variable forwarder
        Checked variables: forwarder
            Yes The function provided is a constructor because it is explicitly named 'constructor' and matches the characteristics of a typical constructor as it
            initializes state variables like 'forwarder', 'challengeDuration', and 'creator'.
        There are ['forwarder'] should be checked in variable forwarder
        Checked variables: forwarder
            Yes The function in the provided code is explicitly named 'constructor'.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
