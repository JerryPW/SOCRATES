            No The function 'setLPContract' is neither a constructor (as its name does not match the contract name 'BlackErc20' nor is it explicitly named 'constructor')
            nor does it hardcode the provided state variable 'lpContract' (since it assigns 'lpContract' based on the input parameter 'lp').
            Function Security Analysis for BlackErc20.setLPContract(address)
                The modifier of function setLPContract are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The modifier name 'onlyOwner' suggests that it enforces owner-only access, satisfying rule 3. However, the exact implementation of
                      _checkOwner(); is not provided, so the detailed enforcement structure is not visible in the code. Thus, my judgment is solely based on the
                      convention implied by the modifier's name.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
