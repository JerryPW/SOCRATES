        There are ['_ledgerExternalTokensAddresses'] should be checked in variable externalTokensForHolder
        Checked variables: _ledgerExternalTokensAddresses
            No The provided functions do not match any characteristics outlined;  1. The code doesn't have a function explicitly named 'constructor', nor does it have a
            function name matching the contract name 'Town', indicating that neither of these functions is a constructor.  2. The functions do not hardcode the 'state
            variable _ledgerExternalTokensAddresses'. It uses this variable in operations, but its usage is not hardcoding; it's used dynamically within loops and logical
            conditions without assigning a constant value to it.
