Function Security Analysis for RatScam.determinePID(RSdatasets.EventReturns)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function determinePID.
    Check direct function security
        - function RatScam.determinePID(RSdatasets.EventReturns) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any require, if, or assert statements that check if msg.sender is equal to xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO. There is no
          condition that restricts msg.sender to specific roles or addresses that match the provided characteristics.
        - function RatScam.determinePID(RSdatasets.EventReturns) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not satisfy any of the specified structures. It contains an 'if' condition to check if _pID is 0 and subsequently sets up player
          data, but none of the required structures involving require or throw statements are present.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

        Function Security Analysis for RatScam.buyXid(uint256)
            The modifier of function buyXid are ['isActivated', 'isHuman', 'isWithinLimits']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier isActivated has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier 'isActivated' does not enforce ownership or specific address execution permissions, nor does it use a lock mechanism to ensure
                  single entry access. It only checks if a condition 'activated_' is true. It doesn't match any characteristic for outputting 'Yes'.
                - modifier isHuman has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier uses the solidity global variable msg.sender to enforce a condition related to execution, ensuring only human users (not contracts)
                  can perform certain actions. However, it neither checks if the sender is an owner/specific address nor uses a lock mechanism as stipulated in the rules.
                - modifier isWithinLimits has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier 'isWithinLimits' does not involve any checks related to specific addresses or the owner fulfilling rule 1. It also doesn't
                  implement any locking mechanism or flag operations required for rule 2. The modifier name 'isWithinLimits' suggests a check on value boundaries rather
                  than owner restrictions or reentrancy protection, not satisfying rule 3.
            Check direct function security
                - function RatScam.buyXid(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any require, if, or assert statements to check if msg.sender matches a specified owner-like identifier.
                - function RatScam.buyXid(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures involving require statements or conditional throw statements followed by reassignments
                  of the same variable.
