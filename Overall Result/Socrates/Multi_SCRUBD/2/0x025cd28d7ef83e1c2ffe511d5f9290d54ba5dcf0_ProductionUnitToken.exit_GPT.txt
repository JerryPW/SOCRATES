Function Security Analysis for ProductionUnitToken.exit()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function exit.
    Check direct function security
        - function ProductionUnitToken.exit() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not have any condition checking if (msg.sender == xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO) or any of the specified structures mentioned such as
          require, if-else, or assert relating to msg.sender.
        - function ProductionUnitToken.exit() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function does not contain any 'require' statements or the specific statements in the if conditions as outlined in the provided structures.
External Call Analysis

Start analyze function: ProductionUnitToken.withdraw()
Function Security Analysis for ProductionUnitToken.withdraw()
    The modifier of function withdraw are ['onlyStronghands']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier onlyStronghands has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier doesn't check the sender's address for ownership or specific roles, nor does it manage a lock or use a naming pattern like Onlyxxx or
          nonReentrant indicating special access control.
    Check direct function security
        - function ProductionUnitToken.withdraw() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not include require, if, or assert statements that check whether msg.sender matches a specific owner, address, or role. The modifier
          'onlyStronghands' could implement such a check, but it's not visible in the provided code.
        - function ProductionUnitToken.withdraw() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function with the given code structure does not contain any of the specified patterns with require or if statements involving toggling of a boolean
          value.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['_customerAddress.transfer(_dividends)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - _customerAddress.transfer(_dividends) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the
        '.transfer(' keyword, satisfying the characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: ProductionUnitToken.sell(uint256)
Function Security Analysis for ProductionUnitToken.sell(uint256)
    The modifier of function sell are ['onlyBagholders']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier onlyBagholders has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier 'onlyBagholders' does not match any characteristics, as it checks for token balance rather than owner or specific address or using a lock
          operation.
    Check direct function security
        - function ProductionUnitToken.sell(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures involving msg.sender and xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
        - function ProductionUnitToken.sell(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified patterns. It uses 'require' statements with specific conditions but none matching those listed. No
          variable changes from 'True' to 'False' or vice versa in the given structures around a 'require'.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['moonIncContract.handleProductionDecrease.value(_dividends)(_customerAddress,_tokens*cookieProductionMultiplier)']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - moonIncContract.handleProductionDecrease.value(_dividends)(_customerAddress,_tokens*cookieProductionMultiplier) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['moonIncContract.handleProductionDecrease.value(_dividends)(_customerAddress,_tokens*cookieProductionMultiplier)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['moonIncContract'] should be checked in variable moonIncContract
        Checked variables: moonIncContract
            Yes The function is named 'ProductionUnitToken', which matches the contract name 'ProductionUnitToken'. This makes it the constructor of the contract in the
            context of older Solidity versions before the introduction of the 'constructor' keyword, thus satisfying the first characteristic.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
