    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _transferFrom.
    Check direct function security
        - function SAFX._transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code has 'require(tradingLive || sender == owner, "Trading not live")', but it does not check 'msg.sender'. Instead, it checks 'sender'. The
          condition required is specific to 'msg.sender'.
        - function SAFX._transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function contains a require statement, but it does not follow any of the specified structures. The structures require certain conditions to be
          checked against variables and have specific manipulations of those variables after the condition, which are not present in this code.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transferFrom', 'transfer']
        Function Security Analysis for SAFX.transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transferFrom.
            Check direct function security
                - function SAFX.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not check or restrict the caller (msg.sender) to a specific owner or address role like Owner, Address, Leader or CEO. It only
                  deals with allowances and balances.
                - function SAFX.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not explicitly meet any of the specified structures. It uses 'require' for a condition, but it does not change the state of a
                  variable as indicated by the patterns provided in the prompt.

Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: SAFX._sellTaxedTokens()
Function Security Analysis for SAFX._sellTaxedTokens()
    The modifier of function _sellTaxedTokens are ['swapping']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier swapping is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The 'swapping' modifier includes both the lock (_swapping = true) and unlock (_swapping = false) operations, indicating that it satisfies the condition
          for lock operation enforcement, ensuring the function enters only once.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
