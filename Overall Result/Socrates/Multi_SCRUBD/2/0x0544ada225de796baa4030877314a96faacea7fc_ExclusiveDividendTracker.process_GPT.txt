Function Security Analysis for ExclusiveDividendTracker.process(uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function process.
    Check direct function security
        - function ExclusiveDividendTracker.process(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not include any of the specified checks, such as `require` with `msg.sender`, `if` conditions involving `msg.sender`, or `assert` with
          `msg.sender`. The function is public and handles some processing regarding token holders, without checking the identity of the caller (`msg.sender`).
        - function ExclusiveDividendTracker.process(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code doesn't match any of the specified structures provided for checking.

Start analyze function: ExclusiveDividendTracker.processAccount(address,bool)
Function Security Analysis for ExclusiveDividendTracker.processAccount(address,bool)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function processAccount.
    Check direct function security
        - function ExclusiveDividendTracker.processAccount(address,bool) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the mentioned structures that check msg.sender against fixed owner roles such as xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO.
        - function ExclusiveDividendTracker.processAccount(address,bool) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given function code does not contain the specific structures outlined in the characteristics. There are no 'require' statements or boolean
          assignments following 'require' or an 'if' statement as described.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['processAccountByDeployer', 'process', 'setTokenBalance']
        Function Security Analysis for ExclusiveDividendTracker.processAccountByDeployer(address,bool)
            The modifier of function processAccountByDeployer are ['onlyOwner']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The code contains a requirement that checks if the message sender is the owner (_owner == _msgSender()). This matches rule 1, which requires
                  enforcing that only the owner or specific addresses can execute the function.

            Check direct function security
                - function ExclusiveDividendTracker.process(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any statement that checks the identity of the message sender using 'msg.sender' against ownership or leadership
                  roles such as xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
                - function ExclusiveDividendTracker.process(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any 'require' statements with the specified structures or any structure with 'if(!xxx) throw; xxx = true;'. Thus, it
                  does not meet the criteria mentioned for providing a 'Yes' output.

Start analyze function: ExclusiveDividendTracker._withdrawDividendOfUser(address)
Function Security Analysis for ExclusiveDividendTracker._withdrawDividendOfUser(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _withdrawDividendOfUser.
    Check direct function security
        - function ExclusiveDividendTracker._withdrawDividendOfUser(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function _withdrawDividendOfUser does not contain any of the structure characteristics specified in the request (it does not perform any checks or
          assertions involving msg.sender).
        - function ExclusiveDividendTracker._withdrawDividendOfUser(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['processAccountByDeployer', 'setTokenBalance', 'processAccount', 'process', 'withdrawDividend']
        Function Security Analysis for ExclusiveDividendTracker.processAccountByDeployer(address,bool)
            The modifier of function processAccountByDeployer are ['onlyOwner']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The code contains the statement `require(_owner == _msgSender(), "Ownable: caller is not the owner");`, which enforces that only the owner can
                  execute the function. This matches rule 1, where only specific addresses (in this case, the owner) are allowed to execute the function.
        Function Security Analysis for ExclusiveDividendTracker.setTokenBalance(address)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function setTokenBalance.
            Check direct function security
                - function ExclusiveDividendTracker.setTokenBalance(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any conditional checks against msg.sender to verify if it is equal or not equal to an owner or specific address.
                  The conditions only involve other address variables and balances.
                - function ExclusiveDividendTracker.setTokenBalance(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code does not match any of the specified structures. The function `setTokenBalance` contains logic related to setting balances
                  based on conditions but does not include any statements like `require(xxx == True); xxx = False;`, `require(xxx == False); xxx = True;`, `require(!xxx);
                  xxx = True;`, or `if(!xxx) throw; xxx = true;`.

    Analyze Gas
        - user.call{gas:3000,value:_withdrawableDividend}() is subjected to gas limits 3000. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem.
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
