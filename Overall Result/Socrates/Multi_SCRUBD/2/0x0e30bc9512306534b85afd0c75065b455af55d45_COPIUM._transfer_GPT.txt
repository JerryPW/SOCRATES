    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _transfer.
    Check direct function security
        - function COPIUM._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not check for msg.sender conditions against specific roles like xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO as required in the specified
          patterns, it instead generally checks roles against from, to addresses, and other roles in the system.
        - function COPIUM._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not show any matching structures as described. It involves checks and assignments related to various conditions but does not follow any of
          the four specific patterns where the same variable is toggled between True and False or vice versa after a require statement or an exception is thrown based on
          its value.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transferFrom', 'transfer']
        Function Security Analysis for COPIUM.transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transferFrom.
            Check direct function security
                - function COPIUM.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any checks on msg.sender involving comparison to any xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO variables.
                - function COPIUM.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The function does not contain any 'require' or 'if' statements as specified, nor does it appropriately handle the assignment changes to a
                  variable 'xxx == True' or 'xxx == False'. Therefore, it does not match any of the given structures.

Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: COPIUM.swapAndLiquify()
Function Security Analysis for COPIUM.swapAndLiquify()
    The modifier of function swapAndLiquify are ['lockTheSwap']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier lockTheSwap is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The modifier `lockTheSwap` contains both the lock and unlock operations for `inSwapAndLiquify`. It sets `inSwapAndLiquify` to true before the function
          runs and resets it to false afterward. This matches the condition of ensuring a function enters only once by using a lock operation.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
