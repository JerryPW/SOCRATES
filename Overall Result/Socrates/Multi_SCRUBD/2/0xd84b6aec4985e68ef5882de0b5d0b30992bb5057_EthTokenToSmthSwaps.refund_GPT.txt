Function Security Analysis for EthTokenToSmthSwaps.refund(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function refund.
    Check direct function security
        - function EthTokenToSmthSwaps.refund(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any checks involving msg.sender compared to a specific owner or authorized entity as per the defined patterns like xxxOwner,
          xxxAddress, Leader, CEO, etc.
        - function EthTokenToSmthSwaps.refund(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function does not contain a series of checks and changes to a single boolean variable that meet the given structures. It includes two 'require'
          statements, but neither of them handles a boolean variable or directly alters its state as per the described patterns.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['ERC20(swap.token).transfer(msg.sender,swap.balance)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - ERC20(swap.token).transfer(msg.sender,swap.balance) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - ERC20(swap.token).transfer(msg.sender,swap.balance) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['ERC20(swap.token).transfer(msg.sender,swap.balance)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['swaps'] should be checked in variable swap
        Checked variables: swaps
            No The function code provided includes functions like createSwap, createSwapTarget, withdraw, etc. None of these functions match the contract name
            'EthTokenToSmthSwaps', nor is any function explicitly named 'constructor'. Additionally, none of the functions in the provided code have hardcoded state
            variables; they define variables within their logic without hardcoding state or its modification. Therefore, the code does not satisfy any of the specified
            characteristics.
            Function Security Analysis for EthTokenToSmthSwaps.createSwap(bytes20,address,uint256,address)
                There are no modifiers should be examined in function createSwap.
                Check direct function security
                    - function EthTokenToSmthSwaps.createSwap(bytes20,address,uint256,address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                      Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures that check if msg.sender is equal to a specific owner/address/role or not equal to
                      it.
                    - function EthTokenToSmthSwaps.createSwap(bytes20,address,uint256,address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                      Reason: The function does not contain any of the required structures like checking a boolean variable with require or if and changing its state
                      thereafter. It mostly performs require checks for validation and transfers tokens, which don't match the required patterns.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
