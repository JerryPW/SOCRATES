Start analyze function: CoinMerge._disperseEth()
Function Security Analysis for CoinMerge._disperseEth()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _disperseEth.
    Check direct function security
        - function CoinMerge._disperseEth() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function _disperseEth does not include any require or assert statements, or conditional checks on msg.sender that match the specified patterns of
          checking against xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
        - function CoinMerge._disperseEth() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the required structures such as require(xxx == True), xxx = False or if(!xxx) throw, xxx = true, etc. There are no
          conditional checks or logical negations that directly lead to variable assignments as specified.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transfer', 'transferFrom', '_tax', '_transfer']
        Function Security Analysis for CoinMerge.transfer(address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transfer.
            Check direct function security
                - function CoinMerge.transfer(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not include any direct ownership checks or conditions involving msg.sender against an owner or similar role.
                - function CoinMerge.transfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The function does not include any require or if statement related to a variable, nor does it involve toggling a boolean variable between true
                  and false around a require statement or conditional throw. Thus, none of the specified structures are present.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['External.deposit(_devBalance)', 'm_ProjectWallet.transfer(_projectBalance)', 'address(address(External)).transfer(_devBalance)',
    'address(address(EthReflect)).transfer(_redistBalance)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - m_ProjectWallet.transfer(_projectBalance) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        'm_ProjectWallet.transfer(_projectBalance)' contains the '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - address(address(External)).transfer(_devBalance) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        'address(address(External)).transfer(_devBalance)' contains the '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - address(address(EthReflect)).transfer(_redistBalance) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external
        call 'address(address(EthReflect)).transfer(_redistBalance)' contains the '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - External.deposit(_devBalance) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['External.deposit(_devBalance)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['External'] should be checked in variable External
        Checked variables: External
            Yes The provided code snippet demonstrates a constructor function. It is explicitly named 'constructor', which satisfies the first characteristic outlined.
            Constructors are special functions in Solidity that are automatically executed upon contract creation and typically serve to initialize the contract state.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
