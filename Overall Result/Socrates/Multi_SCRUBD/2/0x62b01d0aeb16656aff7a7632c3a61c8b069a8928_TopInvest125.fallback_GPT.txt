Start analyze function: TopInvest125.fallback()
Function Security Analysis for TopInvest125.fallback()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
    Check direct function security
        - function TopInvest125.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The given code does not contain any verification statements that check if 'msg.sender' is equal or not equal to a specific owner, address, Leader, or
          CEO. It only uses 'msg.sender' to add the current sender to a queue.
        - function TopInvest125.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code doesn't contain any of the specified patterns like require statements followed by changing the same variable value from True to False or
          vice versa as required in the provided conditions.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['PROMO.send(promo)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - PROMO.send(promo) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the '.send(' keyword,
        which matches the second specified condition.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: TopInvest125.pay()
Function Security Analysis for TopInvest125.pay()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function pay.
    Check direct function security
        - function TopInvest125.pay() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not check the identity of the caller using msg.sender, so it doesn't match any of the specified structures.
        - function TopInvest125.pay() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not contain any of the specified structures with a 'require' or 'if' statement followed by a variable assignment as described in the
          problem statement.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['fallback']
        Function Security Analysis for TopInvest125.fallback()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
            Check direct function security
                - function TopInvest125.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not include any checks specifically against 'msg.sender' being equal to or not equal to owners, addresses, or specific roles
                  like Leader or CEO as required by the listed patterns.
                - function TopInvest125.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The given code does not satisfy any of the specified structures. There are no 'require' statements followed by changes in a boolean variable
                  that match the described patterns.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['dep.depositor.send(dep.expect)', 'dep.depositor.send(money)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - dep.depositor.send(dep.expect) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains '.send('
        keyword, so it satisfies the characteristics.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - dep.depositor.send(money) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains '.send('
        keyword, so it satisfies the characteristics.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
