        Function Security Analysis for ExclusiveDividendTracker.processAccountByDeployer(address,bool)
            The modifier of function processAccountByDeployer are ['onlyOwner']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The code in the modifier uses 'require(_owner == _msgSender(), "Ownable: caller is not the owner")' to ensure that only the owner can call the
                  function. This matches the first rule, as it enforces that only a specific address (the owner) can execute the function, using the 'require' statement.
                  There is no code related to a lock operation in this modifier, so the second characteristic does not apply.

            Check direct function security
                - function ExclusiveDividendTracker.setTokenBalance(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain any authorization checks based on the msg.sender, which would include checks against 'xxxOwner', 'xxxAddress',
                  'Leader', or 'CEO'.
                - function ExclusiveDividendTracker.setTokenBalance(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code provided does not include statements such as 'require(xxx == True)' or 'require(xxx == False)' or 'require(!xxx)'. It does not have
                  'xxx = False;' or 'xxx = True;' with 'require' related structure or 'if(!xxx) throw;' structure in the same context as described. Hence, it does not
                  satisfy any of the given structures.
