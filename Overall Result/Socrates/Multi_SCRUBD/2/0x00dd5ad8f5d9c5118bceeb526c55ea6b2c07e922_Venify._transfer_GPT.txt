Function Security Analysis for Venify._transfer(address,address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _transfer.
    Check direct function security
        - function Venify._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: There is no use of the msg.sender variable within the function to enforce ownership or authority checks.
        - function Venify._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code snippet contains `inSwapAndLiquify = true;` and `inSwapAndLiquify = false;`, but it lacks a preceding `require(inSwapAndLiquify == False)` or
          equivalent requirement. Therefore, none of the specified code structures that mandate these requirements are present.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transferFrom', 'transfer']
        Function Security Analysis for Venify.transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transferFrom.
            Check direct function security
                - function Venify.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not have any access control checks related to msg.sender being equal to an owner or a specified address/role (e.g., Owner,
                  Address, Leader, or CEO).
                - function Venify.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code does not contain any require statements or if-throw patterns that match the specified structures (characteristics 1 to 4).

Start analyze function: Venify.swapTokensForETH(uint256)
Function Security Analysis for Venify.swapTokensForETH(uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function swapTokensForETH.
    Check direct function security
        - function Venify.swapTokensForETH(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function 'swapTokensForETH' does not contain any of the specified structures related to checking 'msg.sender' against an owner or similar addresses.
        - function Venify.swapTokensForETH(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any require statements or any other structures that match the specified characteristics under 1, 2, 3 or 4. It only
          contains function calls and assignments without any conditions or "require" statements.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transferFrom', '_transfer', 'transfer']
        Function Security Analysis for Venify.transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transferFrom.
            Check direct function security
                - function Venify.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not have any requirement or condition directly checking if msg.sender is a specific owner, address, or role (like Leader or CEO).
                - function Venify.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The function does not contain require or if statements that match the specified criteria.

    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - uniswapV2Router.swapExactTokensForETHSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens(tokenAmount,0,path,address(this),block.timestamp) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['uniswapV2Router.swapExactTokensForETHSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens(tokenAmount,0,path,address(this),block.timestamp)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['uniswapV2Router'] should be checked in variable uniswapV2Router
        Checked variables: uniswapV2Router
            Yes The function provided is named 'constructor', which clearly indicates that this is the constructor of the contract. Constructors are special functions in
            Solidity that are executed once when the contract is deployed and used to set initial values of state variables or perform other setup tasks. Therefore, the
            external call satisfies the first characteristic of being a constructor.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: Venify.sendETH(address,uint256)
Function Security Analysis for Venify.sendETH(address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function sendETH.
    Check direct function security
        - function Venify.sendETH(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any checks involving msg.sender against an 'Owner' or 'Leader' role.
        - function Venify.sendETH(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures with a boolean variable being set to True or False based on a condition evaluated with
          'require' or similar structures.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transferFrom', '_transfer', 'transfer']
        Function Security Analysis for Venify.transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transferFrom.
            Check direct function security
                - function Venify.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not have any access control checks related to msg.sender, such as require, if, or assert with msg.sender compared to
                  xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
                - function Venify.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code doesn't contain any structure that matches the specified patterns involving condition checks and assignments of variables.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['recipient.call{value:amount}()']

        - recipient.call{value:amount}() ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['recipient.call{value:amount}()']
    Analyze External Address
        The variable 'recipient' in external call 'recipient.call{value:amount}()' has no state variable assigned in Venify.sendETH(address,uint256). Considering that it
        is an internal/private function, we analyze the function inputs.
        Analyze External Address
            There are ['buyBackWallet'] should be checked in variable buyBackWallet
            Checked variables: buyBackWallet
                State variable buyBackWallet has initialized in public area after declaration.
