Function Security Analysis for BensRevival.distributeDividend(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function distributeDividend.
    Check direct function security
        - function BensRevival.distributeDividend(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures that check msg.sender against a specific owner, address, leader, or CEO.
        - function BensRevival.distributeDividend(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not have any of the specified structures. There are no require or if statements that check for either variable directly with the required
          boolean expressions, such as require(xxx == True), require(xxx == False), require(!xxx), or if(!xxx) throw, followed by an assignment to change the boolean
          status of the same variable.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['claimTokens', 'setShare', 'process']
        Function Security Analysis for BensRevival.claimTokens(address)
            The modifier of function claimTokens are ['onlyToken']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyToken is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: Upon re-evaluation, the onlyToken modifier contains the statement require(msg.sender == _token); which matches characteristic 1, as it enforces
                  that only the address stored in _token can execute the function. There are no additional structures or conditions present, specifically no lock
                  operation structure related to rule 2. Therefore, the function satisfies rule 1.
        Function Security Analysis for BensRevival.setShare(address,uint256)
            The modifier of function setShare are ['onlyToken']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyToken is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: Upon re-evaluating, the modifier uses 'require(msg.sender == _token);' which enforces that only a specific address (_token) can execute the
                  function, satisfying rule 1. The code does not present a locking mechanism required for rule 2.
        Function Security Analysis for BensRevival.process(uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function process.
            Check direct function security
                - function BensRevival.process(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain any condition that restricts its execution to a specific address such as xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO. It only
                  performs operations based on gas availability and shareholder count.
                - function BensRevival.process(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The given code does not have any 'require' or 'if(!xxx) throw' statements manipulating a boolean variable as described in the structures. Thus,
                  it does not match any of the specified structures.
External Call Analysis

    Analyze Transfer
        - IERC20(REVIVAL).transfer(shareholder,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - IERC20(REVIVAL).transfer(shareholder,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['IERC20(REVIVAL).transfer(shareholder,amount)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['REVIVAL'] should be checked in variable REVIVAL
        Checked variables: REVIVAL
            Yes The provided code is a constructor for the contract named BensRevival. This is evident as the function is explicitly named 'constructor'. Additionally,
            within this constructor, there is a state variable 'REVIVAL' which is hardcoded to a specific address '0xa3e54198998D800703399f3BfA38bE4E14045036'. Both these
            points satisfy the given conditions.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
