    Check direct function security
        - function ZTCrowdsale.refund() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code inside the function does not contain any of the required structures that directly involve checking msg.sender against an
          xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
        - function ZTCrowdsale.refund() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not match any of the specified structures for the following reasons:  1. While there is a require statement (`require(raised <
          minAmount);`), it does not check for a boolean variable (xxx) against True or False, nor does it switch the value of that variable immediately afterwards.  2.
          There is no "require(!xxx);" structure or changing boolean logic associated with the require statement.  3. Similarly, there is no "if(!xxx) throw;" structure
          followed by changing the boolean state of "xxx".  Thus, none of the described patterns are matched in the code.
