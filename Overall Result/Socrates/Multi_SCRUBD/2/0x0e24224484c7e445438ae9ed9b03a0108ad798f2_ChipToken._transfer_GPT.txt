    Check direct function security
        - function ChipToken._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The provided code does not include any checks involving the comparison of msg.sender with any specific role like owner or an address, as described in
          the criteria. It primarily checks other conditions related to transaction limits, blacklists, cooldowns, and fees.
        - function ChipToken._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code contains the statement `require(!blacklist[from] && !blacklist[to], "sender or recipient is blacklisted!");` which is equivalent to
          `require(!xxx)` in logic, where `xxx` is the condition checking if `from` or `to` is not blacklisted. Then, the function implementation continues but doesn't
          strictly follow up `xxx = true` or reset any user status, so the specific pattern of setting `xxx = True` after the require is not necessarily present.
          Additionally, the function does not satisfy scenario 2 or 4 structures either. Therefore, despite containing the condition for `require(!xxx)`, it lacks the
          subsequent 'xxx = True' assignment and can be a bit misleading since the condition itself matches one part of scenario 3 but not completely.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

        Function Security Analysis for ChipToken.transfer(address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transfer.
            Check direct function security
                - function ChipToken.transfer(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified characteristics related to checking the identity of the message sender against a specific
                  owner or leader role.
                - function ChipToken.transfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any 'require' statement or conditional checks like 'if(!xxx) throw'. It only includes a function call followed by a
                  return statement.

Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: ChipToken.swap()
Function Security Analysis for ChipToken.swap()
    The modifier of function swap are ['lockTheSwap']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier lockTheSwap is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: Upon reviewing the code, both the lock operation (setting 'inSwap' to true) and the unlock operation (resetting 'inSwap' to false) are present,
          confirming the use of a lock mechanism. This satisfies the second characteristic.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
