    Check direct function security
        - function EthTokenToSmthSwaps.createSwap(bytes20,address,uint256,address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures involving msg.sender with xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
        - function EthTokenToSmthSwaps.createSwap(bytes20,address,uint256,address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the structures described. It includes several 'require' statements but they don't follow the specified patterns where
          the same variable must be set to True/False after a require check or if check is thrown.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['ERC20(_token).transferFrom(msg.sender,this,_value)']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - ERC20(_token).transferFrom(msg.sender,this,_value) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['ERC20(_token).transferFrom(msg.sender,this,_value)']
    Analyze External Address
        The variable '_token' in external call 'ERC20(_token).transferFrom(msg.sender,this,_value)' has no state variable assigned in
        EthTokenToSmthSwaps.createSwap(bytes20,address,uint256,address). Therefore we check whether it has been hardcoded in the function.
            No The variable `_token` is provided as a parameter to the function `createSwap` and is used to initiate a transfer via the `ERC20` transferFrom function.
            Since `_token` is not assigned a fixed value or directly manipulated within the function body, it is not hardcoded. It is dynamically specified at the time of
            calling the function.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
