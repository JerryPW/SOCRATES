Function Security Analysis for DividendDistributor.distributeDividend(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function distributeDividend.
    Check direct function security
        - function DividendDistributor.distributeDividend(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any structure that checks msg.sender against an owner, address, leader, or CEO variable.
        - function DividendDistributor.distributeDividend(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not have a `require` statement or a `throw` statement (exception handling) related to making the desired assertions on a boolean variable.
          Instead, it has a guard clause using `if`, but it doesn't satisfy the specific patterns described, as it doesn't modify the state of a boolean variable
          accordingly.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['setShare', 'process', 'claimDividend']
        Function Security Analysis for DividendDistributor.setShare(address,uint256)
            The modifier of function setShare are ['onlyToken']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyToken is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The code structure 'require(msg.sender == _token)' enforces that only a specific address can execute the function, satisfying characteristic 1.
                  The modifier ensures the function can only be executed by the address stored in '_token'. There is no indication of a lock operation, so characteristic
                  2 does not apply. The conclusion remains the same based on characteristic 1.
        Function Security Analysis for DividendDistributor.process(uint256)
            The modifier of function process are ['onlyToken']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyToken is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The code uses 'require(msg.sender == _token)', which fulfills characteristic 1 of enforcing that only specific addresses (here '_token') can
                  execute the function. There are no structural omissions based on characteristic 1 as no lock operations are involved, and the code fits the described
                  patterns of checking the specific sender's address.
        Function Security Analysis for DividendDistributor.claimDividend()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function claimDividend.
            Check direct function security
                - function DividendDistributor.claimDividend() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code snippet does not contain any of the specified structures that check the msg.sender against an xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
                - function DividendDistributor.claimDividend() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided function `claimDividend` does not contain any of the specified structures. It simply calls the `distributeDividend` function with
                  `msg.sender` as an argument.

        - RWRD.transfer(shareholder,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - RWRD.transfer(shareholder,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['RWRD.transfer(shareholder,amount)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['RWRD'] should be checked in variable RWRD
        Checked variables: RWRD
            State variable RWRD has initialized in public area after declaration.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
