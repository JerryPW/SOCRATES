Function Security Analysis for WashCrowdsale.fallback()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
    Check direct function security
        - function WashCrowdsale.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not check if the msg.sender is equal to a specific owner, address, leader, or CEO, nor does it throw or assert based on msg.sender
          conditions.
        - function WashCrowdsale.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon review, the code only contains the first part of a matching pattern structure, `require(!crowdsaleClosed);`. However, it does not include the
          second required statement `crowdsaleClosed = True;`. Therefore, it does not fully match any of the defined structures as both statements are needed for a match.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['beneficiary.send(ethamount)', 'tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,amount)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - beneficiary.send(ethamount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains '.send('
        keyword, which matches the second characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,amount)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['tokenReward'] should be checked in variable tokenReward
        Checked variables: tokenReward
            Yes The function name 'WashCrowdsale' matches the contract name 'WashCrowdsale', indicating that this is a constructor function. Additionally, the state
            variable 'tokenReward' is hardcoded with the address '0x5b8c5c4835b2B5dAEF18079389FDaEfE9f7a6063' inside the constructor function, which fulfills the second
            characteristic as well.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
