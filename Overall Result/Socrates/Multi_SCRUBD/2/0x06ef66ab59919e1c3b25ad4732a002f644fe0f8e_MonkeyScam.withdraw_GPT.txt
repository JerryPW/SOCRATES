Function Security Analysis for MonkeyScam.withdraw()
    The modifier of function withdraw are ['isActivated', 'isHuman']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier isActivated has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier `isActivated` checks a condition unrelated to address ownership or lock mechanism. It verifies whether a certain state (`activated_`) is
          true. This condition doesn't enforce ownership restrictions or ensure the function runs only once.
        - modifier isHuman has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier 'isHuman' checks and ensures that the sender is a non-smart contract address by verifying that the code size associated with the address is
          zero. This is unrelated to ownership or lock mechanisms based on the provided characteristics.
    Check direct function security
        - function MonkeyScam.withdraw() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not have any statements checking authority conditions involving msg.sender with Owners, Leaders, CEOs or similar roles.
        - function MonkeyScam.withdraw() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code doesn't contain any of the specified structures involving 'require' statements or if conditions with variable checks that change their truth
          value subsequently. It does check for 'round_.ended == false' but doesn't match the specific patterns given.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['plyr_[_pID].addr.transfer(_eth)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - plyr_[_pID].addr.transfer(_eth) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the
        '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: MonkeyScam.endRound(LDdatasets.EventReturns)
Function Security Analysis for MonkeyScam.endRound(LDdatasets.EventReturns)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function endRound.
    Check direct function security
        - function MonkeyScam.endRound(LDdatasets.EventReturns) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function 'endRound' does not contain any of the specified structures related to 'msg.sender'. There are no require, if, or assert statements
          comparing 'msg.sender' to any owner or address in the provided code.
        - function MonkeyScam.endRound(LDdatasets.EventReturns) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified patterns. The closest condition is checking if
          (!address(MonkeyKingCorp).call.value(_com)(bytes4(keccak256("deposit()")))), but it does not strictly follow the structures outlined as it does not set a
          variable to true or false after the check.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['reLoadXname', 'buyCore', 'reLoadCore', 'buyXid', 'reLoadXaddr', 'withdraw', 'fallback', 'reLoadXid', 'buyXaddr', 'buyXname']
        Function Security Analysis for MonkeyScam.reLoadXname(bytes32,uint256)
            The modifier of function reLoadXname are ['isActivated', 'isHuman', 'isWithinLimits']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier isActivated has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier checks for a condition related to activation status, not ownership or reentrancy. It does not satisfy any of the three specified
                  characteristics.
                - modifier isHuman has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: None of the rules specified are matched. The code checks if the sender is a human by ensuring that the address is not a smart contract address,
                  but doesn't enforce any ownership or locking mechanism.
                - modifier isWithinLimits has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier 'isWithinLimits' does not enforce owner or specific address restrictions (criterion 1) or use a lock operation (criterion 2). It
                  checks whether a given Ethereum amount is within specified limits, which does not match any of the criteria. Additionally, the modifier's name does not
                  imply restrictions based on ownership or reentrancy (criterion 3).
            Check direct function security
                - function MonkeyScam.reLoadXname(bytes32,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures that involve checking caller authorization based on the msg.sender against an
                  Owner/Leader/CEO address.
                - function MonkeyScam.reLoadXname(bytes32,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The given code snippet does not contain any of the required structures with variable assignment and conditions as specified. The structures
                  involve conditional checks specifically with 'require' or 'if' for a boolean variable, followed by an assignment that changes the boolean state of the
                  variable, and potentially another assignment that changes it back. The code does not fulfill such requirements.
External Call Analysis

    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - address(MonkeyKingCorp).call.value(_com)(bytes4(keccak256()(deposit()))) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['address(MonkeyKingCorp).call.value(_com)(bytes4(keccak256()(deposit())))']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['MonkeyKingCorp'] should be checked in variable MonkeyKingCorp

            State variable MonkeyKingCorp has initialized in public area after declaration.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
