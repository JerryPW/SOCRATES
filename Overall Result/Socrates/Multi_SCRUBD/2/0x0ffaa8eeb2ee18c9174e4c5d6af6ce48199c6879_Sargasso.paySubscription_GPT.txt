    Check direct function security
        - function Sargasso.paySubscription() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any check that compares msg.sender to an owner or specific leadership address using the specified patterns.
        - function Sargasso.paySubscription() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does contain the structure `{require(xxx == False); xxx = True; ...}` as it checks `require(secondaryUserLock[msg.sender] == false);` and then
          sets `secondaryUserLock[msg.sender] = true;`. However, immediately after setting the variable to true, it executes `buccTransfer = BuccV2(v2Address);`, which is
          part of the main logic of the function, meaning the negation operation is immediately followed by main logic operation. Thus, it doesn't meet the requirement
          that the state negation should immediately follow the state check and be completed before any of the main logic of the function.

    Analyze Gas
        - buccTransfer.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),subscriptionFee) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['buccTransfer.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),subscriptionFee)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['v2Address'] should be checked in variable buccTransfer
        Checked variables: v2Address
            Yes The provided code includes a constructor function, as indicated by the function definition 'constructor(...) public'. The constructor sets the state
            variable 'v2Address' using a parameter '_v2Address', which is not hardcoded. Since the function is a constructor, the first characteristic is satisfied.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
