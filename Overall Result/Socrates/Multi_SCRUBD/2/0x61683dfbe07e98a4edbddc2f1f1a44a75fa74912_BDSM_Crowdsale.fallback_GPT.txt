Function Security Analysis for BDSM_Crowdsale.fallback()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
    Check direct function security
        - function BDSM_Crowdsale.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function provided does not contain any checks related to msg.sender that match the specified patterns for owner, address, leader, or CEO checks.
        - function BDSM_Crowdsale.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not immediately perform the state negation operation on 'tokensWithdrawn' after checking its state. The state change to 'tokensWithdrawn =
          true;' occurs after executing some transfer actions and is not immediate before the main logic processes. Thus, it does not satisfy the structural requirements.

    Analyze Transfer
        - sharesTokenAddress.transfer(msg.sender,tokenFree) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - msg.sender.transfer(msg.value-sendETH) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call contains
        '.transfer(' keyword, which matches the first characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - owner.transfer(actualETHTransfer) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call contains '.transfer('
        keyword, which matches the first characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.

        - sharesTokenAddress.transfer(safeContract,sharesTokenAddress.balanceOf(this)) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - sharesTokenAddress.balanceOf(this) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - sharesTokenAddress.transfer(msg.sender,tokenFree) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - sharesTokenAddress.transfer(msg.sender,tokenToBuy) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - sharesTokenAddress.transfer(safeContract,sharesTokenAddress.balanceOf(this)) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['sharesTokenAddress.balanceOf(this)', 'sharesTokenAddress.transfer(msg.sender,tokenFree)',
    'sharesTokenAddress.transfer(msg.sender,tokenToBuy)', 'sharesTokenAddress.transfer(safeContract,sharesTokenAddress.balanceOf(this))']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['sharesTokenAddress'] should be checked in variable sharesTokenAddress
        Checked variables: sharesTokenAddress
            Yes The function name 'BDSM_Crowdsale' matches the contract name 'BDSM_Crowdsale', indicating that it is a constructor.
        There are ['sharesTokenAddress'] should be checked in variable sharesTokenAddress
        Checked variables: sharesTokenAddress
            Yes 1. The function name 'BDSM_Crowdsale' matches the contract name 'BDSM_Crowdsale', indicating that this function is a constructor. 2. The state variable
            'sharesTokenAddress' is assigned the value 'token(_tokenAddress)', which is not hardcoded. Therefore, the function does not hardcode the provided state
            variable. Overall, since the function satisfies the constructor criteria, the answer is 'Yes'.
        There are ['sharesTokenAddress'] should be checked in variable sharesTokenAddress
        Checked variables: sharesTokenAddress
            Yes The function 'BDSM_Crowdsale' is a constructor because its name matches the name of the contract 'BDSM_Crowdsale'.
        There are ['sharesTokenAddress'] should be checked in variable sharesTokenAddress
        Checked variables: sharesTokenAddress
            Yes The function provided is indeed a constructor function, as the function name 'BDSM_Crowdsale' matches the contract name 'BDSM_Crowdsale'. Constructor
            functions are executed once when a contract is created, setting the initial state of the contract. Although the constructor does set the 'sharesTokenAddress',
            it is not hardcoded but passed as a parameter '_tokenAddress', thus only the first characteristic is met.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
