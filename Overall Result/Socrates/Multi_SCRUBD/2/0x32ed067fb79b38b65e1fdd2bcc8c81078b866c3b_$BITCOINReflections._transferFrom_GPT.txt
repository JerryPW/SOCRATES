    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _transferFrom.
    Check direct function security
        - function $BITCOINReflections._transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the required structures that check if msg.sender is or isn't a specific address like xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or
          CEO. It checks for conditions like transaction limit exemptions, balance checks, and dividend exemptions, but none of these involve a direct check on msg.sender
          involving the specified entities.
        - function $BITCOINReflections._transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not match any of the specified structures from 1 to 4. None of these specified logical conditions with assignments are present in
          this code.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transferFrom', 'transfer']

            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transferFrom.
            Check direct function security
                - function $BITCOINReflections.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The given code checks the allowance of the sender using `_allowances[sender][msg.sender] != _totalSupply` and decrements it if necessary. There
                  are no checks or conditions directly involving `msg.sender` equaling `xxxOwner`, `xxxAddress`, `Leader`, or `CEO`.
                - function $BITCOINReflections.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The given code does not have any of the required structures, such as a requirement or conditional check for a boolean variable followed by an
                  assignment. It only checks and updates _allowances without requiring certain boolean expressions.

    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - distributor.setShare(recipient,_balances[recipient]) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - distributor.process(distributorGas) is subjected to gas limits distributorGas <= 3000. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The
        function setDistributorSettings allows setting the distributorGas variable only if the provided gas value is strictly less than 750,000 (as per the require
        statement in line 2). Since any gas value assigned to distributorGas through this function must be less than 750,000, and the problem asks whether this value can
        exceed 3,000, the answer is no. Additionally, any other logic within the contract does not modify distributorGas beyond its initial assignment of 500,000, which
        is already lower than 750,000. Therefore, the requirement that distributorGas is less than 750,000 ensures that it is always lesser than 3,000 as well, granting
        that any set value, either default or through mutation, is less than 3,000. Therefore, the assignment to the variable distributorGas is always less than or equal
        to 3000 based on the contract's logical and guard conditions.
        - distributor.setShare(sender,_balances[sender]) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['distributor.setShare(recipient,_balances[recipient])', 'distributor.setShare(sender,_balances[sender])']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['distributor'] should be checked in variable distributor
        Checked variables: distributor
            Yes The code provided includes a 'constructor' function, which matches the characteristics for being a constructor by name. Additionally, within the
            constructor, the state variable 'distributor' is assigned a value using 'new DividendDistributor(_dexRouter);'. Therefore, both characteristics are satisfied.
        There are ['distributor'] should be checked in variable distributor
        Checked variables: distributor
            Yes The function in the provided code is a constructor, as indicated by the use of the 'constructor' keyword. Constructors are explicitly named 'constructor'
            in Solidity when not matching the contract name. This satisfies the first characteristic as it is a constructor of the contract.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: $BITCOINReflections.swapBack()
Function Security Analysis for $BITCOINReflections.swapBack()
    The modifier of function swapBack are ['swapping']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier swapping is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The modifier 'swapping' sets 'inSwap' to true before the function and resets it to false afterward. Both the lock and unlock operations are present,
          which satisfies characteristic 2.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

    There are no modifiers should be examined in function triggerAutoBuyback.
    Check direct function security
        - function $BITCOINReflections.triggerAutoBuyback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any checks related to msg.sender, such as conditions comparing msg.sender to an owner or address variable.
        - function $BITCOINReflections.triggerAutoBuyback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures (require with condition, if with throw) involving a variable toggle between true/false.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

Start analyze function: $BITCOINReflections.buyTokens(uint256,address)
Function Security Analysis for $BITCOINReflections.buyTokens(uint256,address)
    The modifier of function buyTokens are ['swapping']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier swapping is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The modifier 'swapping' contains both the lock operation by setting 'inSwap = true;' before the function runs and the unlock operation by setting
          'inSwap = false;' afterward. This corresponds to rule 2, confirming the function is designed to enter only once.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
