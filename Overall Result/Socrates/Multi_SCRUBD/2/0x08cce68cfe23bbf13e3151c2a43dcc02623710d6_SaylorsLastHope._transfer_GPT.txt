    Check direct function security
        - function SaylorsLastHope._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code contains a condition `if (msg.sender != pair ...)` which includes a comparison with `msg.sender`, but it does not compare `msg.sender` to
          xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
        - function SaylorsLastHope._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code checks for certain conditions related to trading status and bots by requiring that the 'tradingOpen' variable is true and using 'require'.
          However, it doesn't explicitly set the 'tradingOpen' variable to any value, nor does it manipulate a boolean with a name that matches the structures specified
          in the task.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transferFrom', 'transfer']
        Function Security Analysis for SaylorsLastHope.transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transferFrom.
            Check direct function security
                - function SaylorsLastHope.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not include any checks on msg.sender related to specific roles like xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO.
                - function SaylorsLastHope.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The given code does not use the 'require' function to check a condition nor does it have a throw mechanism like in the fourth structure.
                  Instead, it uses an 'if' condition to check the allowance and update it, using 'sub' as a method to decrease it, but this does not correspond to any of
                  the structures.

        There are ['moneyPrinter'] should be checked in variable moneyPrinter
        Checked variables: moneyPrinter
            Yes 1. The function provided is explicitly named 'constructor', which indicates that it is a constructor function. Thus, it satisfies the first
            characteristic.
        There are ['moneyPrinter'] should be checked in variable moneyPrinter
        Checked variables: moneyPrinter
            Yes The provided code snippet is a constructor function as it explicitly uses the keyword 'constructor'. Therefore, it satisfies the first characteristic of
            checking whether the provided code is a constructor.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: SaylorsLastHope.swapBack()
Function Security Analysis for SaylorsLastHope.swapBack()
    The modifier of function swapBack are ['lockTheSwap']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier lockTheSwap is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The modifier 'lockTheSwap' sets a lock flag 'inSwapAndLiquify' to true before the function code executes and resets it to false afterward. This ensures
          the function enters only once at a time, matching characteristic 2.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
