Function Security Analysis for HeroAuction.orderOnSaleAuction(uint256,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function orderOnSaleAuction.
    Check direct function security
        - function HeroAuction.orderOnSaleAuction(uint256,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: None of the listed characteristics that involve direct checks against msg.sender for ownership or specific address/role conditions are present in the
          given code.
        - function HeroAuction.orderOnSaleAuction(uint256,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures (1, 2, 3, or 4). It primarily checks conditions with 'require' but does not directly toggle a
          boolean variable from true/false or vice versa around a 'require' or 'if' condition involving !xxx (where xxx is a boolean variable).

    Analyze External Address
        There are ['saleAuction'] should be checked in variable saleAuction
        Checked variables: saleAuction
            No The function 'setSaleAuctionAddress' is not a constructor because it doesn't match the contract name 'HeroAuction' and is not explicitly named
            'constructor'. Furthermore, the state variable 'saleAuction' is not hardcoded within the function but instead is set by the function parameter '_address',
            indicating the 'saleAuction' address is provided dynamically and not hardcoded.
            Function Security Analysis for HeroAuction.setSaleAuctionAddress(address)
                The modifier of function setSaleAuctionAddress are ['onlyLeader']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyLeader is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The modifier 'onlyLeader' includes 'require(msg.sender == leaderAddress);', which enforces that only the specified address can execute the
                      function. This satisfies characteristic 1 entirely with no structural omissions.
        There are ['saleAuction'] should be checked in variable saleAuction
        Checked variables: saleAuction
            No The provided function 'setSaleAuctionAddress' is not a constructor, as its name does not match the contract name 'HeroAuction' and it is not explicitly
            named 'constructor'. Additionally, the state variable 'saleAuction' in the function is not hardcoded; rather, it is set using a parameter '_address'. Hence,
            no characteristics are satisfied.
            Function Security Analysis for HeroAuction.setSaleAuctionAddress(address)
                The modifier of function setSaleAuctionAddress are ['onlyLeader']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyLeader is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The code uses 'require(msg.sender == leaderAddress);' which directly checks if the function caller is the specified leader address. This
                      satisfies the first characteristic where only specific addresses can execute the function.
        There are ['saleAuction'] should be checked in variable saleAuction
        Checked variables: saleAuction
            No The provided code contains a function "setSaleAuctionAddress" which is not a constructor as the function name does not match the contract name
            "HeroAuction" nor is it explicitly named 'constructor'. Also, the function does not hardcode the state variable "saleAuction" as it assigns the state variable
            with a value from the parameter "_address" which is not hardcoded.
            Function Security Analysis for HeroAuction.setSaleAuctionAddress(address)
                The modifier of function setSaleAuctionAddress are ['onlyLeader']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyLeader is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The modifier uses the require statement to enforce that only the address stored in leaderAddress can execute the function, which matches the
                      first characteristic of checking if only the owner or specific addresses can execute the function. No lock or unlock operations were found, hence
                      structure 2 does not apply.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
