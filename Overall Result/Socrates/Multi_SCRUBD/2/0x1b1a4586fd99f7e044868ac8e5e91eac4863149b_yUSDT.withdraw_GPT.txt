Function Security Analysis for yUSDT.withdraw(uint256)
    The modifier of function withdraw are ['nonReentrant']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier nonReentrant has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The code initially increments a counter to set a guard. After executing the main function logic (denoted by "_"), it checks the counter's integrity to
          ensure it matches the expected value. However, there's no explicit lock and unlock flag pattern hereâ€”rather, it ensures function entry is valid through counter
          checking. This doesn't fully adhere to rule 2 as there is no unlock mechanism but implies some safeguarding against reentrancy unmatched to rule 2.
    Check direct function security
        - function yUSDT.withdraw(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any kind of check or statement related to verifying if msg.sender is equal to any of the roles or addresses like
          xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO or the inverse checks. It only includes logic for calculations, transfers, and conditions related to resource balances, not
          sender authorization.
        - function yUSDT.withdraw(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures. It uses `require` statements to check conditions, but these do not match the
          patterns provided because they do not immediately proceed to assign the same variable a new value.

        - function yUSDT.usdtToETH(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures that involve msg.sender with ownership or specific address checks as required.
        - function yUSDT.usdtToETH(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not have any statements that match the defined structures. Specifically, it lacks a 'require' or 'if' statement with the specified
          conditions involving a variable transition from true to false or from false to true.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

        Function Security Analysis for yUSDT.withdraw(uint256)
            The modifier of function withdraw are ['nonReentrant']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier nonReentrant is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The code structure shows that the modifier nonReentrant increases the _guardCounter by 1 and checks the consistency of this counter at the end
                  of the function execution using require. This pattern is consistent with a lock mechanism as it sets a flag (_guardCounter) to manage reentrancy, though
                  it doesn't explicitly set a boolean lock flag to true or false. Therefore, the entire lock and unlock mechanism is implemented within this counting
                  strategy, fulfilling the requirements of condition 2 through characteristic 3 as per its naming convention.
