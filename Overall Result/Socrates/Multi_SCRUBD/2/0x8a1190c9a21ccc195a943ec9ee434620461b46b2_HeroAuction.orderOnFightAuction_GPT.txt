        Checked variables: fightAuction
            No The provided function is not a constructor since its name is 'setFightAuctionAddress', which does not match the contract name 'HeroAuction' or explicitly
            named 'constructor'. Additionally, the function does not hardcode the provided state variable 'fightAuction', as it is set to the value of
            'candidateContract', which is passed as a parameter. Therefore, the function does not meet any of the specified characteristics.
            Function Security Analysis for HeroAuction.setFightAuctionAddress(address)
                The modifier of function setFightAuctionAddress are ['onlyLeader']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyLeader is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The code includes the statement `require(msg.sender == leaderAddress);`, which enforces that only the leader can execute the function. This
                      fulfills rule 1.
        There are ['fightAuction'] should be checked in variable fightAuction
        Checked variables: fightAuction
            No 1. The function name 'setFightAuctionAddress' does not match the contract name 'HeroAuction', and it is not named 'constructor', so it is not a
            constructor. 2. The function does not hardcode the state variable 'fightAuction'; instead, it assigns it based on the input parameter '_address'.
            Function Security Analysis for HeroAuction.setFightAuctionAddress(address)
                The modifier of function setFightAuctionAddress are ['onlyLeader']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyLeader is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: Upon re-evaluation, in the given code modifier 'onlyLeader', there is a direct requirement check 'require(msg.sender == leaderAddress);'
                      which matches Rule 1. This confirms that the code enforces that only a specific address (leaderAddress) can execute the function. There are no
                      structural omissions for Rule 1, as the presence of 'require' clearly indicates restricted access based on msg.sender.
        There are ['fightAuction'] should be checked in variable fightAuction
        Checked variables: fightAuction
            No The provided function is named 'setFightAuctionAddress', which neither matches the contract name 'HeroAuction' nor is it named 'constructor', thus it is
            not a constructor function.  The function is designed to set the 'fightAuction' state variable with a new instance of 'FightClockAuction', but it does not
            hardcode a value for the 'fightAuction' variable; instead, it takes an address as a parameter and requires that the address point to a valid
            'FightClockAuction'. Therefore, it does not satisfy the second characteristic either.
            Function Security Analysis for HeroAuction.setFightAuctionAddress(address)
                The modifier of function setFightAuctionAddress are ['onlyLeader']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyLeader is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: Upon reviewing the code, the modifier 'onlyLeader' uses 'require(msg.sender == leaderAddress);' to restrict access to only the
                      'leaderAddress'. This directly matches rule 1, which looks for such a requirement statement to ensure only the owner or specific addresses can
                      execute the function. There are no structural omissions as this code snippet clearly satisfies rule 1.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: HeroFighting._fight(uint32,uint32)
Function Security Analysis for HeroFighting._fight(uint32,uint32)
    The modifier of function _fight are ['whenNotPaused']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier whenNotPaused has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier does not enforce caller identity checks or lock operations, and its name 'whenNotPaused' indicates only a state check.
    Check direct function security
        - function HeroFighting._fight(uint32,uint32) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any require/assert statements involving msg.sender with xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
        - function HeroFighting._fight(uint32,uint32) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code contains an `if(!flag)` statement with swapping of _yinId and _yangId inside the block. However, it does not include setting `flag` to true
          within this structure, and also `flag` is not involved in a `require` like statement as per the specifications given. Therefore, it does not fully match the
          structure 4.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

        Function Security Analysis for HeroAuction.orderOnFightAuction(uint256,uint256,uint256)
            The modifier of function orderOnFightAuction are ['whenNotPaused']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier whenNotPaused has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The code checks if a certain condition ('!paused') is met before allowing the function to continue, but it does not explicitly check for an
                  owner or specific address. It does not set or reset a flag for reentrancy protection. It also does not have a function name suggesting ownership or
                  reentrancy protection. Therefore, it does not meet any of the specified criteria.

                  Reason: The function does not include any access control mechanism checking for specific roles or ownership within the provided conditions. It primarily
                  focuses on checking the ownership of the _yinId and balance checks for transaction validity, but none match the specific structures outlined in the
                  task.
                - function HeroAuction.orderOnFightAuction(uint256,uint256,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not satisfy any of the specified structures. There are no 'require' or 'if' statements followed by variable assignments that match
                  the described characteristics.

                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyLeader is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The code contains a 'require' statement that checks if 'msg.sender' is equal to 'leaderAddress', which enforces that only a specific address
                      can execute the function. This matches rule 1 precisely.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
