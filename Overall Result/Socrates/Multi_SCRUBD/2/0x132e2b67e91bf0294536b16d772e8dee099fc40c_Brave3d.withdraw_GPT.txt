Start analyze function: Brave3d.withdraw()
Function Security Analysis for Brave3d.withdraw()
    The modifier of function withdraw are ['hasEarnings']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier hasEarnings has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier does not enforce ownership or specific address checks, and it doesn't use a lock operation. It solely checks the value map balance for the
          sender.
    Check direct function security
        - function Brave3d.withdraw() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any checks or assertions comparing msg.sender with an owner or specific address (like xxxOwner, CEO).
        - function Brave3d.withdraw() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not follow any of the required structures. It doesn't have any 'require' statements or conditions involving setting a variable to a
          boolean value after checking it initially.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['msg.sender.transfer(amount)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - msg.sender.transfer(amount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        'msg.sender.transfer(amount)' contains the '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: Brave3d.overStage(uint8)
Function Security Analysis for Brave3d.overStage(uint8)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function overStage.
    Check direct function security
        - function Brave3d.overStage(uint8) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any checks for the identity of `msg.sender` against any owner, address, leader, or CEO. It does include assertions and logic
          related to the state of the stage and players, but not related to the caller's identity.
        - function Brave3d.overStage(uint8) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon reviewing the code, it contains 'assert(!finishStage.isFinish);' but directly setting 'finishStage.isFinish = true;' does not follow immediately
          after. The second statement for the pattern isn't present before any logic that might depend on it. Therefore, the second statement of setting the same variable
          to true is missing right after the first, violating any required pattern.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['buyFromValue', 'setName', 'buyByAddress', 'buyByName', 'withdraw', 'forceOverStage']
        Function Security Analysis for Brave3d.buyFromValue(uint8)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function buyFromValue.
            Check direct function security
                - function Brave3d.buyFromValue(uint8) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: No statements matching the specified patterns were found in the function code.
                - function Brave3d.buyFromValue(uint8) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code contains require statements, but none of the patterns that include resetting a variable to True or False after the require check are
                  present.
External Call Analysis

    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - p3dContract.myDividends(true) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - p3dContract.withdraw() ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - p3dContract.buy.value(P3D_VALUE*rate)(address(OFFICIAL_P3D)) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['p3dContract.myDividends(true)', 'p3dContract.withdraw()', 'p3dContract.buy.value(P3D_VALUE*rate)(address(OFFICIAL_P3D))']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['p3dContract'] should be checked in variable p3dContract
        Checked variables: p3dContract
            State variable p3dContract has initialized in public area after declaration.
        There are ['p3dContract'] should be checked in variable p3dContract
        Checked variables: p3dContract
            State variable p3dContract has initialized in public area after declaration.
        There are ['p3dContract'] should be checked in variable p3dContract
        Checked variables: p3dContract
            State variable p3dContract has initialized in public area after declaration.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
