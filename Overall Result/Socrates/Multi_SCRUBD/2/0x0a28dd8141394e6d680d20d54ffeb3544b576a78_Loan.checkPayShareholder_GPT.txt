Function Security Analysis for Loan.checkPayShareholder()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function checkPayShareholder.
    Check direct function security
        - function Loan.checkPayShareholder() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The provided code doesn't have any line that checks whether the msg.sender is an owner, address, leader, or CEO in any of the specified structures.
        - function Loan.checkPayShareholder() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: There are no require statements or throw statements modifying a variable to true or false as required by the specified structures in the provided
          function code.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['autoCheckPayShareholder', 'userRefund', '_userRefund']
        Function Security Analysis for Loan.autoCheckPayShareholder()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function autoCheckPayShareholder.
            Check direct function security
                - function Loan.autoCheckPayShareholder() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain any structure related to checking if msg.sender is equal to xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO, nor does it involve
                  msg.sender in any way. It uses the variable 'userEtherOf' and 'shareholder', but those are not related to checking the sender's address. Hence, it does
                  not satisfy any of the characteristics.
                - function Loan.autoCheckPayShareholder() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structural patterns that involve requiring a variable to be True or False and then flipping its
                  value to the opposite. It simply has an 'if' condition and calls a function inside it. There's no variable being set to True or False explicitly after a
                  condition check.
            Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
            There are no reachable function for internal/private function, please manually check its successor contracts.
        Function Security Analysis for Loan.userRefund()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function userRefund.
            Check direct function security
                - function Loan.userRefund() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any 'msg.sender' checks against specific authority roles like Owner, Address, Leader, or CEO to restrict access.
                  It only passes 'msg.sender' to another function '_userRefund', without implementing any conditional access structure as described.
                - function Loan.userRefund() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided function does not contain any statements with the structures that involve 'require' or 'if' statements which perform checks on a
                  boolean variable as described in the rules. It simply calls another function and returns its result.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['shareholder.transfer(toShareHolder)', 'token.profitOrgPay.value(toShareHolder)()']
    Analyze Transfer
        - shareholder.transfer(toShareHolder) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains
        '.transfer(' keyword, which satisfies the first condition.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - token.profitOrgPay.value(toShareHolder)() ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['token.profitOrgPay.value(toShareHolder)()']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['shareholder'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: shareholder
        There are no function that assign and initialize this variable. Please further manually check on successor contracts or modifiers.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
