Function Security Analysis for Swap.fallback()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
    Check direct function security
        - function Swap.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: There is no check or assertion that directly compares `msg.sender` to any specific owner, address, leader, or CEO within the function.
        - function Swap.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: In the provided code, require(check[msg.sender] == false); is followed by the main logic of the function before check[msg.sender] = true;. The state
          negation (check[msg.sender] = true;) does not occur immediately after the require statement, and instead occurs after a significant portion of the function's
          logic is executed.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['swapaddress.transfer(msg.sender,amount/thirdvalue)', 'swapaddress.transfer(msg.sender,5000000)', 'msg.sender.send(msg.value)',
    'beneficiary.send(msg.value)', 'swapaddress.transfer(msg.sender,amount/secondvalue)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - swapaddress.transfer(msg.sender,amount/thirdvalue) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - swapaddress.transfer(msg.sender,5000000) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - msg.sender.send(msg.value) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call contains '.send('.. Parameter in
        'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - beneficiary.send(msg.value) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call contains '.send('.. Parameter
        in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - swapaddress.transfer(msg.sender,amount/secondvalue) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - swapaddress.transfer(msg.sender,amount/thirdvalue) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - swapaddress.transfer(msg.sender,5000000) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - swapaddress.transfer(msg.sender,amount/secondvalue) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['swapaddress.transfer(msg.sender,amount/thirdvalue)', 'swapaddress.transfer(msg.sender,5000000)',
    'swapaddress.transfer(msg.sender,amount/secondvalue)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['swapaddress'] should be checked in variable swapaddress
        Checked variables: swapaddress
            Yes The given code is a constructor because it is explicitly named 'constructor', which matches the characteristic 1 description.
        There are ['swapaddress'] should be checked in variable swapaddress
        Checked variables: swapaddress
            Yes The function in the provided code is marked as a constructor as it uses the keyword 'constructor'. This satisfies the first characteristic that we check
            for: whether the function is a constructor.
        There are ['swapaddress'] should be checked in variable swapaddress
        Checked variables: swapaddress
            Yes The provided code is a constructor since its name is 'constructor', which explicitly indicates that this is a constructor function according to Solidity
            syntax defined for constructors. Additionally, the constructor sets the state variable 'swapaddress' using a parameter ('addressOfCollectibleUsedAsReward')
            rather than a hardcoded value.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
