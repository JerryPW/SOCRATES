Function Security Analysis for NamiExchange.sellNac(uint256,address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function sellNac.
    Check direct function security
        - function NamiExchange.sellNac(uint256,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any condition that directly checks if `msg.sender` is equal to or not equal to an owner, address, leader, or CEO as indicated
          in any of the described patterns.
        - function NamiExchange.sellNac(uint256,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code provided uses the require statement but does not alter the checked variable(s) immediately after the requirement, nor does it follow the
          specific structures outlined that involve changing the boolean state of a variable after a requirement or throw statement. No matched structure is found.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['namiToken.transferFrom(msg.sender,_buyer,_value)', 'namiToken.allowance(msg.sender,this)', 'msg.sender.send(ethOfBuyer)',
    'namiToken.transferFrom(msg.sender,_buyer,maxToken)', 'msg.sender.send(eth)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - msg.sender.send(ethOfBuyer) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call contains '.send(', which
        satisfies the criteria.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - msg.sender.send(eth) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call contains '.send(', which satisfies the
        criteria.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - namiToken.transferFrom(msg.sender,_buyer,_value) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - namiToken.allowance(msg.sender,this) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - namiToken.transferFrom(msg.sender,_buyer,maxToken) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['namiToken.transferFrom(msg.sender,_buyer,_value)', 'namiToken.allowance(msg.sender,this)',
    'namiToken.transferFrom(msg.sender,_buyer,maxToken)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['NamiAddr'] should be checked in variable namiToken
        Checked variables: NamiAddr
            Yes 1. The function is named 'NamiExchange', which matches the contract name 'NamiExchange'. This indicates that the function is a constructor. In Solidity
            versions prior to 0.4.22, constructors were identified by having the same name as the contract. In newer versions, the explicit keyword 'constructor' is used,
            but this code is likely for an older version or exhibits this pattern. 2. The state variable 'NamiAddr' is not hardcoded in the function. It is being set by
            the parameter '_namiAddress'.
        There are ['NamiAddr'] should be checked in variable namiToken
        Checked variables: NamiAddr
            Yes The function name 'NamiExchange' matches the contract name 'NamiExchange', indicating that this function is a constructor.
        There are ['NamiAddr'] should be checked in variable namiToken
        Checked variables: NamiAddr
            Yes The code contains a function named 'NamiExchange' which matches the contract name 'NamiExchange'. This indicates that the function is likely a
            constructor. Therefore, the function satisfies the first characteristic.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
