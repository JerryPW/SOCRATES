    There are no modifiers should be examined in function stake.
    Check direct function security
        - function YZYVault.stake() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any condition that checks if msg.sender is equal to any xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
        - function YZYVault.stake() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code contains the statement 'require(!isContract(_msgSender()), ...)', which matches the third structure listed: require(!xxx); xxx = True;.
          However, there is no explicit 'xxx = True;' statement related to 'isContract', so it does not fulfill the full structure. None of the structures are fully
          matched in this code.

    There are no modifiers should be examined in function claimSwapReward.
    Check direct function security
        - function YZYVault.claimSwapReward() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any checks or statements that explicitly involve verifying if `msg.sender` is equal or not equal to an owner, address, leader,
          CEO, or similar role, according to the structures discussed.
        - function YZYVault.claimSwapReward() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code doesn't have any matching structure as described. There are no require statements or if statements that follow the specified pattern related to
          setting a boolean variable.

            No 1. The function is not named after the contract, 'YZYVault', nor is it explicitly named 'constructor'.  2. The function, 'changeYzyAddress', does not have
            hardcoded the address of the provided state variable '_yzy'. Instead, it assigns '_yzy' dynamically based on the input parameter 'yzy'.
            Function Security Analysis for YZYVault.changeYzyAddress(address)
                The modifier of function changeYzyAddress are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The code snippet contains `require(_owner == _msgSender())` which enforces that only the specific address (owner) can execute the function,
                      meeting rule 1. There is no indication of a lock operation as described in rule 2. Only rule 1 is applicable here.

Function Security Analysis for YZYVault._sendLotteryAmount()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _sendLotteryAmount.
    Check direct function security
        - function YZYVault._sendLotteryAmount() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not have any condition that explicitly checks if msg.sender is equal or not equal to any owner or leader address variables, as
          described in the conditions.
        - function YZYVault._sendLotteryAmount() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code snippet checks a condition with a boolean variable (`!_enabledLottery`), which is akin to checking `require(!_enabledLottery)` if this were a
          contract requiring certain conditions. The variable `_enabledLottery` is initially checked for a `false` condition, then logically set to true upon fulfillment
          of other conditions ('enabled' for a transaction), satisfying structure 3 partially. The rest of the logic and usage do not clearly follow the specified
          structures directly. Therefore, it doesn't strictly meet any of the listed structures.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

            Check direct function security
                - function YZYVault.claimSwapReward() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain any checks related to 'msg.sender' being compared directly to xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO using 'require', 'if', or
                  'assert'.
                - function YZYVault.claimSwapReward() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The function `claimSwapReward` does not contain any of the structures mentioned in the criteria provided. Specifically, it lacks any 'require'
                  statements or 'if' statements that match the patterns described. The function deals with rewards processing, burning a portion of rewards, and setting a
                  last claimed block, but it does not contain checks or state changes in the pattern matching of require or if as prescribed.

                The modifier of function changeYzyAddress are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The modifier uses require to check if _msgSender() is equal to _owner, ensuring that only the owner can execute the function. This matches
                      the first condition that checks for owner or specific address restrictions.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

    Check direct function security
        - function YZYVault.claimYzyReward() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code doesn't contain any statements checking if msg.sender is equal to some owner or specific user address related to administrative control like
          Owner, Leader, etc. The verification or permission logic based on msg.sender is not present according to the specified conditions.
        - function YZYVault.claimYzyReward() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not fit any of the specified structures. There are require statements, but they do not check if a variable is strictly True or False, nor
          is there a sequence immediately setting that variable to its opposite state. Also, the use of 'require' in the code is not followed by changing the same
          variable's value, which disqualifies it from the patterns provided.

                The modifier of function changeYzyAddress are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The modifier onlyOwner contains the require statement that checks if _msgSender() is equal to _owner, enforcing that only the owner can
                      execute the function. This matches the description in structure 1.

    Check direct function security
        - function YZYVault.swapAndLiquifyForYZY(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not include any access control mechanism involving 'msg.sender'.
        - function YZYVault.swapAndLiquifyForYZY(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not match any of the specified structures. It doesn't contain any 'require', 'if', or variable condition assignments that match the
          format outlined in the rule set (e.g., require statements that toggle the variable, etc.).

                - function YZYVault.stake() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code includes a require(!isContract(_msgSender()), "Vault: Could not be contract."); statement, which matches the structure: require(!xxx);
                  xxx = True;. However, it doesn't alter the condition as it doesn't later set isContract or any related flag to True.

        - function YZYVault._swapAndClaimTokens(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The given code does not contain any statements that match the specified structures for checking 'msg.sender'. It primarily uses 'require' statements for
          condition checks of various other parameters and operations within the function, but none involving 'msg.sender'.
        - function YZYVault._swapAndClaimTokens(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not contain any of the defined structures with require statements modifying a boolean variable. All require statements check

        - function YZYVault.safeYzyTransfer(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The provided function does not have any conditions related to msg.sender checking against an owner or leader address. It simply performs a balance check
          and transfers tokens based on the available balance, without any assertions or require statements involving msg.sender.
        - function YZYVault.safeYzyTransfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not check any condition using 'require(xxx == True)', 'require(xxx == False)', 'require(!xxx)', or 'if(!xxx) throw' statements.
          Therefore, it does not satisfy any of the structures mentioned in the prompt.  The function simply checks if 'amount' is greater than 'yzyBal' and transfers
          'yzyBal' or 'amount' accordingly. There are no require statements or if-throw constructs dealing with a boolean condition for a variable that is set to True or

                        - function YZYVault.stake() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                          Reason: Upon closer inspection, the code includes the statement `require(!isContract(_msgSender()), "Vault: Could not be contract.");`, which
                          matches part of structure 3: `require(!xxx);`. However, the subsequent statement `xxx = True;` is not present. Both statements need to be
                          present for the structure to be fully matched. Therefore, the code does not fully conform to any of the described structures.

                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The modifier 'onlyOwner' includes the statement 'require(_owner == _msgSender(), "Ownable: caller is not the owner")'. This matches rule 1,
                      as it enforces that only the owner can execute the function by checking if the message sender is equal to the owner address. There are no mentions
                      of locking and unlocking in the code, so rule 2 does not apply, and only rule 1 is applicable. No structural omissions were found.
        There are ['_uniswapV2Router'] should be checked in variable _uniswapV2Router
        Checked variables: _uniswapV2Router
            Yes The provided code is clearly a constructor function. It is specifically named 'constructor' and matches the criteria for a characteristic where the
            function name indicates it is a contract constructor. This satisfies the first characteristic of being a constructor by checking if the function is explicitly

                  Reason: The given function does not include any checks or conditions related to `msg.sender` that match the required structures.
                - function YZYVault.swapAndLiquifyForYZY(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures. It does not have a 'require' statement or 'if (!xxx) throw' followed by an
                  assignment to the same variable later in the code sequence.
            Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

                    Check direct function security
                        - function YZYVault.stake() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                          Reason: The function does not contain ownership or access control logic involving msg.sender being compared or required to be an owner, leader
                          or CEO.
                        - function YZYVault.stake() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                          Reason: Upon re-evaluation of the code, the statement 'require(!isContract(_msgSender()), ...);' only matches the first part of the structure
                          type 3. However, there is no subsequent statement 'isContract(_msgSender()) = True;' or equivalent operation in the code. Therefore, the code
                          does not fully meet the criteria required for any of the specified structures.

                          Reason: The code does not contain any conditional statements involving 'msg.sender' comparisons for owner or specific role verification as
                          outlined in the criteria.
                        - function YZYVault.claimSwapReward() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                          Reason: The code does not contain any of the required structures that meet the characteristics specified. There are no 'require' statements or
                          conditional checks that use '!xxx', and the given examples indicate a need for explicit state checks and changes which this code lacks.

            There are ['_yzy'] should be checked in variable _yzy
            Checked variables: _yzy
                No The function provided is named 'changeYzyAddress' which does not match the contract name 'YZYVault', nor is it explicitly named 'constructor'.
                Therefore, it does not satisfy the constructor characteristic.  Additionally, the function 'changeYzyAddress' modifies the state variable '_yzy' by
                assigning it a new value given as a parameter ('yzy'), meaning it is not hardcoded. The state variable is updated dynamically through the argument
                provided to the function, rather than being assigned a constant or pre-defined value within the function. This does not satisfy the characteristic of
                having a hardcoded state variable.
            Function Security Analysis for YZYVault.changeYzyAddress(address)
                The modifier of function changeYzyAddress are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: Rule 1: The modifier includes a check that requires the caller (_msgSender()) to be the owner (_owner), demonstrating that only the owner
                      can execute the function. There are no structural omissions in this part, as the requirement checks are clearly outlined in the code.
            There are ['_weth'] should be checked in variable _weth
            Checked variables: _weth
                Yes The provided code is a constructor for the contract. This can be deduced from the function name matching the keyword 'constructor' and the presence of
                initialization logic for state variables. Additionally, the state variable '_weth' is being initialized with passed-in parameters, but this does not count
                as hardcoded, which means the second characteristic is not satisfied.
            There are ['_weth'] should be checked in variable _weth
            Checked variables: _weth
                Yes 1. The provided code is a constructor as the function name is "constructor", which is explicitly identified as a constructor. 2. The constructor
                assigns a state variable `_weth` from the input parameter `weth`, but there is no hardcoded value for `_weth`.
        There are ['_uniswapV2Router'] should be checked in variable _uniswapV2Router
        Checked variables: _uniswapV2Router
            Yes The provided code matches the first characteristic because it is a constructor function. The function is explicitly named 'constructor', which indicates
            it initializes the contract state when the contract is deployed. Additionally, it sets the state variable '_uniswapV2Router' with a hardcoded address,
            satisfying the second characteristic as well.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
