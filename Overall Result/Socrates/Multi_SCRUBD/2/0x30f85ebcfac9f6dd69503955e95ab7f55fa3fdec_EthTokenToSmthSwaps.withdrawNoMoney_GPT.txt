    Analyze External Address
        There are ['swaps'] should be checked in variable swap
        Checked variables: swaps
            No 1. The function names provided in the code snippet do not match the contract name `EthTokenToSmthSwaps` and none of them are explicitly named
            'constructor'. Therefore, no function is a constructor.  2. There is a state variable `swaps` mentioned in the contract. However, none of the functions appear
            to have hardcoded a value to this `swaps` variable. The state variable `swaps` appears to be initialized or updated based on function parameters or
            calculations, rather than being assigned a hardcoded constant value.   Since neither of the characteristics are satisfied, the answer is 'No'.
            Function Security Analysis for EthTokenToSmthSwaps.createSwap(bytes20,address,uint256,address)
                There are no modifiers should be examined in function createSwap.
                Check direct function security
                    - function EthTokenToSmthSwaps.createSwap(bytes20,address,uint256,address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                      Reason: The function does not check if msg.sender is any form of xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO.
                    - function EthTokenToSmthSwaps.createSwap(bytes20,address,uint256,address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                      Reason: The code uses require statements for validations and does not contain variable reassignments that match the specified patterns. Nothing
                      checks for boolean values or flips their states as described.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
