    Check direct function security
        - function bebBUYtwo.setUSDT(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any require, if or assert statements controlling access to msg.sender based on its relation to a specific owner, address,
          leader, or CEO. The only require statements are checking for value conditions and existing investment conditions, not sender authority.
        - function bebBUYtwo.setUSDT(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code contains a 'require' statement, but it does not satisfy any of the specified structures. The 'require' condition checks if _value is greater
          than or equal to 10000000 and if _user.amount is 0, which is not related to checking a boolean flag and then changing it.
