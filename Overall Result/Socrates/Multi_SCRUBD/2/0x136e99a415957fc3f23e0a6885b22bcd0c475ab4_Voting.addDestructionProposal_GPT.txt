Function Security Analysis for Voting.addDestructionProposal(string)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function addDestructionProposal.
    Check direct function security
        - function Voting.addDestructionProposal(string) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function uses 'require' for a condition unrelated to 'msg.sender'.
        - function Voting.addDestructionProposal(string) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: In the given code, after the 'require' check '!queued[uint(Subject.Destruction)]', the state negation operation 'queued[uint(Subject.Destruction)] =
          true;' happens after executing 'addProposal(Subject.Destruction, _reason);'. This means the state negation is not performed immediately after the check but
          occurs after an intermediate function call. Therefore, it does not meet the requirement of performing the state negation immediately before the main logic
          executes.

Start analyze function: Voting.addProposal(Voting.Subject,string)
Function Security Analysis for Voting.addProposal(Voting.Subject,string)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function addProposal.
    Check direct function security
        - function Voting.addProposal(Voting.Subject,string) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any condition that explicitly checks if `msg.sender` is equal to a specific owner, address, or similar controlled entity. It
          only contains requirements related to `msg.value` and the state of another contract.
        - function Voting.addProposal(Voting.Subject,string) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not satisfy any of the specified structures as it does not include any require statement with a variable comparison or any sequential
          assignment of a boolean variable after a require statement according to the specified patterns.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['addDestructionProposal', 'addRaiseTapProposal']
        Function Security Analysis for Voting.addDestructionProposal(string)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function addDestructionProposal.
            Check direct function security
                - function Voting.addDestructionProposal(string) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not check for the msg.sender against any owner or authorized position. It only checks if a proposal is not yet queued, hence
                  the function does not satisfy any of the specified characteristics.
                - function Voting.addDestructionProposal(string) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: In the code, the check `require(!queued[uint(Subject.Destruction)]);` is followed by the call to `addProposal(Subject.Destruction, _reason);`
                  before `queued[uint(Subject.Destruction)] = true;`. The state negation operation on `queued[uint(Subject.Destruction)]` does not occur immediately after
                  the requirement check; instead, it happens after the main logic of the function that can affect the sequence. Therefore, it does not meet the
                  requirement for immediate state negation.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['DaicoPool(poolAddr).isStateProjectInProgress()', 'poolAddr.transfer(msg.value)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - poolAddr.transfer(msg.value) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: This external call contains
        '.transfer(' keyword, satisfying the first instruction.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - DaicoPool(poolAddr).isStateProjectInProgress() ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['DaicoPool(poolAddr).isStateProjectInProgress()']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['poolAddr'] should be checked in variable poolAddr
        Checked variables: poolAddr
            Yes The provided code is a constructor because it is explicitly named 'constructor'. Constructors are special functions in Solidity that are only executed
            once, when the contract is deployed, to initialize the contract's state variables.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
