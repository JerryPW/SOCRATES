Function Security Analysis for Deposit.ClaimMTU(bool)
    The modifier of function ClaimMTU are ['paused']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier paused has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier checks a boolean variable `Paused` to assert that it is not true. It does not enforce specific address access nor does it implement a lock
          mechanism. It simply allows functions to be paused, which does not satisfy any of the listed conditions.
    Check direct function security
        - function Deposit.ClaimMTU(bool) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function 'ClaimMTU' does not have any structure where 'msg.sender' is directly compared against an owner-like address or role such as 'xxxOwner',
          'xxxAddress', 'Leader', or 'CEO' using require, if, or assert statements as described in the given characteristics.
        - function Deposit.ClaimMTU(bool) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures. It has two require statements but they don't follow the given patterns that conclude with
          setting the boolean to True or False after a require statement.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['tokenTransfer.transfer(msg.sender,claimTokens)', 'getAddress(team).transfer(ethVal/20)', 'msg.sender.transfer(ethVal)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - tokenTransfer.transfer(msg.sender,claimTokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - getAddress(team).transfer(ethVal/20) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains
        '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - msg.sender.transfer(ethVal) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains '.transfer('
        keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - tokenTransfer.transfer(msg.sender,claimTokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['tokenTransfer.transfer(msg.sender,claimTokens)']
    Analyze External Address
        The variable 'tokenTransfer' in external call 'tokenTransfer.transfer(msg.sender,claimTokens)' has no state variable assigned in Deposit.ClaimMTU(bool). Therefore
        we check whether it has been hardcoded in the function.
            No The variable 'tokenTransfer' is initialized dynamically by calling 'token(tokenAddress)'. Here, 'tokenAddress' is obtained through a function call
            'getAddress('unit')', implying it can change based on external conditions or configurations. Thus, 'tokenTransfer' is not directly hardcoded but derived from
            potentially variable external data.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
