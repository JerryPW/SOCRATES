            Check direct function security
                - function PoCGame.donate() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The provided code does not have any access control checks that involve the msg.sender, like verifying if the sender is a specific owner,
                  address, leader, or CEO. There are no conditional checks that match any of the specified patterns.
                - function PoCGame.donate() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The given code is a function `donate` which contains only a call to another function `donateToWhale(msg.value)` and is governed by
                  `isOpenToPublic` modifier. It does not contain any require statements or throw blocks that alter the state of a boolean variable named `xxx`, hence it
                  does not satisfy any of the specified structures.
