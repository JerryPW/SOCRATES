    There are no modifiers should be examined in function distributeRef.
    Check direct function security
        - function SafeDif.distributeRef(uint256,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the required structures that explicitly check the identity of the sender against a particular owner or
          address. It lacks any require, if, or assert statements related to msg.sender as described in the specified patterns.
        - function SafeDif.distributeRef(uint256,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not meet any of the specified patterns. There are no "require" statements or equivalent "if" statements followed by state changes as
          outlined in the problem. The code primarily consists of calculations and transfers without using the specified control structures.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['invest', 'fallback']
        Function Security Analysis for SafeDif.invest(uint256,uint256)
            The modifier of function invest are ['isActivated']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier isActivated has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier checks if 'activated_' is true, which does not satisfy the owner-specific execution, lock operation, or function name inference
                  rules.
            Check direct function security
                - function SafeDif.invest(uint256,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The given code does not contain any of the specified structures checking for msg.sender against an xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
                - function SafeDif.invest(uint256,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code does not have any of the specified structures. It contains various `require` checks but does not meet the format with specific
                  state change as outlined in the provided structures.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['player_[_affID2].addr.transfer(_aff)', 'player_[_affID1].addr.transfer(_aff)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - player_[_affID2].addr.transfer(_aff) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the
        '.transfer(' keyword which matches the first characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - player_[_affID1].addr.transfer(_aff) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the
        '.transfer(' keyword which matches the first characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
