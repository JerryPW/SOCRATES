    There are no modifiers should be examined in function determinePID.
    Check direct function security
        - function MonkeyScam.determinePID(LDdatasets.EventReturns) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The provided function does not contain any explicit checks involving `msg.sender` that require or assert its equality to a specific owner or leader
          variable, nor any condition which throws or fails when `msg.sender` is not equal to such a variable. It primarily checks if a player ID (pID) is new and
          retrieves player details using PlayerBook contract calls.
        - function MonkeyScam.determinePID(LDdatasets.EventReturns) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any statements that match the required structures. It has conditionals and assignments, but none fit the specified patterns.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['fallback', 'buyXid', 'buyXname', 'buyXaddr']
        Function Security Analysis for MonkeyScam.fallback()
            The modifier of function fallback are ['isActivated', 'isHuman', 'isWithinLimits']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier isActivated has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier uses a flag 'activated_' to ensure certain conditions (activation) are met before the function can execute. This can be seen as
                  ensuring certain prerequisites or states are achieved rather than directly enforcing ownership access or lock operation. It doesn't explicitly match any
                  of the defined conditions related to owner or locking.
                - modifier isHuman has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier does not explicitly enforce that only the owner or specific addresses can execute the function, nor does it use a lock operation.
                  It checks if the caller is a non-contract (EOA) which does not fit into any specified rules. Additionally, the modifier name "isHuman" does not imply
                  characteristics like ownership or locks described in the rules.
                - modifier isWithinLimits has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier 'isWithinLimits' does not enforce owner or specific address execution, nor does it utilize a lock operation. It only checks if the
                  '_eth' value is within certain limits.
            Check direct function security
                - function MonkeyScam.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain any requirement, conditional check, or assertion comparing msg.sender to predefined roles such as Owner, Leader, or
                  CEO.
                - function MonkeyScam.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code doesn't contain any 'require' statement or any 'if' statement to check a condition and toggle a variable between true and false, so it
                  doesn't fit any of the specified code structures.
