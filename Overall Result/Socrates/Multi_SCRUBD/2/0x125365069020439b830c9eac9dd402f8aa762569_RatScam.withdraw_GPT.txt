Function Security Analysis for RatScam.withdraw()
    The modifier of function withdraw are ['isActivated', 'isHuman']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier isActivated has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier checks if a certain condition (activated_ == true) is met, but it does not specifically check for an owner or authorized address, nor does
          it use a lock mechanism. The modifier name 'isActivated' does not imply ownership or reentrancy protection based on standard naming conventions.
        - modifier isHuman has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier isHuman checks if the sender is an origin account, not a contract, but does not specifically limit execution to an owner or specific
          address, nor does it implement reentrancy protection.
    Check direct function security
        - function RatScam.withdraw() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any checks or assertions specifically related to the identity of msg.sender against any "xxxOwner", "xxxAddress",
          "Leader", or "CEO" roles.
        - function RatScam.withdraw() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code doesn't contain any of the specified structures with require statements or if condition throwing an exception with subsequent variable
          assignments as defined in the allowed patterns.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['plyr_[_pID].addr.transfer(_eth)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - plyr_[_pID].addr.transfer(_eth) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the
        '.transfer(' keyword, hence it satisfies one of the specified characteristics.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: RatScam.endRound(RSdatasets.EventReturns)
Function Security Analysis for RatScam.endRound(RSdatasets.EventReturns)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function endRound.
    Check direct function security
        - function RatScam.endRound(RSdatasets.EventReturns) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not include any direct access checks related to msg.sender against a specific owner or address as mentioned in the conditions.
        - function RatScam.endRound(RSdatasets.EventReturns) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code provided does not have any 'require(xxx == True);' or 'require(xxx == False);' statements, nor does it contain 'require(!xxx);' or any
          'if(!xxx) throw;' statements with the subsequent assignments as described in any of the given structures. Although there is an 'if' condition used to check for
          a failed call to 'RatKingCorp' with 'if (!address(RatKingCorp).call.value(_com)(bytes4(keccak256("deposit()"))))', it does not have a corresponding 'require' or
          'throw' structure as outlined in the specified patterns. Therefore, the function does not match any of the described structures.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['reLoadXid', 'buyXid', 'reLoadCore', 'reLoadXname', 'buyXname', 'fallback', 'buyCore', 'reLoadXaddr', 'buyXaddr', 'withdraw']
        Function Security Analysis for RatScam.reLoadXid(uint256,uint256)
            The modifier of function reLoadXid are ['isActivated', 'isHuman', 'isWithinLimits']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier isActivated has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier enforces a condition check on a variable 'activated_' to be true, which does not correspond to checking ownership or specific
                  address permissions (Rule 1) nor a lock mechanism to prevent re-entry (Rule 2). The function name 'isActivated' does not suggest access control or a
                  lock mechanism (Rule 3).
                - modifier isHuman has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier 'isHuman' requires that the msg.sender is the origin of the transaction. It does not enforce any ownership or specific address
                  checks, nor does it use any lock operations. The function name 'isHuman' does not imply ownership control or reentrancy protection as described in the
                  given characteristics.
                - modifier isWithinLimits has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The provided modifier does not have any code that enforces owner or specific address restrictions, nor does it include a lock mechanism to
                  prevent reentrant calls. It only checks if an input value is within a specified range.
            Check direct function security
                - function RatScam.reLoadXid(uint256,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not include any checks or assertions involving `msg.sender` against an owner, address, or similar role-based condition.
                - function RatScam.reLoadXid(uint256,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not have any statements that adhere to the specified structures.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['address(RatKingCorp).call.value(_com)(bytes4(keccak256()(deposit())))']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - address(RatKingCorp).call.value(_com)(bytes4(keccak256()(deposit()))) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['address(RatKingCorp).call.value(_com)(bytes4(keccak256()(deposit())))']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['RatKingCorp'] should be checked in variable RatKingCorp
        Checked variables: RatKingCorp
            State variable RatKingCorp has initialized in public area after declaration.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
