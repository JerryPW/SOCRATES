Function Security Analysis for Bozu.internalTransfer(address,address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function internalTransfer.
    Check direct function security
        - function Bozu.internalTransfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code doesn't contain any condition checking if 'msg.sender' is equal to or not equal to any owner/leader/CEO role directly. All conditions involve
          checking other addresses or states.
        - function Bozu.internalTransfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon re-evaluation, the previous assessment was incorrect. The code contains the statement `require(!isBot[from], "ERC20: Can not transfer from BOT")`,
          which matches part of the given structures. However, it does not have a corresponding `isBot[from] = True;` or similar statement following it. Thus, the full
          structure required for a 'Yes' judgment is not present. There are no other sections in the code that match any of the specified structures fully.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transfer', 'transferFrom', 'withdrawStuckTokens', 'manualBurnTokensFromLP', 'AirDrop']

            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transfer.
            Check direct function security
                - function Bozu.transfer(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The provided code does not include any checks related to msg.sender against any owner or leader, nor does it throw or require/assert such
                  checks.
                - function Bozu.transfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures. It is a simple function that performs an internal transfer and returns true
                  but does not include any 'require', 'if' statements or variable assignments in the described pattern.

Start analyze function: Bozu.taxTokenSwap()
Function Security Analysis for Bozu.taxTokenSwap()
    The modifier of function taxTokenSwap are ['lockTheSwap']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier lockTheSwap is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The modifier 'lockTheSwap' sets the 'inSwapAndLiquify' flag to true before running the function, and resets it to false afterward, thus implementing a
          lock mechanism as described in Rule 2. Both lock and unlock operations are present and matched correctly.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
