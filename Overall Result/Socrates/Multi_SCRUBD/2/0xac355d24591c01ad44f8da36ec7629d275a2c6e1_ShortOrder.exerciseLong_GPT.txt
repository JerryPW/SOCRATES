Function Security Analysis for ShortOrder.exerciseLong(address[2],uint256[8],uint8,bytes32[2])
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function exerciseLong.
    Check direct function security
        - function ShortOrder.exerciseLong(address[2],uint256[8],uint8,bytes32[2]) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not include any checks or assertions that specifically compare msg.sender to an owner, address, leader, or CEO variable.
        - function ShortOrder.exerciseLong(address[2],uint256[8],uint8,bytes32[2]) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code contains a condition 'else if(!orderRecord[msg.sender][orderHash].tokenDeposit)' which aligns with the characteristic structure of
          'require(!xxx); xxx = True;'. However, in the context of this function, there's no assignment changing 'orderRecord[msg.sender][orderHash].tokenDeposit'
          immediately after this condition. The structures given require both checking and explicitly changing the state of the same variable to/from True/False, not
          present here.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['Token(tokenUser[0]).transfer(msg.sender,amount)', 'msg.sender.transfer(couponAmount)',
    'msg.sender.transfer(safeAdd(couponAmount,orderRecord[tokenUser[1]][orderHash].longBalance[msg.sender]))']
    Analyze Transfer
        - Token(tokenUser[0]).transfer(msg.sender,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - msg.sender.transfer(couponAmount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call contains '.transfer('
        keyword, indicating a transfer operation.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - msg.sender.transfer(safeAdd(couponAmount,orderRecord[tokenUser[1]][orderHash].longBalance[msg.sender])) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no
        potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call contains '.transfer(' keyword, indicating a transfer operation.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - Token(tokenUser[0]).transfer(msg.sender,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['Token(tokenUser[0]).transfer(msg.sender,amount)']
    Analyze External Address
        The variable 'tokenUser' in external call 'Token(tokenUser[0]).transfer(msg.sender,amount)' has no state variable assigned in
        ShortOrder.exerciseLong(address[2],uint256[8],uint8,bytes32[2]). Therefore we check whether it has been hardcoded in the function.
            No The variable 'tokenUser' is an input parameter to the function and is used within the function logic without assigning or altering its initial value. The
            function performs operations based on the input data and current state but does not hardcode 'tokenUser'.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
