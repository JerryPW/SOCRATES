                The modifier of function changeYzyETHPair are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The modifier 'onlyOwner' clearly checks if the caller (_msgSender) is the same as the owner (_owner) through a require statement, matching
                      the first rule's condition.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: YZYVault._sendLotteryAmount()
Function Security Analysis for YZYVault._sendLotteryAmount()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _sendLotteryAmount.
    Check direct function security
        - function YZYVault._sendLotteryAmount() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any conditional checks using msg.sender, such as require or if statements, that restrict actions based on the identity of the
          message sender being an owner or leader type address.
        - function YZYVault._sendLotteryAmount() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code snippet includes the condition `if (!_enabledLottery || _lotteryAmount <= 0) return false;`, which matches the characteristic 3
          `{require(!xxx); xxx = True; ... xxx = False;}` format because `if (!_enabledLottery ...)` checks the negation of `_enabledLottery` and the function attempts
          operations which imply that `_enabledLottery` should be true for them to proceed. However, it doesn't strictly match the requirement statement-wise such as
          setting a variable to True or False post the check, hence it's not an exact match.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

            Check direct function security
                - function YZYVault.claimYzyAvailableReward() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The provided code does not have any checks involving `msg.sender` being compared to an owner or address role like Owner, Address, Leader, or
                  CEO. It only checks if a reward is available and successfully transferred.
                - function YZYVault.claimYzyAvailableReward() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not satisfy any of the 4 defined patterns because it does not have any 'require(xxx == True); xxx = False;' or 'require(xxx ==
                  False); xxx = True;' or 'require(!xxx); xxx = True;' or 'if(!xxx) throw; xxx = true;' patterns in the code. All the requirements use explicit

            it explicitly named 'constructor'.  Furthermore, the function does not hardcode the state variable '_yzy'; instead, it sets '_yzy' based on the input
            parameter 'yzy' provided when the function is called, meaning it is dynamically set by the function's execution rather than hardcoded.  Since the function
            does not satisfy either of the characteristics (matching contract name, being a constructor, or hardcoding a state variable), the output is 'No'.
            Function Security Analysis for YZYVault.changeYzyAddress(address)
                The modifier of function changeYzyAddress are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The modifier 'onlyOwner' checks if the msg.sender is the owner, following the rule 1 that requires the function to enforce that only the
                      owner or specific addresses can execute the function. The relevant part in the code is: require(_owner == _msgSender(), "Ownable: caller is not the
                      owner");

            Function Security Analysis for YZYVault.changeYzyAddress(address)
                The modifier of function changeYzyAddress are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The code uses 'require(_owner == _msgSender())', ensuring only the owner can execute the function. This satisfies rule 1. There are no
                      structural omissions as the relevant condition is present.

            No 1. The function 'changeYzyAddress' does not match the contract name 'YZYVault', nor is it explicitly named 'constructor'. Therefore, it is not a
            constructor. 2. The provided state variable is '_yzy'. In the code snippet, '_yzy' is assigned a value based on the input parameter 'yzy', which is not a
            hardcoded value. Instead, it is a dynamic value provided by the function caller.  As neither characteristic is satisfied, the function does not meet any of
            the provided conditions.
            Function Security Analysis for YZYVault.changeYzyAddress(address)
                The modifier of function changeYzyAddress are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The given `onlyOwner` modifier uses `require(_owner == _msgSender(), ...)`, ensuring that only the owner can execute the function. This
                      matches rule 1. The `onlyOwner` modifier has no indications of lock/unlock operations matching rule 2, thus the structural requirements for rule 2
                      are not applicable here.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

    Check direct function security
        - function YZYVault.safeYzyTransfer(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any statement that checks if 'msg.sender' is equal to or not equal to a certain owner, address or position (like Leader, CEO).
        - function YZYVault.safeYzyTransfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not involve any require statements or conditions using the logical not operator (!). Nor it uses throwing an error when a variable
          is false. Thus, it does not follow any of the identified structures.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

                - function YZYVault.stake() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain any checks or assertions specifically comparing msg.sender against an owner/leader/CEO address.
                - function YZYVault.stake() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: Upon re-evaluation, the code contains the statement 'require(!isContract(_msgSender()), ...)', which matches the condition where the function
                  requires a condition to be false. However, it lacks the subsequent 'xxx = True;' statement that the provided structures require. Therefore, the code
                  does not fully match any of the specified structures.

            No The function provided in the code is named 'changeYzyAddress' and not 'YZYVault' or 'constructor', indicating that it is not the constructor for the
            contract YZYVault. Moreover, the function changes the state variable '_yzy' to the address passed as a parameter 'yzy'. This means the state variable is
            dynamically set based on the parameter and not hardcoded. Therefore, it does not satisfy the condition of having a hardcoded state variable.
            Function Security Analysis for YZYVault.changeYzyAddress(address)
                The modifier of function changeYzyAddress are ['onlyOwner']

                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The modifier includes a require statement that enforces only the owner can execute the function, which matches one of the listed
                      characteristics (rule 1). The require statement is as follows: 'require(_owner == _msgSender(), "Ownable: caller is not the owner");'. This confirms
                      the modifier restricts access to the function.
        There are ['_yzy'] should be checked in variable _yzy
        Checked variables: _yzy
            No The given code is a function named `changeYzyAddress`, which does not match the contract name `YZYVault` and is not explicitly named 'constructor', so it
            does not satisfy the first characteristic. The function assigns the parameter `yzy` to the state variable `_yzy`, but it uses the value provided in the
            function parameter rather than a hardcoded value, so it does not satisfy the second characteristic either.

                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The provided modifier uses 'require(_owner == _msgSender())', which matches rule 1 as it enforces that only the owner can execute the
                      function.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

                Yes The code provided is a constructor for the contract 'YZYVault'. The function is named 'constructor', confirming it fulfills the criteria for
                characteristic 1 (this being the constructor of the contract). Although the state variable '_weth' is being set within the constructor, it is not
                hardcoded; rather, it is assigned through an argument passed to the constructor. Despite this, the function satisfies characteristic 1 on its own, which
                is sufficient to return 'Yes'.
        There are ['_uniswapV2Router'] should be checked in variable _uniswapV2Router
        Checked variables: _uniswapV2Router
            Yes The code provided is explicitly a constructor of the smart contract. The constructor is recognizable by its definition, starting with 'constructor(', and
            it initializes various state variables upon deployment of the smart contract. The constructor also hardcodes the '_uniswapV2Router' state variable with a
            specific address '0x7a250d5630B4cF539739dF2C5dAcb4c659F2488D'.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
