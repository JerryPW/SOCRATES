Function Security Analysis for TheWarRedNation.Sort()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function Sort.
    Check direct function security
        - function TheWarRedNation.Sort() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures that explicitly check msg.sender against an owner or leader variable before allowing
          execution.
        - function TheWarRedNation.Sort() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not have any 'require' statement or 'if' statements with throw, so it doesn't match with any given structures.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['fallback']
        Function Security Analysis for TheWarRedNation.fallback()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
            Check direct function security
                - function TheWarRedNation.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not have any checks related to msg.sender being compared to an ownership or authorized role like xxxOwner or xxxAddress.
                - function TheWarRedNation.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not match any of the specified structures. There's a 'require' statement, but it is not checking a boolean variable for true or
                  false. Instead, it checks if 'msg.value' is greater than or equal to '0.01 ether', which does not conform to the patterns requiring a boolean check
                  followed by an assignment to the boolean variable.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['owner.send(feecounter)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - owner.send(feecounter) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the '.send('
        keyword, which satisfies one of the specified characteristics.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
