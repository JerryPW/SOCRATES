Function Security Analysis for Crowdsale.fallback()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
    Check direct function security
        - function Crowdsale.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not check 'msg.sender' against any owner or specific address roles.
        - function Crowdsale.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon reviewing the code, the only matched statement in the provided structures is 'require(!crowdsaleClosed);'. However, the subsequent statement
          'crowdsaleClosed = True;' or any equivalent assignment statement for the variable 'crowdsaleClosed' is absent. Therefore, none of the given structure
          requirements that require both statements are fully satisfied in the code.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,amount*10000)', 'beneficiary.send(amount)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,amount*10000) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - beneficiary.send(amount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        'beneficiary.send(amount)' contains the '.send(' keyword, which is one of the criteria to satisfy the condition.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,amount*10000) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,amount*10000)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['tokenReward'] should be checked in variable tokenReward
        Checked variables: tokenReward
            Yes The function matches the contract name 'Crowdsale', which indicates that this is a constructor function. Constructor functions typically initialize the
            state of the contract and are expected to run once at the time of contract deployment. It also sets the state variable 'tokenReward', but this happens through
            a parameter and not a hardcoded value, thus it does not satisfy the second condition.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
