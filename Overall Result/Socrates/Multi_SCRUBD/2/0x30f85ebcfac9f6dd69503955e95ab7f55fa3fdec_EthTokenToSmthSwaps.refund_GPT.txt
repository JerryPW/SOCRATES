            No The provided code snippets are neither constructors, as none of the functions has the same name as the contract or is explicitly named 'constructor', nor
            do they hardcode any state variables. The state variable 'swaps' is used in multiple functions, but there is no indication of it being hardcoded with specific
            values in the manner described. Each function seems to work with dynamic inputs and stores or retrieves data accordingly.
