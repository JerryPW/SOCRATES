Function Security Analysis for DividendDistributor.distributeDividend(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function distributeDividend.
    Check direct function security
        - function DividendDistributor.distributeDividend(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code doesn't have a condition checking if msg.sender equals or not to xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
        - function DividendDistributor.distributeDividend(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures involving 'require' or 'if' statements with assignments to the same variable as outlined
          in the problem description.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['process', 'setShare', 'claimDividend']
        Function Security Analysis for DividendDistributor.process(uint256)
            The modifier of function process are ['onlyToken']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyToken is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The code in the modifier 'onlyToken' contains the statement 'require(msg.sender == _token);', which enforces that only the address stored in
                  '_token' can execute the function. This matches the first characteristic where the code enforces that only specific addresses can execute the function.
        Function Security Analysis for DividendDistributor.setShare(address,uint256)
            The modifier of function setShare are ['onlyToken']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyToken is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The modifier enforces that only the address stored in _token can execute the function by using 'require(msg.sender == _token);', which satisfies
                  rule 1. There are no structural omissions as the code explicitly checks the msg.sender condition.
        Function Security Analysis for DividendDistributor.claimDividend()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function claimDividend.
            Check direct function security
                - function DividendDistributor.claimDividend() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The provided code does not check msg.sender against any owner or specific address nor does it use require, if, or assert statements as
                  described.
                - function DividendDistributor.claimDividend() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any 'require' statement with a condition of the form 'xxx == True' or 'xxx == False'. There are also no 'if(!xxx)
                  throw' statements or changes to a boolean variable after such conditions. Therefore, it doesn't match any of the specified structures.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['rewardToken.transfer(shareholder,amount)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - rewardToken.transfer(shareholder,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - rewardToken.transfer(shareholder,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['rewardToken.transfer(shareholder,amount)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['rewardToken'] should be checked in variable rewardToken
        Checked variables: rewardToken
            Yes The function provided in the code is explicitly named 'constructor', which matches one of the conditions.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
