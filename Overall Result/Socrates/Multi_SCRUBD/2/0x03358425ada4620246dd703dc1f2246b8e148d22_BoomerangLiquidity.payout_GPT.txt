Function Security Analysis for BoomerangLiquidity.payout()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function payout.
    Check direct function security
        - function BoomerangLiquidity.payout() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures involving `msg.sender`.
        - function BoomerangLiquidity.payout() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code contains a require statement checking if `balance > 1` and other manipulations of `balance`, but it does not follow any of the specified
          structural patterns where a specific boolean condition is required and manipulated in the described manner. None of the conditions in the problem prompt, such
          as requiring a boolean being set to True or False, are directly applicable here, as the requirement is not on a boolean variable.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.call.value(payoutToSend).gas(1000000)()', 'participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.send(payoutToSend)',
    'weak_hands.buy.value(investment).gas(1000000)(msg.sender)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.send(payoutToSend) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: This call
        contains the '.send(' keyword, which satisfies the second characteristic for identification.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - The gas limit in participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.call.value(payoutToSend).gas(1000000)() is 1000000, which is too high. Therefore, it will not prevent
        REE problem.
        - The gas limit in weak_hands.buy.value(investment).gas(1000000)(msg.sender) is 1000000, which is too high. Therefore, it will not prevent REE problem.
    Remaining external call: ['participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.call.value(payoutToSend).gas(1000000)()',
    'weak_hands.buy.value(investment).gas(1000000)(msg.sender)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['participants'] should be checked in variable participants
        Checked variables: participants
            No The provided code does not contain a constructor function. The function names do not match the contract name 'BoomerangLiquidity' nor are they explicitly
            named 'constructor'. There is no hardcoding of the state variable 'participants'; instead, it's used dynamically by adding new participants and altering
            existing participant details during function calls.
            Function Security Analysis for BoomerangLiquidity.deposit()
                There are no modifiers should be examined in function deposit.
                Check direct function security
                    - function BoomerangLiquidity.deposit() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                      Reason: The code does not contain any authorization check against specific roles like xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO to control function access.
                    - function BoomerangLiquidity.deposit() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                      Reason: The given code does not contain any of the specified structures where a variable assignment follows a particular 'require' or 'if' condition
                      associated with that same variable. Therefore, it neither matches the patterns for changing a boolean condition nor contains any of the logical
                      statements or assignments described.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
