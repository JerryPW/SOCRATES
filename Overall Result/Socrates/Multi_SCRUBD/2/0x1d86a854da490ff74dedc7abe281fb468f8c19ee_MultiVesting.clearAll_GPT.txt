    The modifier of function clearAll are ['onlyOwner']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: Upon reviewing the code:  1. The modifier contains the line 'require(msg.sender == owner);', which enforces that only the owner can execute the
          function. This matches the first characteristic in the list that checks whether the code enforces owner or specific address execution.  There are no structural
          omissions pertaining to characteristic 1, as the require statement directly verifies the sender's address against the owner address ensuring this access
          control.  For characteristic 2, there are no lock and unlock operations in the code, so it doesn't satisfy the second characteristic.  Thus, the correct
          judgment remains the same based on the clearly present structure for characteristic 1.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
