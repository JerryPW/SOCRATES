Function Security Analysis for CompliantCrowdsaleHardcap._approveMint(uint256)
    The modifier of function _approveMint are ['checkIsInvestorApproved']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier checkIsInvestorApproved has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier checks if an account is approved by a `whiteListingContract`, but it doesn't specifically enforce only an owner or specific address can
          execute a function, nor does it involve any reentrancy lock operations. Thus, it doesn't satisfy any of the listed characteristics for outputting 'Yes'.
    Check direct function security
        - function CompliantCrowdsaleHardcap._approveMint(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any usage of msg.sender in structures like require, if, or assert to control access based on specific addresses. It primarily
          interacts with the msg.sender for event logging and does not check the sender's address for authorization.
        - function CompliantCrowdsaleHardcap._approveMint(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code provided does not contain any of the structures specified in the prompt. Specifically, it does not include any 'require' statements or
          conditional structures with 'if(!xxx) throw;' that check and then change the state of a boolean variable 'xxx' from true to false or false to true.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['approveMint', 'bulkApproveMints']
        Function Security Analysis for CompliantCrowdsaleHardcap.approveMint(uint256)
            The modifier of function approveMint are ['onlyValidator']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyValidator is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The answer remains consistent as the code in the 'onlyValidator' modifier directly includes the structure 'require(msg.sender == validator);',
                  which enforces that only the address stored in 'validator' can execute the function. There is no lock and unlock operation present, so structure 2 does
                  not apply. The requirement statements coincide with rule 1.
        Function Security Analysis for CompliantCrowdsaleHardcap.bulkApproveMints(uint256[])
            The modifier of function bulkApproveMints are ['onlyValidator']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyValidator is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The modifier 'onlyValidator' contains the line 'require(msg.sender == validator);' which enforces that only the specific address stored in
                  'validator' can execute the function. This satisfies Rule 1 regarding owner or specific address control. There are no lock operations present to satisfy
                  Rule 2.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
