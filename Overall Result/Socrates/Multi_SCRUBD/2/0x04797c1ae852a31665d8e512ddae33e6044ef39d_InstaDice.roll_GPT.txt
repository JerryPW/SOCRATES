Function Security Analysis for InstaDice.roll(uint8)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function roll.
    Check direct function security
        - function InstaDice.roll(uint8) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not include any checks or assertions for msg.sender against an owner or equivalent privileged account identifier.
        - function InstaDice.roll(uint8) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not have any structure that matches the four given patterns, as it lacks any 'require' statements or 'if' throwing logic with
          variable flipping as described.

Start analyze function: InstaDice._errorAndRefund(string,uint256,uint8)
Function Security Analysis for InstaDice._errorAndRefund(string,uint256,uint8)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _errorAndRefund.
    Check direct function security
        - function InstaDice._errorAndRefund(string,uint256,uint8) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not have any checks against msg.sender for ownership or specific roles.
        - function InstaDice._errorAndRefund(string,uint256,uint8) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the outlined structures. The function only uses 'require' with a call but does not involve an assignment of a boolean
          variable that satisfies the given conditions.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['_validateBetOrRefund', 'roll']
        Function Security Analysis for InstaDice._validateBetOrRefund(uint8)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function _validateBetOrRefund.
            Check direct function security
                - function InstaDice._validateBetOrRefund(uint8) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain any access control based on msg.sender like comparing it against an owner or leader variable.
                - function InstaDice._validateBetOrRefund(uint8) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The given code does not match any of the provided structures. It mainly consists of a series of condition checks and error handling, without
                  setting or requiring conditions on any variable in the manner described in the structures.
            Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
            The reachable functions are ['roll']
                Function Security Analysis for InstaDice.roll(uint8)
                    There are no modifiers should be examined in function roll.
                    Check direct function security
                        - function InstaDice.roll(uint8) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                          Reason: The code does not contain any checks related to specific addresses like xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO, thus none of the provided
                          patterns match.
                        - function InstaDice.roll(uint8) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                          Reason: The function does not have any of the specified structures. Conditions that would allow a 'Yes' answer are not present. It doesn't use
                          'require' with the specified variable patterns or 'if(!xxx) throw' structure with subsequent assignments to the same variable within the scope
                          of the function.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['msg.sender.call.value(msg.value)()']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - msg.sender.call.value(msg.value)() ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['msg.sender.call.value(msg.value)()']
    Analyze External Address
        External call msg.sender.call.value(msg.value)() calls msg.sender, which consider potential REE problem.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
