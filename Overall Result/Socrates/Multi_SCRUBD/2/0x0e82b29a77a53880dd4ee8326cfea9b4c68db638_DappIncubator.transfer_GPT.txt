          Reason: Upon re-evaluating the code, it matches none of the provided structures completely. While there is a statement
          `require(contractAddressRecord[contractAddress] == true);`, it's not followed by `contractAddressRecord[contractAddress] = false;`. The structure requires both
          statements to be considered a match.

Function Security Analysis for DappIncubator.withdraw(address)
    The modifier of function withdraw are ['nonReentrant']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier nonReentrant is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The code within the 'nonReentrant' modifier contains both a lock and an unlock operation. It sets _status to _ENTERED as a lock operation and later
          resets it back to _NOT_ENTERED as an unlock operation. This confirms the use of a lock operation as described in rule 2.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
