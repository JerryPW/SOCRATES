            However, the function does hardcode the state variable '_targetToken'. This is evident from the lines where '_targetToken' is assigned a specific contract
            address based on the 'targetSymbol' provided - either the USDT or USDC contract address. These addresses are hardcoded into the function logic based on the
            'targetSymbol'.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
