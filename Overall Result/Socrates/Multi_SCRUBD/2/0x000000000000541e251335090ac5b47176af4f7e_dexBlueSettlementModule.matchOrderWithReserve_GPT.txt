    There are no modifiers should be examined in function matchOrderWithReserve.
    Check direct function security
        - function dexBlueSettlementModule.matchOrderWithReserve(dexBlueStructs.Order,address,dexBlueStructs.ReserveTrade) has no security assurance protected by checking
        the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The given function does not contain any statements that check if the `msg.sender` is equal or not equal to an owner or specified address. There is no
          use of `msg.sender` or relevant checks in the function body.
        - function dexBlueSettlementModule.matchOrderWithReserve(dexBlueStructs.Order,address,dexBlueStructs.ReserveTrade) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing
        a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures. Although there are logical checks and variable assignments within the function, there is
          no 'require(xxx == True/False)' structure followed by 'xxx = False/True'. Additionally, there is no '!xxx' followed by a 'throw' or variable assignment
          structure present in the function.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['batchSettleTrades', 'settleReserveTrade']
        Function Security Analysis for dexBlueSettlementModule.batchSettleTrades(dexBlueStructs.OrderInputPacked[],dexBlueStructs.TradeInputPacked[])
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function batchSettleTrades.
            Check direct function security
                - function dexBlueSettlementModule.batchSettleTrades(dexBlueStructs.OrderInputPacked[],dexBlueStructs.TradeInputPacked[]) has no security assurance
                protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function contains a require statement with 'msg.sender', but it checks 'msg.sender' against the 'arbiters' mapping instead of
                  'xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO'. Therefore, it doesn't meet the specific characteristics: 'msg.sender == xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO'.
                - function dexBlueSettlementModule.batchSettleTrades(dexBlueStructs.OrderInputPacked[],dexBlueStructs.TradeInputPacked[]) has no apparent security
                assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The given function code does not contain any of the specified structures. It uses require statements but they do not align with any of the
                  mentioned patterns where a boolean change is based on a condition followed by at least one assignment operation within the relevant clause.
External Call Analysis

    Analyze Gas
        - address(this).call.gas(trade.gasLimit)(abi.encodePacked(dexBlue(address(0)).executeReserveTrade.selector,abi.encode(order.sellToken,trade.orderAmount-
        trade.reserveFee,order.buyToken,trade.reserveAmount-trade.reserveRebate,reserve))) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Here is the reason: The provided code is an
        empty list, which means there are no functions or values being assigned to the variable 'trade.gasLimit'. Without any assignments or calculations, it is
        impossible to evaluate the condition if 'trade.gasLimit' is always less than or equal to 3000. Hence, we cannot determine if the condition holds true or false
        based on the given information.
    Remaining external call:
    ['address(this).call.gas(trade.gasLimit)(abi.encodePacked(dexBlue(address(0)).executeReserveTrade.selector,abi.encode(order.sellToken,trade.orderAmount-
    trade.reserveFee,order.buyToken,trade.reserveAmount-trade.reserveRebate,reserve)))']

Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
