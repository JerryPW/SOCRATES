Function Security Analysis for FarmMain.withdrawLiquidity(uint256,uint256,bool,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function withdrawLiquidity.
    Check direct function security
        - function FarmMain.withdrawLiquidity(uint256,uint256,bool,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code contains a check on the ownership of the farming position which implies authorization by comparing `farmingPosition.uniqueOwner` with
          `msg.sender`. However, this does not precisely match the required structures that explicitly specify `xxxOwner`, `xxxAddress`, `Leader`, or `CEO` within the
          require or if statements. Therefore, it does not satisfy the criteria given for outputting 'Yes'.
        - function FarmMain.withdrawLiquidity(uint256,uint256,bool,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not satisfy any of the specified characteristics or structures. It contains 'require' checks, but they are not followed by
          assignments to the same variable in subsequent lines, as outlined in the required structures.

Function Security Analysis for FarmMain._burnFarmTokenAmount(uint256,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _burnFarmTokenAmount.
    Check direct function security
        - function FarmMain._burnFarmTokenAmount(uint256,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not include any explicit owner or address checks related to msg.sender. It lacks any require, if, or assert conditions that check
          whether msg.sender is or is not equal to xxxOwner or xxxAddress or a similar entity.
        - function FarmMain._burnFarmTokenAmount(uint256,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the required structures. It performs a token transfer and burns the token, without involving any require statements or
          variable reassignment that matches the specified patterns.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

        Function Security Analysis for FarmMain.withdrawLiquidity(uint256,uint256,bool,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function withdrawLiquidity.
            Check direct function security
                - function FarmMain.withdrawLiquidity(uint256,uint256,bool,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function uses 'require' statements to validate logic, but none of the conditions directly check if 'msg.sender' equals a specific
                  Owner/Address/Leader/CEO. Instead, it includes checks for 'farmingPosition.uniqueOwner == msg.sender', which does not fit the specified characteristics
                  given that 'uniqueOwner' is a property of 'farmingPosition'.
                - function FarmMain.withdrawLiquidity(uint256,uint256,bool,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The given function `withdrawLiquidity` does not demonstrate any of the required structures mentioned. It contains several `require` statements,
                  but they do not have a structure that involves setting the same variable to `True` or `False` after the `require` check.

            No The function 'init' does not have the same name as the contract 'FarmMain', nor is it explicitly named 'constructor'. It also does not hardcode the state
            variable '_farmTokenCollection', as the variable is assigned a value resulting from a function call ('IEthItemOrchestrator(orchestrator).createNative'). Thus,
            it satisfies neither of the characteristics.

                There are no modifiers should be examined in function init.
                Check direct function security
                    - function FarmMain.init(address,bytes,address,address,bytes) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                      Reason: The provided function does not check for msg.sender being equal to a specific owner, address, leader, or CEO.
                    - function FarmMain.init(address,bytes,address,address,bytes) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                      Reason: The code does not contain a structure where the same variable is both required to be true/false and then set to false/true as described in
                      any of the specified patterns.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
