Function Security Analysis for TokenERC20.investedbuy(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function investedbuy.
    Check direct function security
        - function TokenERC20.investedbuy(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The use of '_owner' in 'require(msg.sender != _owner);' is a local variable and not a specific identifier like 'xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO'. It
          doesn't match the specific conditions outlined in the characteristics for identification.
        - function TokenERC20.investedbuy(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures. There is only one `require` statement, `require(msg.sender != _owner);`, which doesn't
          fulfill the rules since it doesn't involve the boolean operation structures listed (with setting variables to true/false).
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['sender.send(amount)', 'a.send(msg.value*1/100)', 'a.send(msg.value*5/100)', 'a.send(msg.value*8/100)', 'a.send(msg.value*3/100)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - sender.send(amount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the '.send(' keyword,
        thus it satisfies the characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - a.send(msg.value*1/100) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the '.send('
        keyword, thus it satisfies the characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - a.send(msg.value*5/100) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the '.send('
        keyword, thus it satisfies the characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - a.send(msg.value*8/100) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the '.send('
        keyword, thus it satisfies the characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - a.send(msg.value*3/100) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the '.send('
        keyword, thus it satisfies the characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
