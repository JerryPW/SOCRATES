Function Security Analysis for Event.distribute()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function distribute.
    Check direct function security
        - function Event.distribute() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not have any checks on msg.sender or involve any ownership or address based conditions related to msg.sender. The provided code only has
          conditions related to the 'end' timestamp and 'totalClaps'.
        - function Event.distribute() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the structures mentioned in the criteria. It does have require statements, but they do not match the pattern
          specified in characteristics 1 to 4. The require statements in the code relate to external conditions based on timestamps and total claps rather than changing
          the state of any boolean variable as specified.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['attendees[i].call.value(reward)()']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - attendees[i].call.value(reward)() ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['attendees[i].call.value(reward)()']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['attendees'] should be checked in variable attendees
        Checked variables: attendees
            No The function 'register' in the provided code is not a constructor because its name is different from the contract name 'Event' and it is not explicitly
            named 'constructor'. It does not hardcode the 'attendees' state variable; rather, it adds entries to it dynamically at runtime based on function inputs such
            as '_attendee'.
            Function Security Analysis for Event.register(address,uint256)
                There are no modifiers should be examined in function register.
                Check direct function security
                    - function Event.register(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                      Reason: This code does not have any of the required structures involving msg.sender and owner/address/leader/CEO.
                    - function Event.register(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                      Reason: The code does not have any of the specified structures. Although it has requirements using require statements, none of them specifically
                      change the boolean state of a variable to its opposite state as outlined in the required patterns.
                Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
                The reachable functions are ['register']
                    Function Security Analysis for Event.register()
                        There are no modifiers should be examined in function register.
                        Check direct function security
                            - function Event.register() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                              Reason: The function does not contain any sender address check against a specified owner or leader address.
                            - function Event.register() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                              Reason: The function `register` does not contain any of the specified structures. It simply calls another function `register` with
                              `msg.sender` and `msg.value` as arguments. There are no uses of `require` statements, negations, or conditionals that meet the conditions
                              outlined.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
