Function Security Analysis for Dividends.fallback()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
    Check direct function security
        - function Dividends.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code checks if msg.sender is not an admin before executing the transfer logic and updating the 'users' mapping. However, it does not utilize any of
          the specific conditions featuring msg.sender as mentioned in the identified characteristics.
        - function Dividends.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code snippet does not contain any of the specified structures. There are no require statements or if-throw structures, nor does it have the
          specified sequence of variable assignments.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['tokenReward.balanceOf(user)', 'user.transfer(userether)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - user.transfer(userether) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains '.transfer('
        keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - tokenReward.balanceOf(user) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['tokenReward.balanceOf(user)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['tokenReward'] should be checked in variable tokenReward
        Checked variables: tokenReward
            Yes The function `Dividends` matches the contract name `Dividends`, which suggests that it is a constructor function. This is because in older versions of
            Solidity, constructor functions were named after the contract. Therefore, it satisfies the first characteristic.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
