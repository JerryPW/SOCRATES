External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['prices[tokenId].tokenOwner.transfer(msg.value)', 'erc721Address.transferFrom(prices[tokenId].tokenOwner,msg.sender,tokenId)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - prices[tokenId].tokenOwner.transfer(msg.value) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        'prices[tokenId].tokenOwner.transfer(msg.value)' contains the keyword '.transfer('.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - erc721Address.transferFrom(prices[tokenId].tokenOwner,msg.sender,tokenId) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['erc721Address.transferFrom(prices[tokenId].tokenOwner,msg.sender,tokenId)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['erc721Address'] should be checked in variable erc721Address
        Checked variables: erc721Address
            State variable erc721Address has initialized in public area after declaration.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
