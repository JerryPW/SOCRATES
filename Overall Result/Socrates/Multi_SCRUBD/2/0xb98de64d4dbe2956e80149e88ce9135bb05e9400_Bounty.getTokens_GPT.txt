            Yes The code provided is not a constructor because the contract name is "Bounty" but the function is named "Bounty", which matches the contract name
            suggesting it could be a constructor. However, this code does not use the "constructor" keyword, and it uses the old syntax style for constructors which
            matches the contract name exactly, so this can be considered as a constructor. But, the function does not hardcode the state variable "token" as it assigns it
            to a parameterized address, indicating it's set dynamically. Hence, the first characteristic is satisfied.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
