Function Security Analysis for AuctionContract.closeAuction()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function closeAuction.
    Check direct function security
        - function AuctionContract.closeAuction() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The assertion 'assert(msg.sender == winner);' checks that the caller is the 'winner', which is a local variable, and does not specifically match the
          required pattern of xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO as per the given rules.
        - function AuctionContract.closeAuction() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures involving 'require', 'if', or '!'.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['auctioneer.createAuctionContract.value(firstValue)()', 'auctioneer.createAuctionContract.value(secondValue)()', 'msg.sender.transfer(prize)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - msg.sender.transfer(prize) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call contains the '.transfer('
        keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - auctioneer.createAuctionContract.value(firstValue)() ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - auctioneer.createAuctionContract.value(secondValue)() ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['auctioneer.createAuctionContract.value(firstValue)()', 'auctioneer.createAuctionContract.value(secondValue)()']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['auctioneerAddress'] should be checked in variable auctioneer
        Checked variables: auctioneerAddress
            Yes 1. The function name is 'constructor', which matches the constructor keyword for Solidity contracts.  2. The state variable 'auctioneerAddress' is
            assigned using a parameter '_auctioneerAddress', which does not indicate hardcoding. Therefore, the function satisfies the first characteristic in the rules
            provided.
        There are ['auctioneerAddress'] should be checked in variable auctioneer
        Checked variables: auctioneerAddress
            Yes The function provided in the contract code has the same name as the contract, 'AuctionContract', and thus can be identified as a constructor function.
            Constructors in smart contracts are used to initialize the contract state when the contract is deployed, and they can set initial values for state variables.
            Therefore, the checked characteristic that this satisfies is being a constructor function.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
