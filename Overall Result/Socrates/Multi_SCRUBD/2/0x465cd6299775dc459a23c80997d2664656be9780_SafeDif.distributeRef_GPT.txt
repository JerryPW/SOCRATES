Function Security Analysis for SafeDif.distributeRef(uint256,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function distributeRef.
    Check direct function security
        - function SafeDif.distributeRef(uint256,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not include any checks or conditions related to msg.sender.
        - function SafeDif.distributeRef(uint256,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function does not include any of the specified statement structures involving 'require' or 'if' checks followed by variable assignments and
          subsequent optional assignments that match the patterns listed.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['invest', 'fallback']
        Function Security Analysis for SafeDif.invest(uint256,uint256)
            The modifier of function invest are ['isActivated']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier isActivated has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier isActivated checks whether the variable activated_ is set to true but does not enforce any restrictions based on the sender's
                  address (like checking if the sender is the owner) nor does it implement a lock mechanism. It does not use a naming convention that suggests it enforces
                  ownership or non-reentrancy either.
            Check direct function security
                - function SafeDif.invest(uint256,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures involving 'msg.sender' that checks for specific roles like Owner/Leader/CEO.
                - function SafeDif.invest(uint256,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The given code does not exhibit any of the required structures such as a variable being checked with 'require(xxx == True)' or 'require(xxx ==
                  False)', followed by modifying the same variable as specified in the patterns provided.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['player_[_affID1].addr.transfer(_aff)', 'player_[_affID2].addr.transfer(_aff)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - player_[_affID1].addr.transfer(_aff) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the
        '.transfer(' keyword, which satisfies the first characteristic outlined.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - player_[_affID2].addr.transfer(_aff) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the
        '.transfer(' keyword, which satisfies the first characteristic outlined.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
