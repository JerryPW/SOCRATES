    Analyze External Address
        There are ['mntToken'] should be checked in variable mntToken
        Checked variables: mntToken
            Yes 1. The provided code contains a function named 'FoundersVesting', which matches the contract name. This indicates that it is a constructor function.  2.
            The function does assign a value to the state variable 'mntToken', but it is not hardcoded; it is set using an external address '_mntTokenAddress'. Therefore,
            it does not satisfy the second characteristic. Since the code satisfies the first characteristic, the output is 'Yes'.
        There are ['mntToken'] should be checked in variable mntToken
        Checked variables: mntToken
            Yes The function FoundersVesting is a constructor because its name matches the contract name 'FoundersVesting'. This adheres to the first characteristic to be
            checked.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
