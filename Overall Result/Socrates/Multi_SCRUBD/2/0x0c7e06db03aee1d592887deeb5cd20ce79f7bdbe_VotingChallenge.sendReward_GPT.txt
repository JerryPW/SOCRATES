Function Security Analysis for VotingChallenge.sendReward(address)
    The modifier of function sendReward are ['afterVotingPeriod']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier afterVotingPeriod has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier checks if a specific condition (!isVotingPeriod) is met before executing the associated function. However, it does not check for ownership
          or specific addresses, nor it uses a lock operation to prevent reentry. Therefore, it does not satisfy any of the given characteristics.
    Check direct function security
        - function VotingChallenge.sendReward(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any checks involving the comparison of msg.sender and a specific owner, address, leader, or CEO role, nor does it use any of
          the identified patterns like 'require', 'if', or 'assert'.
        - function VotingChallenge.sendReward(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not match any of the specified structures as it lacks the 'require' or 'if(!xxx) throw;' statements that are required by the
          patterns to be checked.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['forwarder.forward.value(sum)(referrer2,to)', 'forwarder.forward.value(sum)(referrer1,to)', 'to.transfer(reward+voters[to].fullVotes[winner])']
    Analyze Transfer
        - to.transfer(reward+voters[to].fullVotes[winner]) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        contains '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - forwarder.forward.value(sum)(referrer2,to) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - forwarder.forward.value(sum)(referrer1,to) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['forwarder.forward.value(sum)(referrer2,to)', 'forwarder.forward.value(sum)(referrer1,to)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['forwarder'] should be checked in variable forwarder
        Checked variables: forwarder
            Yes The provided function is named 'constructor', which explicitly indicates that it is a constructor function in Solidity. Constructor functions are special
            functions that are executed once when a contract is created, and their function name is usually 'constructor' or matches the contract name. Thus, the external
            call satisfies at least one characteristic.
        There are ['forwarder'] should be checked in variable forwarder
        Checked variables: forwarder
            Yes The provided code is a constructor because the function is named 'constructor', which explicitly indicates it is a constructor function in Solidity
            contracts.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
