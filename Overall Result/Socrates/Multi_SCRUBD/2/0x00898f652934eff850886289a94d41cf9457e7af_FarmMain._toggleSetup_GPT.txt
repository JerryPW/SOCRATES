    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _toggleSetup.
    Check direct function security
        - function FarmMain._toggleSetup(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any checks or assertions regarding the identity of `msg.sender` relating to owner or address validations.
        - function FarmMain._toggleSetup(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified patterns that involve a specific variable being checked with require(...), then toggled between true
          and false, or vice versa. The require statement in the function checks a block number condition unrelated to the proposed patterns.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

                - function FarmMain._removeLiquidity(uint256,uint256,bool,uint256,bool) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not have any of the conditional checks or assertions involving `msg.sender` specified in the characteristics provided. It lacks
                  checks like require, if, or assert statements that compare `msg.sender` against an owner, address, leader, or CEO role.
                - function FarmMain._removeLiquidity(uint256,uint256,bool,uint256,bool) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any 'require' statement or 'if ... throw' pattern that matches the specified structures.

                    Check direct function security
                        - function FarmMain.withdrawLiquidity(uint256,uint256,bool,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures where msg.sender is directly compared to any fixed role like xxxOwner,
                          xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO. The comparison here is against a dynamically determined owner from the local variable, which does not satisfy the
                          conditions.
                        - function FarmMain.withdrawLiquidity(uint256,uint256,bool,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                          Reason: The code does not explicitly match any of the required structures. It uses the 'require' statement to check for conditions, but it does
                          not toggle a boolean variable from 'True' to 'False' or vice versa as required by the specified structures.

                          Reason: The code checks if the owner of the farming position or the holder of the farm token is the sender before allowing the withdrawal, but
                          doesn't explicitly use a condition like 'msg.sender == xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO' outside of or in addition to liquidity conditions within

        There are ['_extension'] should be checked in variable _extension

            Yes 1. The function name 'init' does not match the contract name 'FarmMain', nor is it named 'constructor'. Therefore, it is not a constructor function.  2.
            The function does hardcode the state variable '_extension' with the line 'require((_extension = extension) != address(0), "extension");'. Thus, it satisfies
            the condition of hardcoded assignment to a state variable.
        There are ['_extension'] should be checked in variable _extension
        Checked variables: _extension
            Yes The function 'init' does not match the contract name 'FarmMain' and there is no mention of it being a constructor. Furthermore, the state variable
            '_extension' is hardcoded within the function using the expression '(_extension = extension)', as '_extension' is directly assigned the incoming 'extension'
            parameter.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _ensureTransfer.
    Check direct function security
        - function FarmMain._ensureTransfer(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not check msg.sender against any specific address or role such as Owner, Address, Leader, or CEO using the specified structures.
        - function FarmMain._ensureTransfer(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures where a variable is checked with 'require' or 'if', then flipped, and optionally flipped
          again. It simply handles balances and checks without assigning boolean values. Hence the answer is 'No'.

                          Reason: The provided code does not use a direct comparison between 'msg.sender' and a contract-level owner or leader entity using the specified
                          structures. The check 'farmingPosition.uniqueOwner == msg.sender' is based on a local variable's property, which does not match the predefined
                          criteria.

                          Reason: The code contains require statements, but it does not follow the specific structures described. There are no statements like setting a
                          boolean variable to both True and False. Therefore, the function does not satisfy any of the given structures.

            2. The state variable '_extension' is assigned using the input parameter 'extension', i.e., '_extension = extension'. This indicates that its value comes from
