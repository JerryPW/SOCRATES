Function Security Analysis for RatScam.endRound(RSdatasets.EventReturns)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function endRound.
    Check direct function security
        - function RatScam.endRound(RSdatasets.EventReturns) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not have any condition that checks the identity of msg.sender against an owner or specific authorized roles. It simply executes without
          any privilege checks.
        - function RatScam.endRound(RSdatasets.EventReturns) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not have any require statements or any conditional logic throwing errors, nor does it have the specified variable reassignment sequences:
          require(xxx == True); xxx = False; or require(xxx == False); xxx = True; or require(!xxx); xxx = True; or if(!xxx) throw; xxx = true; . Thus none of the
          characteristics specified are present in the code.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['reLoadXid', 'buyCore', 'reLoadXname', 'buyXname', 'reLoadCore', 'buyXaddr', 'fallback', 'buyXid', 'reLoadXaddr', 'withdraw']
        Function Security Analysis for RatScam.reLoadXid(uint256,uint256)
            The modifier of function reLoadXid are ['isActivated', 'isHuman', 'isWithinLimits']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier isActivated has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier isActivated does not enforce that only the owner or specific addresses can execute the function, and it also does not use a lock
                  operation to ensure the function enters only once. It merely checks if a condition (activated_ == true) is met. Therefore, it does not satisfy any of
                  the specified characteristics.
                - modifier isHuman has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The code uses 'require(msg.sender == tx.origin);' in the modifier, which checks if the caller of the function is not a contract. However, it
                  doesn't involve any ownership checks, specific address checks, or lock mechanisms. Thus, none of the specified characteristics are satisfied.
                - modifier isWithinLimits has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier 'isWithinLimits' does not include any conditions or logic to enforce that only the owner or specific addresses can execute the
                  function nor does it include any lock mechanism to ensure the function enters only once.
            Check direct function security
                - function RatScam.reLoadXid(uint256,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code contains checks on input parameters and game conditions, but doesn't reference the `msg.sender` field in the context of checking
                  ownership or authority. It doesn't satisfy any of the specified patterns involving `msg.sender`, thus none of the required structures are present.
                - function RatScam.reLoadXid(uint256,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The given code does not contain any of the specified structures that involve a 'require' or 'if' statement along with corresponding variable
                  manipulations. It follows a conditional logic to handle affiliate code management but does not match the pattern described in the characteristics.
