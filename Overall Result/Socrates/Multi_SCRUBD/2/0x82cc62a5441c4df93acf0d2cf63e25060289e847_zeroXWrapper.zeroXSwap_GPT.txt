Function Security Analysis for zeroXWrapper.zeroXSwap(address,address,bytes)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function zeroXSwap.
    Check direct function security
        - function zeroXWrapper.zeroXSwap(address,address,bytes) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any require, if, or assert statements that check against msg.sender using the specified patterns.
        - function zeroXWrapper.zeroXSwap(address,address,bytes) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code snippet does not contain any 'require' or 'if' statements that check conditions followed by assignments to the same variable. It simply
          performs a call operation using the provided 'forwarder' address and emits an event with the result. Thus, it doesn't match any of the specified structures.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['forwarder.call.value(msg.value)(args)']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - forwarder.call.value(msg.value)(args) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['forwarder.call.value(msg.value)(args)']
    Analyze External Address
        The variable 'forwarder' in external call 'forwarder.call.value(msg.value)(args)' has no state variable assigned in zeroXWrapper.zeroXSwap(address,address,bytes).
        Therefore we check whether it has been hardcoded in the function.
            No In the provided code for the function `zeroXSwap`, the variable 'forwarder' is not hardcoded. It is passed as a parameter to the function, which means its
            value is determined at the time of the function call, not within the function itself.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
