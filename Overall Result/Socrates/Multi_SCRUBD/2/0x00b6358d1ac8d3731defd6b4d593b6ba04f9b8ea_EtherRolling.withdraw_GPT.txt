Function Security Analysis for EtherRolling.withdraw(uint8)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function withdraw.
    Check direct function security
        - function EtherRolling.withdraw(uint8) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures that involve checking if msg.sender is equal to or not equal to specified roles or
          addresses such as xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, CEO, or similar.
        - function EtherRolling.withdraw(uint8) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function `withdraw` does not follow any of the outlined patterns. There are no `require` statements checking a boolean variable with a subsequent
          assignment to change that variable, nor are there any `if(!variable) throw` constructions followed by a boolean assignment. Though there is a `require`
          statement, it simply checks if `to_payout > 0`, which doesn't fit the specified patterns.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['_token.send(msg.sender,to_payout,TokenWithdrawed)', 'address(msg.sender).transfer(to_payout)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - _token.send(msg.sender,to_payout,TokenWithdrawed) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 3.
        - address(msg.sender).transfer(to_payout) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains
        '.transfer(' keyword, satisfying the first characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - _token.send(msg.sender,to_payout,TokenWithdrawed) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['_token.send(msg.sender,to_payout,TokenWithdrawed)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['_token'] should be checked in variable _token
        Checked variables: _token
            Yes 1. The function provided is a constructor because it is explicitly named 'constructor'. Therefore, it satisfies one of the characteristics needed for an
            external call function.  2. The function also involves setting a state variable `_token` using a constructor argument, which is a common pattern for
            constructors. However, there is no evidence of hardcoding of the state variable '_token' in the sense of assigning a fixed value within the function itself
            without input from the caller.  Only the first characteristic of being a constructor is relevant here.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
