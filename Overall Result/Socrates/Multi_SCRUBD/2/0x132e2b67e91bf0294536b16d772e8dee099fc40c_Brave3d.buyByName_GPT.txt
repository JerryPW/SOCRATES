Function Security Analysis for Brave3d.buyByName(string)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function buyByName.
    Check direct function security
        - function Brave3d.buyByName(string) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not check msg.sender against any specific role like Owner, Leader, CEO, etc. It only checks and sets values using mappings.
        - function Brave3d.buyByName(string) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: After a detailed review of the code, it has been identified that the code segment contains the statement 'require(false);' but does not include the
          subsequent 'xxx = True;' statement necessary to fulfill the second characteristic structure entirely. Therefore, the two required components of the
          characteristic structure don't exist in tandem.

Start analyze function: Brave3d.overStage(uint8)
Function Security Analysis for Brave3d.overStage(uint8)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function overStage.
    Check direct function security
        - function Brave3d.overStage(uint8) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the required structures related to checking msg.sender against an owner or similar role.
        - function Brave3d.overStage(uint8) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does contain the structure where '!finishStage.isFinish' is asserted, and later on 'finishStage.isFinish = true;'. However, between these
          statements, significant logic is executed before the state is negated, including checks and multiple conditionals. This means the state negation does not occur
          immediately after the check but rather after processing the main logic of the function.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['setName', 'withdraw', 'forceOverStage', 'buyByName', 'buyByAddress', 'buyFromValue']
        Function Security Analysis for Brave3d.setName(string)
            The modifier of function setName are ['isExistsOfNameAddressMap', 'isExistsOfAddressNameMap']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier isExistsOfNameAddressMap has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: This modifier does not enforce owner or specific address execution, nor does it implement a lock. It checks if a mapping value is zero for a
                  given key.
                - modifier isExistsOfAddressNameMap has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier checks the length of the bytes of _addressNameMap[msg.sender] to ensure it is less than or equal to zero, but it does not enforce
                  ownership or specific address execution, nor does it use a lock mechanism. Additionally, the modifier's name does not suggest any ownership or non-
                  reentrancy enforcement.
            Check direct function security
                - function Brave3d.setName(string) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain any access control checks involving msg.sender compared to an Owner, Address, Leader, or CEO.
                - function Brave3d.setName(string) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code does not have any of the structures listed because it does not contain any 'require' or 'if' statement related to the
                  variables being checked and altered.
