Function Security Analysis for MoneyPrinter.distributeDividend(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function distributeDividend.
    Check direct function security
        - function MoneyPrinter.distributeDividend(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The provided code checks for shareholders' unpaid earnings and distributes dividends without having any authority check on msg.sender. It solely
          operates on the shareholder's data, verifying if there's any amount to be paid and distributing it accordingly.
        - function MoneyPrinter.distributeDividend(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function does not contain any 'require' or 'if(!xxx) throw;' statement related to a boolean variable, nor does it modify the boolean variable in the
          way described in the patterns. Therefore, it does not match any of the specified structures.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['setShare', 'goBrrr', 'process']
        Function Security Analysis for MoneyPrinter.setShare(address,uint256)
            The modifier of function setShare are ['onlyToken']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyToken is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The modifier 'onlyToken' contains the statement 'require(msg.sender == _token);', which ensures that only the address stored in '_token' can
                  execute the function. This directly matches rule 1, as it checks if 'msg.sender' is equal to a specific address, '_token'. There are no other structural
                  elements related to rule 2 (lock and unlock pattern) present in the provided code.
        Function Security Analysis for MoneyPrinter.goBrrr(address)
            The modifier of function goBrrr are ['onlyToken']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyToken is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The modifier onlyToken checks whether msg.sender is equal to _token, which ensures that only a specific address (_token) can execute the
                  function, satisfying characteristic 1. No structural omission was found as the entire code structure relevant to characteristic 1 was considered. There
                  are no indications of a lock operation present in the code, so characteristic 2 does not apply.
        Function Security Analysis for MoneyPrinter.process(uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function process.
            Check direct function security
                - function MoneyPrinter.process(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not include any require, if or assert statements checking that msg.sender is a specific owner, address, Leader, or CEO.
                - function MoneyPrinter.process(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided function doesn't include any of the specified patterns involving conditions on a variable followed by modifying the same variable.

        - IERC20(DigitalGold).transfer(shareholder,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - IERC20(DigitalGold).transfer(shareholder,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['IERC20(DigitalGold).transfer(shareholder,amount)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['DigitalGold'] should be checked in variable DigitalGold
        Checked variables: DigitalGold
            Yes The provided code contains a constructor function explicitly named 'constructor'. Within the constructor, the state variable 'DigitalGold' is hardcoded
            with the address '0x2260FAC5E5542a773Aa44fBCfeDf7C193bc2C599'. This satisfies the second characteristic outlined in the task.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
