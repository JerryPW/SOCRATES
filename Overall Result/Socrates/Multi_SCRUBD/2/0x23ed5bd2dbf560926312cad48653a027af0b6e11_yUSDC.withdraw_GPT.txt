Function Security Analysis for yUSDC.withdraw(uint256)
    The modifier of function withdraw are ['nonReentrant', 'noContract']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier nonReentrant has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: Upon reevaluation, the modifier employs a counter mechanism as a form of lock, intending to ensure reentrancy protection. The increment of
          '_guardCounter' at the beginning and the check with 'localCounter' using 'require' at the end is indicative of reentrancy protection. However, according to the
          precise requirement for structural match in characteristic 2, this code does not explicitly demonstrate both setting a lock variable to true and resetting it to
          false as outlined in the requirement. Thus, by strictly adhering to the described structure for characteristic 2, the initial judgment needs refinement.
        - modifier noContract has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier enforces a check using require to ensure that the sender is not a contract by calling isContract(msg.sender) == false. However, this does
          not ensure that only specific addresses or the owner can execute the function. It also does not use a lock operation mechanism nor hints any restriction by its
          name such as using 'Only' or 'nonReentrant'. Hence, it does not satisfy any characteristics for a 'Yes'.
    Check direct function security
        - function yUSDC.withdraw(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any direct check (require/assert/if) against msg.sender to ensure it is equal to owner-like or leader-like address.
        - function yUSDC.withdraw(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures: no require statement checks if a boolean variable is true or false before changing its
          state, nor does the function attempt to throw based on a boolean condition.

        Function Security Analysis for yUSDC.redeem(uint256)
            The modifier of function redeem are ['nonReentrant']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier nonReentrant is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: Rule 3: The modifier's name 'nonReentrant' suggests protection against reentrant calls (Rule 2). The code uses a counter mechanism to lock
                  (increment _guardCounter) and ensure it remains unchanged during execution (require statement), which acts as a lock operation. The unlock action is
                  implicit by checking the counter post-execution, fulfilling the lock operation's requirement without explicit reset as it's a counter-based strategy to
                  prevent reentrancy.
        Function Security Analysis for yUSDC.withdraw(uint256)
            The modifier of function withdraw are ['nonReentrant', 'noContract']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier nonReentrant is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: Upon re-evaluating the code, the modifier is named 'nonReentrant', following the naming convention that strongly suggests it intends to prevent
                  reentrancy. The code initializes and checks a counter to enforce the non-reentrancy lock mechanism. The '_guardCounter' is incremented to act as a lock
                  before the function logic, while the require statement checks for its consistency afterward to ensure it hasn't changed during execution. Therefore,
                  both lock and unlock parts of the mechanism are present, aligning with rule 2's criteria.

    Check direct function security
        - function yUSDC._withdrawAave(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not include any checks on msg.sender against xxxOwner/xxxAddress, nor does it have a decision-making structure involving msg.sender.
        - function yUSDC._withdrawAave(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not contain any of the specified structures such as 'require(xxx == True)' or 'if(!xxx) throw'. It is a simple function call to
          'redeem' without any checks or state changes like setting a variable to True/False after a require statement.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['redeem', 'deposit', '_withdrawSome', '_withdrawAll', 'rebalance', 'invest', 'withdraw']
        Function Security Analysis for yUSDC.redeem(uint256)
            The modifier of function redeem are ['nonReentrant']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier nonReentrant is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The code within the modifier uses a guard counter mechanism as a lock operation. It sets a counter before the function execution and checks it
                  afterward, ensuring the function executes only once at a time to prevent reentrancy. Both the increase of the counter before the function execution and
                  the check afterwards, effectively act similarly to the lock-unlock pattern described in characteristic 2. Therefore, the guard counter mechanism
                  fulfills the requirement for characteristic 2, ensuring the function is executed only once at a time.
        Function Security Analysis for yUSDC.deposit(uint256)

                - modifier nonReentrant is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The modifier uses a lock operation with `_guardCounter` where it increments at the beginning and checks consistently at the end of the function,
                  ensuring it has not changed. Both the 'lock' (increment operation) and 'unlock' (checking the consistency of the counter) operations are present, which
                  aligns with characteristic #2.

                          Reason: Upon reviewing the code again, the modifier 'nonReentrant' indeed matches rule 2 as it includes both the lock (by incrementing
                          _guardCounter) and unlock (by ensuring localCounter == _guardCounter) operations to prevent reentrancy, which ensures the function enters only
                          once at a time. This confirms the initial judgment was correct.

                    The result of checking modifiers:
                        - modifier nonReentrant is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                          Reason: Upon reviewing the modifier code, the lock mechanism is ensured by incrementing _guardCounter at the beginning and checking its value at
                          the end. This matches both the lock and unlock conditions required for rule 2.
        Function Security Analysis for yUSDC._withdrawAll()

            Check direct function security
                - function yUSDC._withdrawAll() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not include any require, if, or assert statements involving msg.sender.
                - function yUSDC._withdrawAll() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The function _withdrawAll does not have any logical structures similar to require(X == true), require(X == false), or !X conditional checks as
                  outlined in the criteria. It simply checks balances and triggers withdrawals if balances are greater than zero.

                        - modifier nonReentrant is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                          Reason: The modifier checks for reentrancy by using a counter mechanism to prevent nested calls, which equates to a lock operation. The
                          increment of _guardCounter before the function logic and the requirement that the localCounter equals _guardCounter after the logic together
                          ensure the lock and unlock mechanism of a reentrant guard.

                    The result of checking modifiers:
                        - modifier nonReentrant is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                          Reason: The provided modifier 'nonReentrant' uses a pattern to prevent reentrant calls by using a variable '_guardCounter' which is incremented
                          at the start and checked again at the end. The condition 'require(localCounter == _guardCounter)' ensures that the function cannot be re-
                          entered, which satisfies the lock operation requirement in characteristic 2 where state is preserved across function execution to prevent
                          reentrancy. Both the increment and check act as lock and unlock operations, respectively.

                - modifier nonReentrant is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The modifier's code structure aligns with rule 2 as it uses a lock and unlock mechanism by setting a counter to manage reentrancy prevention.
                  The '_guardCounter' is incremented at the start of the modifier, and a local copy is made before the function body. The 'require' statement checks if
                  the local counter equals the global '_guardCounter', ensuring that reentrancy doesn't occur. Both the lock operation (incrementing '_guardCounter') and
                  unlock operation (checking the counter against its prior state) are present, satisfying the complete confirmation for rule 2.

                          afterward to ensure no reentrant calls have altered the state. The presence of both a lock (increment) and unlock (require check) operation
                          confirms rule 2 is satisfied.
                Function Security Analysis for yUSDC.withdraw(uint256)
                    The modifier of function withdraw are ['nonReentrant', 'noContract']
                    The result of checking modifiers:
                        - modifier nonReentrant is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                          Reason: The function uses a counter-based locking mechanism where '_guardCounter' is incremented and then checked with a local copy to prevent
                          reentrancy. This acts as a locking operation and correctly resets, fulfilling both lock and unlock operations for the locking mechanism.
        Function Security Analysis for yUSDC._withdrawAll()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function _withdrawAll.
            Check direct function security
                - function yUSDC._withdrawAll() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain any conditionals or assertions checking msg.sender against Owner, xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO.
                - function yUSDC._withdrawAll() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any require or if statements related to checking or throwing exceptions based on a condition related to a boolean
                  variable, and it also does not modify any boolean variables to demonstrate any of the specific structural patterns provided.
            Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
            The reachable functions are ['redeem', 'deposit', 'rebalance', 'invest', 'withdraw']
                Function Security Analysis for yUSDC.redeem(uint256)
                    The modifier of function redeem are ['nonReentrant']
                    The result of checking modifiers:
                        - modifier nonReentrant is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                          Reason: Upon reevaluation, the nonReentrant modifier aligns with rule 2. It utilizes a counter _guardCounter increment to act as a lock before
                          function execution. The check require(localCounter == _guardCounter) acts as an unlock indicator after execution. Both lock (incrementing
                          _guardCounter) and unlock (ensuring the original state via require check) operations are present, fulfilling the complete criteria.
                Function Security Analysis for yUSDC.deposit(uint256)
                    The modifier of function deposit are ['nonReentrant', 'noContract']
                    The result of checking modifiers:
                        - modifier nonReentrant is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                          Reason: The modifier 'nonReentrant' indeed suggests that it is designed to prevent reentrant calls by its name. However, according to the
                          detailed rule (2), both lock and unlock operations must be identified within the code. In this provided code, there is an increment of
                          '_guardCounter' which acts as a lock, and then there is a requirement check after execution which serves as an unlock by verifying the state
                          wasn't corrupted by reentrant calls. Hence, both operations are present and correctly implemented based on rule (2).
