Function Security Analysis for MonkeyScam.endRound(LDdatasets.EventReturns)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function endRound.
    Check direct function security
        - function MonkeyScam.endRound(LDdatasets.EventReturns) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function endRound does not have any access control statements using msg.sender to check sender identity.
        - function MonkeyScam.endRound(LDdatasets.EventReturns) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code contains statements following the pattern of setting a variable based on a condition and then modifying the variable within an if block.
          Specifically, it has 'if (!address(monkeyKing).call.value(_com)())' and immediately afterwards uses '_gen = _gen.add(_com);' however, this structure doesn't
          match any of the specified patterns.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['buyCore', 'withdraw', 'reLoadXname', 'reLoadXid', 'buyXid', 'reLoadXaddr', 'reLoadCore', 'buyXname', 'buyXaddr', 'fallback']
        Function Security Analysis for MonkeyScam.buyCore(uint256,uint256,LDdatasets.EventReturns)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function buyCore.
            Check direct function security
                - function MonkeyScam.buyCore(uint256,uint256,LDdatasets.EventReturns) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any conditions or assertions that specifically check if 'msg.sender' is among certain roles such as Owner,
                  Address, Leader, or CEO. Therefore, it does not meet any of the specified characteristics.
                - function MonkeyScam.buyCore(uint256,uint256,LDdatasets.EventReturns) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not feature any of the specified structures requiring a variable condition (xxx) to toggle its boolean state between true and
                  false.
            Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
            The reachable functions are ['fallback', 'buyXid', 'buyXaddr', 'buyXname']
                Function Security Analysis for MonkeyScam.fallback()
                    The modifier of function fallback are ['isActivated', 'isHuman', 'isWithinLimits']
                    The result of checking modifiers:
                        - modifier isActivated has no relation with controlled by owner.
                          Reason: The modifier 'isActivated' does not explicitly enforce that only the owner or specific addresses can execute the function, nor does it
                          implement a lock mechanism. The check here is only for the 'activated_' state variable being true, which does not correspond to ownership
                          control or reentrancy protection.
                        - modifier isHuman has no relation with controlled by owner.
                          Reason: The modifier `isHuman` checks if the caller is not a smart contract by verifying that the code size of the caller's address is zero. It
                          does not necessarily enforce ownership or specific address restrictions, nor does it represent a typical lock operation or a name that suggests
                          restriction based on ownership or non-reentrancy.
                        - modifier isWithinLimits has no relation with controlled by owner.
                          Reason: The modifier checks for range constraints on the value of '_eth' and does not enforce owner or specific address restriction or lock
                          function for one-time execution. It does not meet conditions 1, 2, or 3.
                    Check direct function security
                        - function MonkeyScam.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures related to msg.sender restrictions or validations.
                        - function MonkeyScam.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                          Reason: The provided code does not exhibit any of the specified structures involving `require` statements or `if` conditionals that manipulate a
                          boolean variable as described in the given patterns.
