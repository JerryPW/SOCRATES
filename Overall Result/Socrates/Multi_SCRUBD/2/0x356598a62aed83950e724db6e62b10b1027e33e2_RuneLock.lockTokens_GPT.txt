Function Security Analysis for RuneLock.lockTokens(address,uint256,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function lockTokens.
    Check direct function security
        - function RuneLock.lockTokens(address,uint256,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not have any structures that compare `msg.sender` with `xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO`. It only checks for allowances, release times, and
          payment conditions.
        - function RuneLock.lockTokens(address,uint256,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not match any of the specified patterns. It contains require statements to validate conditions but does not modify a boolean
          variable based on these checks as described in structures 1-4.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['address(fee1Address).call{value:lockCost*98/100}()', 'address(fee2Address).call{value:lockCost*2/100}()',
    'token.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),_amountToLock)']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - address(fee1Address).call{value:lockCost*98/100}() ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - address(fee2Address).call{value:lockCost*2/100}() ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - token.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),_amountToLock) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['address(fee1Address).call{value:lockCost*98/100}()', 'address(fee2Address).call{value:lockCost*2/100}()',
    'token.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),_amountToLock)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['fee1Address'] should be checked in variable fee1Address
        Checked variables: fee1Address
            No 1. The function 'updateFeeAddress' does not match the contract name 'RuneLock' nor is it explicitly named 'constructor', therefore it is not a constructor.
            2. The function takes an external parameter '_newFeeAddress' which assigns a new value to the state variable 'fee1Address'. This means the state variable
            'fee1Address' is not hardcoded in the function.  Thus, none of the given characteristics are satisfied.
            Function Security Analysis for RuneLock.updateFeeAddress(address)
                The modifier of function updateFeeAddress are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: Upon re-evaluation, the code in the modifier includes a 'require' statement verifying if 'msg.sender' equals 'owner', which matches the
                      structure for enforcing ownership checks as per rule 1. There is no need for both lock and unlock operations since rule 2 is not applicable.
                      Therefore, the original judgment is confirmed to be correct without structural omissions.
        There are ['fee2Address'] should be checked in variable fee2Address
        Checked variables: fee2Address
            State variable fee2Address has initialized in public area after declaration.
        The variable 'token' in external call 'token.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),_amountToLock)' has no state variable assigned in
        RuneLock.lockTokens(address,uint256,uint256). Therefore we check whether it has been hardcoded in the function.
            No The variable '_tokenAddress' is not hardcoded in the function. It is passed as an argument to the function, allowing for any address to be used when the
            function is called.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
