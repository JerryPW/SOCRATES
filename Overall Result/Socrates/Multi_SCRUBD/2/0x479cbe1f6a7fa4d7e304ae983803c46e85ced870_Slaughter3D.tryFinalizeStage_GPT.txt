    There are no modifiers should be examined in function tryFinalizeStage.
    Check direct function security
        - function Slaughter3D.tryFinalizeStage() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not mention restricting access to the function based on the msg.sender address. No checks like require(msg.sender == xxx) or similar
          patterns exist in the code.
        - function Slaughter3D.tryFinalizeStage() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code matches the structure 3: 'require(!xxx); xxx = True;'. The negation operation 'stageToFinalize.finalized = true;' does not occur immediately
          after checking 'assert(!stageToFinalize.finalized);', instead, it happens after the main logic of the function executes. Therefore, the structure does not
          strictly meet the requirements.
