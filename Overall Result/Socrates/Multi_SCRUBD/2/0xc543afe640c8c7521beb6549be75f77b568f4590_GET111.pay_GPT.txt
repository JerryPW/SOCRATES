    There are no modifiers should be examined in function pay.
    Check direct function security
        - function GET111.pay() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code snippet does not include any checks for msg.sender against an owner or specified address using require, if, or assert statements as defined by
          the provided characteristics.
        - function GET111.pay() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given function does not contain any 'require' or 'if(!xxx) throw' statements matching the specified structures.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['fallback']
        Function Security Analysis for GET111.fallback()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
            Check direct function security
                - function GET111.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The given code does not check msg.sender against any specific owner, address, leader, or CEO. It only uses msg.sender to log the depositor's
                  address in the queue and send a fee. Thus, none of the outlined patterns are present.
                - function GET111.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code does not match any of the specified structures. Specifically, it does not have any 'require' statements that involve checking
                  a boolean variable and changing its value afterwards.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['dep.depositor.send(dep.expect)', 'dep.depositor.send(money)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - dep.depositor.send(dep.expect) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains '.send('
        keyword, satisfying the second characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - dep.depositor.send(money) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains '.send('
        keyword, satisfying the second characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
