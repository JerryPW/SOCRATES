Function Security Analysis for CharityMiner.deposit(uint8)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function deposit.
    Check direct function security
        - function CharityMiner.deposit(uint8) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified checks for msg.sender related to an owner, address, leader, or CEO in the required manner.
        - function CharityMiner.deposit(uint8) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code includes conditions like `require(msg.value > 100000 && !paused)`, but it does not follow any of the specific structures outlined in the
          instruction (like setting a require condition directly followed by variable assignment indicating state changes).
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['charityAddress.transfer(donation)', 'p3d.withdraw()', 'p3d.buy.value(purchase)(msg.sender)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - charityAddress.transfer(donation) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains
        '.transfer(' keyword, thus it satisfies the first characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - p3d.withdraw() ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - p3d.buy.value(purchase)(msg.sender) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['p3d.withdraw()', 'p3d.buy.value(purchase)(msg.sender)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['p3d'] should be checked in variable p3d
        Checked variables: p3d
            Yes The function defined in the provided code snippet is explicitly named 'constructor', which determines it as a constructor function by the rules given.
        There are ['p3d'] should be checked in variable p3d
        Checked variables: p3d
            Yes The code provided has a function named 'constructor', which directly matches the characteristic that determines whether a function is a constructor.
            According to the provided rules, this satisfies the characteristic of being a constructor function (characteristic 1). Thus, it qualifies under the given
            criteria.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: CharityMiner.myTokens()
Function Security Analysis for CharityMiner.myTokens()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function myTokens.
    Check direct function security
        - function CharityMiner.myTokens() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any access control mechanisms related to msg.sender and predefined roles like Owner, Address, Leader, or CEO.
        - function CharityMiner.myTokens() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code doesn't contain any require or if statements with the specified structure, nor does it contain variable assignments as per the required
          patterns.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['p3d.myTokens()']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - p3d.myTokens() ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['p3d.myTokens()']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['p3d'] should be checked in variable p3d
        Checked variables: p3d
            Yes The given code is a constructor because it matches the rule of having the function name match with the contract name 'CharityMiner' or being explicitly
            labeled as 'constructor'.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: CharityMiner.myDividends()
Function Security Analysis for CharityMiner.myDividends()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function myDividends.
    Check direct function security
        - function CharityMiner.myDividends() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not include checks or assertions involving 'msg.sender' with any owner or address roles as per the given characteristics.
        - function CharityMiner.myDividends() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures with 'require' or 'if' statements that include setting a variable to True or False.
          It is a simple function that calls another function 'p3d.myDividends(true)' and returns its result without using any of the specified patterns.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['p3d.myDividends(true)']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - p3d.myDividends(true) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['p3d.myDividends(true)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['p3d'] should be checked in variable p3d
        Checked variables: p3d
            Yes The provided code is a constructor for the contract named "CharityMiner". This can be determined because the function is explicitly named "constructor",
            which matches the characteristic #1 that meets the criteria.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
