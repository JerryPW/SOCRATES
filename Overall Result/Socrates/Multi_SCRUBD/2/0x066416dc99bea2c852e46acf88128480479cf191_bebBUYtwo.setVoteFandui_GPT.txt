    There are no modifiers should be examined in function setVoteFandui.
    Check direct function security
        - function bebBUYtwo.setVoteFandui() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures that check the identity of the sender against a predefined owner or specific address role.
        - function bebBUYtwo.setVoteFandui() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code structure matches Structure 2, where 'require(!_user.vote);' and '_user.vote = true;' are present. However, there are intervening lines of
          code, such as 'bebTokenTransferBET.transferFrom...', before the state is negated, which is not immediate. Thus, the structural requirements are not fully
          satisfied.

        Checked variables: bebTokenTransferBET
            No 1. The function name 'bebBUYtwo' matches the contract name 'bebBUYtwo', which indicates that this code could be a constructor function. 2. The state
            variable 'bebTokenTransferBET' is being directly assigned with the result of the function call 'tokenTransferBET(_BETadderss)', which is not hardcoded.
            Function Security Analysis for bebBUYtwo.bebBUYtwo(address,address,address,address)
                This is a constructor.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: bebBUYtwo.getTokenBalanceBET(address)
Function Security Analysis for bebBUYtwo.getTokenBalanceBET(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function getTokenBalanceBET.
    Check direct function security
        - function bebBUYtwo.getTokenBalanceBET(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any checks related to 'msg.sender', much less any that match the specified structures focusing on particular owner or leader
          addresses.
        - function bebBUYtwo.getTokenBalanceBET(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided function does not contain any of the specified structures. It is a simple function that returns the balance of a token for a given address
          and does not involve any conditional logic or variable assignments as described in the characteristics. Therefore, it does not meet any of the specified
          patterns.

        - bebTokenTransferBET.balanceOf(_addr) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['bebTokenTransferBET.balanceOf(_addr)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['bebTokenTransferBET'] should be checked in variable bebTokenTransferBET
        Checked variables: bebTokenTransferBET
            Yes The function 'bebBUYtwo' does not match the contract name 'bebBUYtwo' and is not explicitly named 'constructor', so it is not a constructor. It does,
            however, hardcode the state variable 'bebTokenTransferBET' with the value 'tokenTransferBET(_BETadderss)'. This satisfies the second characteristic.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
