Function Security Analysis for hayr._transfer(address,address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _transfer.
    Check direct function security
        - function hayr._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function contains a check using the pattern `if (msg.sender != pair && !inSwapAndLiquify && swapAndLiquifyEnabled && _balances[address(this)] >=
          swapThreshold){ swapBack(); }`, but none of the conditions '1, 2, 3, or 4' checks for `msg.sender != xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO` or its variations as
          listed. Hence, the function does not match any of the specified structures.
        - function hayr._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not utilize any of the structures specified in the task: it does not have a 'require' statement followed by modifying the same condition
          variable to false, or vice versa, or an 'if' statement for throwing conditions followed by changing the flag to true. It uses 'require' statements but these are
          unrelated to setting conditions flags as specified.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transfer', 'transferFrom']
        Function Security Analysis for hayr.transfer(address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transfer.
            Check direct function security
                - function hayr.transfer(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures that compare msg.sender to an owner or leader address.
                - function hayr.transfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The given code does not contain any of the identified structures with the 'require' or 'if' statement followed by a variable assignment as
                  specified.

        - hayReflections.setShare(sender,_balances[sender]) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - hayReflections.setShare(recipient,_balances[recipient]) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['hayReflections.setShare(sender,_balances[sender])', 'hayReflections.setShare(recipient,_balances[recipient])']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['hayReflections'] should be checked in variable hayReflections
        Checked variables: hayReflections
            Yes The function code provided is a constructor for the contract named 'hayr'. The function is explicitly named 'constructor', which matches one of the
            characteristics we are checking for. Therefore, the code satisfies one of the required characteristics due to it being a constructor.
        There are ['hayReflections'] should be checked in variable hayReflections
        Checked variables: hayReflections
            Yes The provided code is a constructor since the function name is 'constructor', which matches the typical pattern of defining a constructor in Solidity. Even
            though the state variable 'hayReflections' is mentioned in the constructor, it is being assigned a new instance of 'HayReflections', which does not signify
            hardcoding it in a way that affects the constructor determination. Thus, the primary characteristic satisfied here is that the function is a constructor.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: hayr.swapBack()
Function Security Analysis for hayr.swapBack()
    The modifier of function swapBack are ['lockTheSwap']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier lockTheSwap is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The code contains a lock operation where 'inSwapAndLiquify' is set to true at the beginning and reset to false at the end of the function block. Both
          lock and unlock operations are present.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
