Function Security Analysis for BitChordCrowdsale.update()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function update.
    Check direct function security
        - function BitChordCrowdsale.update() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any require, if throw, or assert statements involving the msg.sender attribute with an owner or similar role check.
        - function BitChordCrowdsale.update() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified patterns with the require or if statement. It performs an oraclize query and updates the oraclizeBalance,
          but it does not involve any require or if statement that checks a condition and then changes a boolean variable (xxx) as described in the specified patterns.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['__callback', '__callback']

            There are no modifiers should be examined in function __callback.
            Check direct function security
                - function BitChordCrowdsale.__callback(bytes32,string,bytes) has security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender, the function would
                not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The code includes 'require(msg.sender == oraclize_cbAddress());', where 'oraclize_cbAddress()' acts as a specific address against which
                  'msg.sender' is being compared. This matches the structure 'require(msg.sender == xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO);'.

                - function usingOraclize.__callback(bytes32,string) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain any require/assert statements or conditional checks involving msg.sender as specified in the rules.
                - function usingOraclize.__callback(bytes32,string) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code defines a `__callback` function, but it does not contain any statements or patterns that match the specified structures
                  involving a `require` statement or an `if-throw` pattern with subsequent variable assignments.

    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier oraclizeAPI has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier does not contain any owner/address checks or locking mechanisms. The name "oraclizeAPI" also does not imply ownership or a non-reentrance
          guarantee.

        - function usingOraclize.oraclize_getPrice(string) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any access control structures such as require, if-throw, or assert with msg.sender related to ownership or specific roles.
        - function usingOraclize.oraclize_getPrice(string) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function provided does not contain any of the structures that match the specified characteristics. There is no requirement or conditional check
          altering a boolean variable (xxx) as stipulated in the given criteria.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

            Check direct function security
                - function BitChordCrowdsale.__callback(bytes32,string,bytes) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The condition 'require(msg.sender == oraclize_cbAddress())' does not match any structure involving 'xxxOwner', 'xxxAddress', 'Leader', or 'CEO'.
                  It checks against 'oraclize_cbAddress()', which is not included in the specified roles or structures.
                - function BitChordCrowdsale.__callback(bytes32,string,bytes) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures. There is no 'require' statement followed by a reassignment of the same variable
                  as described in the allowed structures. The only 'require' statements present are for checking the 'msg.sender' and 'price', neither of which is
                  followed by a reassignment according to the specified patterns.

            Yes 1. The function name 'BitChordCrowdsale' matches the contract name 'BitChordCrowdsale', indicating it is a constructor. 2. The state variable 'oraclize'
            is being assigned values within the constructor, indicating it is being hardcoded in the constructor.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Function Security Analysis for usingOraclize.oraclize_query(uint256,string,string)
    The modifier of function oraclize_query are ['oraclizeAPI']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier oraclizeAPI has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The provided modifier checks and sets the oraclize environment variables and does not explicitly enforce sender restrictions or use typical lock
          mechanisms. The modifier's name, 'oraclizeAPI', does not infer any ownership or locking characteristics either.
    Check direct function security
        - function usingOraclize.oraclize_query(uint256,string,string) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any conditions or assertions using msg.sender, therefore it does not match any of the required structures.
        - function usingOraclize.oraclize_query(uint256,string,string) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures with 'require(xxx == True)', 'require(xxx == False)', 'require(!xxx)', or 'if(!xxx) throw'.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

                not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The code contains 'require(msg.sender == oraclize_cbAddress());', which matches structure 1 as it checks if msg.sender is equal to
                  oraclize_cbAddress, which is a specific address or entity comparable to xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.

                - function usingOraclize.__callback(bytes32,string) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The given code does not contain a 'require' or 'if(!xxx) throw' statement to match any of the required structures. It uses neither 'require' nor
                  conditional statements, nor does it manipulate the same variable that fits any of the provided patterns.

        There are ['oraclize'] should be checked in variable oraclize
        Checked variables: oraclize
            Yes 1. The function in the provided code is named 'BitChordCrowdsale', which matches the contract name 'BitChordCrowdsale'. This indicates that the function
            is a constructor.  2. There is no hardcoded 'oraclize' or 'oraclizeBalance' variable in the function, so it does not meet the second criterion based on your
            description.
        There are ['oraclize'] should be checked in variable oraclize
        Checked variables: oraclize
            Yes The code represents a function named 'BitChordCrowdsale' inside a smart contract also named 'BitChordCrowdsale'. This suggests that it's likely the
            constructor of the contract. There is no presence of the hardcoded state variable 'oraclize', it is used but not hardcoded as a state variable assignment or
            constant string/numeric value within the function.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
