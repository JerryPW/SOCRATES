    Analyze Transfer
        - msg.sender.transfer(change) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call contains '.transfer(' keyword
        (‘msg.sender.transfer(change)’).. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - _remunerationsQueue[i_scope_1]._address.transfer(_remunerationsQueue[i_scope_1]._amount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem.
        Here is the reason: The call contains '.transfer(' keyword (‘_remunerationsQueue[i_scope_1]._address.transfer(_remunerationsQueue[i_scope_1]._amount)’)..
        Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - _token.transfer(holder,tokenBalance) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - _remunerationsQueue[i]._address.transfer(amount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call contains
        '.transfer(' keyword (‘_remunerationsQueue[i]._address.transfer(amount)’).. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - _remunerationsQueue[i_scope_1]._address.transfer(amount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call
        contains '.transfer(' keyword (‘_remunerationsQueue[i_scope_1]._address.transfer(amount)’).. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - _token.transfer(holder,tokenAmount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - _remunerationsQueue[i]._address.transfer(_remunerationsQueue[i]._amount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the
        reason: The call contains '.transfer(' keyword (‘_remunerationsQueue[i]._address.transfer(_remunerationsQueue[i]._amount)’).. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - _token.transfer(holder,tokenBalance) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - _token.transfer(holder,tokenAmount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['_token.transfer(holder,tokenBalance)', '_token.transfer(holder,tokenAmount)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['_token'] should be checked in variable _token
        Checked variables: _token
            Yes The function provided is a constructor for the contract. The function is explicitly named 'constructor', which matches the second characteristic needed to
            satisfy the condition.
        There are ['_token'] should be checked in variable _token
        Checked variables: _token
            Yes The provided code is a constructor because it is explicitly named 'constructor'. In Solidity, constructors are special functions automatically executed
            during contract deployment, and they can be explicitly named 'constructor'. This matches characteristic 1 in the given criteria.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
