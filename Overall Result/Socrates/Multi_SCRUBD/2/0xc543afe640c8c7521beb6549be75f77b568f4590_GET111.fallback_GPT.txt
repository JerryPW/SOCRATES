Start analyze function: GET111.fallback()
Function Security Analysis for GET111.fallback()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
    Check direct function security
        - function GET111.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code snippet does not check msg.sender against any address named xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO or similar.
        - function GET111.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not conform to any of the specified structures. It does not perform any assignments to a variable 'xxx' after a 'require' or 'if'
          statement with 'xxx', as outlined in the criteria.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['ADMIN.send(admin)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - ADMIN.send(admin) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains '.send(' keyword..
        Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: GET111.pay()
Function Security Analysis for GET111.pay()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function pay.
    Check direct function security
        - function GET111.pay() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not have any of the specified access control structures involving msg.sender conditions.
        - function GET111.pay() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function provided does not contain any of the required structures involving variable manipulation combined with conditions using 'require' or
          'throw'. It mainly consists of a loop iterating over a queue, sending payments, and adjusting balances. It does not perform any logic specified in the
          characteristics.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['fallback']
        Function Security Analysis for GET111.fallback()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
            Check direct function security
                - function GET111.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain any structure that matches the given requirements. The checks in the code are only concerned with message value, gas,
                  and transferring ETH. There is no condition or assertion regarding msg.sender being equal to any specified owner, address or position such as Owner,
                  Leader, etc.
                - function GET111.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The given code does not contain any of the specified structures. There are no statements in the form of 'require(xxx == True);' or 'require(xxx
                  == False);' followed by a change in the state of 'xxx' in the specified ways. Similarly, there are no such statements with the 'throw'.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['dep.depositor.send(dep.expect)', 'dep.depositor.send(money)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - dep.depositor.send(dep.expect) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        'dep.depositor.send(dep.expect)' contains '.send(', which satisfies one of the conditions specified.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - dep.depositor.send(money) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        'dep.depositor.send(money)' contains '.send(', which satisfies one of the conditions specified.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
