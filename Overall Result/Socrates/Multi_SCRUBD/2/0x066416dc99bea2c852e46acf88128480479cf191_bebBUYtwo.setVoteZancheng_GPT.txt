Function Security Analysis for bebBUYtwo.setVoteZancheng()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function setVoteZancheng.
    Check direct function security
        - function bebBUYtwo.setVoteZancheng() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not include any checks on msg.sender against an owner, leader, or similar authority roles. It uses msg.sender for other checks, but
          they do not fall into the predefined categories of checking msg.sender equivalency to authority roles or throwing/asserting conditions.
        - function bebBUYtwo.setVoteZancheng() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The negation operation on '_user.vote' (changing from false to true) is not immediately performed after the 'require(!_user.vote)' check. There is some
          intervening logic before '_user.vote=true;' is executed, indicating the main logic of the function executes before this state change. Therefore, it does not
          satisfy the given restructure requirements related to immediate negation before main logic execution.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['bebTokenTransferBET.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),_value)', 'shenqingzhichu.transfer(shenqingAmount)',
    'bebTokenTransfer.transfer(shenqingzhichu,shenqingAmount)', 'bebTokenTransferUSDT.transfer(shenqingzhichu,shenqingAmount)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - shenqingzhichu.transfer(shenqingAmount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call is
        'shenqingzhichu.transfer(shenqingAmount)'. This contains the '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - bebTokenTransfer.transfer(shenqingzhichu,shenqingAmount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - bebTokenTransferUSDT.transfer(shenqingzhichu,shenqingAmount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - bebTokenTransferBET.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),_value) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - bebTokenTransfer.transfer(shenqingzhichu,shenqingAmount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - bebTokenTransferUSDT.transfer(shenqingzhichu,shenqingAmount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['bebTokenTransferBET.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),_value)', 'bebTokenTransfer.transfer(shenqingzhichu,shenqingAmount)',
    'bebTokenTransferUSDT.transfer(shenqingzhichu,shenqingAmount)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['bebTokenTransferBET'] should be checked in variable bebTokenTransferBET
        Checked variables: bebTokenTransferBET
            Yes The function 'bebBUYtwo' is not a constructor because its name does not match the contract name 'bebBUYtwo', nor is it named 'constructor'. However, the
            external call does hardcode the state variable 'bebTokenTransferBET' as it assigns it a value using a function call with explicitly provided parameters within
            the function body.
        There are ['bebTokenTransfer'] should be checked in variable bebTokenTransfer
        Checked variables: bebTokenTransfer
            Yes The external call function code provided is for a function named 'bebBUYtwo', which matches the contract name 'bebBUYtwo', indicating it is likely a
            constructor.
        There are ['bebTokenTransferUSDT'] should be checked in variable bebTokenTransferUSDT
        Checked variables: bebTokenTransferUSDT
            Yes The function name 'bebBUYtwo' matches the contract name 'bebBUYtwo', which indicates that it is a constructor function for the contract. However, the
            state variable 'bebTokenTransferUSDT' is not hardcoded within the function as it is assigned a value from an external call 'tokenTransferUSDT(_usdtadderss)',
            rather than a hardcoded value.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: bebBUYtwo.getTokenBalanceBET(address)
Function Security Analysis for bebBUYtwo.getTokenBalanceBET(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function getTokenBalanceBET.
    Check direct function security
        - function bebBUYtwo.getTokenBalanceBET(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not check any conditions on msg.sender and does not match any of the required structures.
        - function bebBUYtwo.getTokenBalanceBET(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not exhibit any of the specified structures relating to checking or assigning boolean variables as mentioned in the task.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['bebTokenTransferBET.balanceOf(_addr)']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - bebTokenTransferBET.balanceOf(_addr) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['bebTokenTransferBET.balanceOf(_addr)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['bebTokenTransferBET'] should be checked in variable bebTokenTransferBET
        Checked variables: bebTokenTransferBET
            Yes The function 'bebBUYtwo' does not match the contract name 'bebBUYtwo' and is not explicitly named 'constructor', fulfilling the first condition.
            Furthermore, inside the function, the state variable 'bebTokenTransferBET' is hardcoded with the value from '_BETadderss', satisfying the second condition.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
