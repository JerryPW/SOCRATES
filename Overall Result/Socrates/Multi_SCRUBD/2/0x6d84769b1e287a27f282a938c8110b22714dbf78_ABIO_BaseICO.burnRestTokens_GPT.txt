    Check direct function security
        - function ABIO_BaseICO.burnRestTokens() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function 'burnRestTokens' uses a 'require' statement to check the condition '!restTokensBurned'. It does not have any condition checking whether
          'msg.sender' is equal to an owner or specific address. Thus, the structure does not match any of the given criteria that involve 'msg.sender'.
        - function ABIO_BaseICO.burnRestTokens() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code satisfies the structure 3 pattern but the state change (negation) of 'restTokensBurned' does not happen immediately after the 'require'
          statement. Instead, it occurs after executing another function 'abioToken.burnMyBalance();'. Therefore, it does not fulfill the specific requirement of
          immediate state negation before the main logic execution.
