    Analyze External Address
        There are ['we_test_token'] should be checked in variable we_test_token
        Checked variables: we_test_token
            Yes 1. The function named 'VestingContractWTTEST' is the same as the contract name, indicating that it is the constructor function for the contract. This
            satisfies the first characteristic.
        There are ['we_test_token'] should be checked in variable we_test_token
        Checked variables: we_test_token
            Yes 1. The code defines a function `VestingContractWTTEST` which matches the contract name `VestingContractWTTEST`. Thus, this function is a constructor.  2.
            The state variable `we_test_token` is assigned the value `_we_test_token` passed as a parameter to the function, meaning it is not hardcoded within the
            function. Therefore, this characteristic does not match the hardcoded state variable requirement.  Since point 1 is satisfied, the output is 'Yes'.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
