Function Security Analysis for dexBlue.spendGasTokens(uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function spendGasTokens.
    Check direct function security
        - function dexBlue.spendGasTokens(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any checks involving msg.sender equality to roles like xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, CEO or the use of msg.sender in any
          require, if, or assert statements with such conditions.
        - function dexBlue.spendGasTokens(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the required structures with consistent variable states before and after assignment.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['settleReserveReserveTradeWithData', 'settleTrade', 'userSigWithdrawal', 'settleRingTrade', 'settleReserveReserveTrade',
    'batchSettleTrades', 'settleReserveTradeWithData', 'settleReserveTrade', 'settleRingTradeWithData']

            There are no modifiers should be examined in function settleReserveReserveTradeWithData.
            Check direct function security
                - function dexBlue.settleReserveReserveTradeWithData(dexBlueStructs.TradeInputPacked,bytes32[],bytes32[]) has no security assurance protected by checking
                the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not include any checks or statements that directly compare msg.sender against an explicitly named owner, address, leader, or
                  CEO. Hence, the provided structures in the prompt are not matched.
                - function dexBlue.settleReserveReserveTradeWithData(dexBlueStructs.TradeInputPacked,bytes32[],bytes32[]) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing
                a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code does not have the structures specified as there are no checks like `require(xxx == True)` or `require(!xxx)` followed by `xxx
                  = False;` or `xxx = True;`. The require statement checks for a condition without directly altering the state of a single variable in the pattern given.

        Checked variables: gas_token_nonce_tail
            No The function 'spendGasTokens' does not appear to be a constructor because its name does not match the contract name 'dexBlue' and it is not explicitly
            named 'constructor'. Additionally, the state variable 'gas_token_nonce_tail' is not hardcoded; instead, it is used as a part of an operation (i.e., it is
            assigned a new value based on a computation).

                There are no modifiers should be examined in function spendGasTokens.
                Check direct function security
                    - function dexBlue.spendGasTokens(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                      Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures that involve a check against 'msg.sender' to ensure it is equal to or different
                      from an owner or address role such as xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
                    - function dexBlue.spendGasTokens(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                      Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures. There is no 'require' or 'if(!xxx) throw' with subsequent variable
                      assignments as described in the structures.
                Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
                The reachable functions are ['settleReserveReserveTradeWithData', 'settleTrade', 'userSigWithdrawal', 'settleRingTrade', 'settleReserveReserveTrade',

                        There are no modifiers should be examined in function settleReserveReserveTradeWithData.
                        Check direct function security
                            - function dexBlue.settleReserveReserveTradeWithData(dexBlueStructs.TradeInputPacked,bytes32[],bytes32[]) has no security assurance protected
                            by checking the authority of msg.sender
                              Reason: The code checks if msg.sender is an arbiter but does not specifically check against xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
                            - function dexBlue.settleReserveReserveTradeWithData(dexBlueStructs.TradeInputPacked,bytes32[],bytes32[]) has no apparent security assurance
                            by utilizing a lock machinism.
                              Reason: The provided code does not satisfy any of the specified structures. There is no pattern of 'require(xxx == True)' followed by
                              setting 'xxx = False' or vice versa. Also, the pattern 'require(!xxx)' followed by 'xxx = True' is not present, nor is the pattern of an
                              'if(!xxx) throw' followed by 'xxx = true'. Thus, the code does not match any of the criteria provided.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
