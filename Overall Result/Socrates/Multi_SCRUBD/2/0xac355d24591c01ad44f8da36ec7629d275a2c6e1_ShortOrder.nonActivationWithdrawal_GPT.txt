    There are no modifiers should be examined in function nonActivationWithdrawal.
    Check direct function security
        - function ShortOrder.nonActivationWithdrawal(address[2],uint256[8],uint8,bytes32[2]) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not include any condition or assertion involving 'msg.sender' directly comparing it to an 'Owner', 'Address', 'Leader', or 'CEO'. It
          checks 'msg.sender' to transfer balance but does not compare 'msg.sender' to a specific address with any of the mentioned roles.
        - function ShortOrder.nonActivationWithdrawal(address[2],uint256[8],uint8,bytes32[2]) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures. It has a 'require' statement but it doesn't manipulate the boolean variable
          immediately afterwards as described in any of the patterns. The require statement is used with several conditions but none represent the exact form of setting
          followed by toggling a boolean.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['msg.sender.transfer(orderRecord[tokenUser[1]][orderHash].longBalance[msg.sender])']
    Analyze Transfer
        - msg.sender.transfer(orderRecord[tokenUser[1]][orderHash].longBalance[msg.sender]) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here
        is the reason: The external call contains the '.transfer(' keyword, which satisfies the first characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
