    Check direct function security
        - function EthTokenToSmthSwaps.createSwapTarget(bytes20,address,address,uint256,address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of
        msg.sender
          Reason: The code checks for msg.sender in require statements to validate swap conditions, but it doesn't relate to ownership or specific roles (e.g. Owner,
          Address, Leader, CEO).
        - function EthTokenToSmthSwaps.createSwapTarget(bytes20,address,address,uint256,address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function does not satisfy any of the specified structures. It uses require statements but these are not associated with setting a variable as True
          or False as described in the criteria. It does not change any variable to True or False following a conditional check as required by the specified patterns.

    Analyze Gas
        - ERC20(_token).transferFrom(msg.sender,this,_value) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['ERC20(_token).transferFrom(msg.sender,this,_value)']
    Analyze External Address
        The variable '_token' in external call 'ERC20(_token).transferFrom(msg.sender,this,_value)' has no state variable assigned in
        EthTokenToSmthSwaps.createSwapTarget(bytes20,address,address,uint256,address). Therefore we check whether it has been hardcoded in the function.
            No The variable '_token' is a parameter passed to the function and is used in creating a Swap object as well as a require statement. It is not set to a fixed
            value within the function, making it non-hardcoded.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
