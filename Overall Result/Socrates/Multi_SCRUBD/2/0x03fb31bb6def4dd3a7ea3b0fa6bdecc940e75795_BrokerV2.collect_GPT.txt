Function Security Analysis for BrokerV2.collect(uint256,address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function collect.
    Check direct function security
        - function BrokerV2.collect(uint256,address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not have any of the listed structures that involve checking if msg.sender equals or not equals to an owner or similar privileged
          address.
        - function BrokerV2.collect(uint256,address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon reevaluation, the initial check if (_auction.buyer == true) { does not constitute a 'require' condition. The necessary structural condition for
          'require(xxx == True);' where 'xxx = False;' follows it is not fully met. Both components should be present consecutively or clearly in the logical sequence.
          Therefore, there is a structural omission as the first part (require structure) is absent.

    Analyze Transfer
        - erc20Token.transfer(lastOwner2,lastOwner_funds) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - lastOwner2.transfer(lastOwner_funds) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        'lastOwner2.transfer(lastOwner_funds)' contains '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - erc20Token.transfer(creator,royality) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - creator.transfer(royality) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        'creator.transfer(royality)' contains '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - erc20Token.transfer(lastOwner2,lastOwner_funds) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - erc20Token.transfer(creator,royality) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - Token.safeTransferFrom(Token.ownerOf(tokenID),_auction.highestBidder,tokenID) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['erc20Token.transfer(lastOwner2,lastOwner_funds)', 'erc20Token.transfer(creator,royality)',

    Analyze External Address
        There are ['auctions'] should be checked in variable erc20Token
        Checked variables: auctions
            No The code provided does not define a constructor for the contract `BrokerV2`. None of the functions have the name `BrokerV2` or are explicitly named
            `constructor`.   Additionally, while the functions interact with the state variable `auctions` (e.g., `auction memory _auction =
            auctions[_mintableToken][tokenID];`), they don't have a hardcoded reference to the `auctions` variable.  Therefore, the functions do not satisfy the
            characteristics outlined for a 'Yes' response.
            Function Security Analysis for BrokerV2.bid(uint256,address,uint256)
                The modifier of function bid are ['onSaleOnly', 'activeAuction']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onSaleOnly has no relation with controlled by owner.
                      Reason: The modifier checks whether a token is open for sale but does not restrict execution to specific addresses or use a lock mechanism. There is
                      also no indication from the modifier's name that suggests ownership or lock mechanism enforcement.
                    - modifier activeAuction has no relation with controlled by owner.
                      Reason: The modifier 'activeAuction' doesn't clearly fit any of the defined rules. It checks for the auction's closing time but doesn't restrict
                      function execution to specific addresses or involve any lock operations. The function name neither directly implies any ownership or reentrancy
                      prevention, so no inference can be drawn based solely on the name.
                Check direct function security
                    - function BrokerV2.bid(uint256,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                      Reason: The function does not include any checks regarding the identity of `msg.sender` to determine ownership or address-based permissions like
                      xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO in any require, if, or assert statements.
                    - function BrokerV2.bid(uint256,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                      Reason: The code does not include any requirement checks for a variable that then going to be flipped within the same function, as described in any
                      of the patterns. It only contains several 'require' statements that check conditions related to value comparison or checks whether allowances match
                      the required conditions.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
