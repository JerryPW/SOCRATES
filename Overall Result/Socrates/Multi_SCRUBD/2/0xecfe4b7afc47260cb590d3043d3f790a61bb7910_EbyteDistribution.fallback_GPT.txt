Start analyze function: EbyteDistribution.fallback()
Function Security Analysis for EbyteDistribution.fallback()
    The modifier of function fallback are ['onlyWhitelist', 'isUnlocked']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier onlyWhitelist has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier onlyWhitelist checks if the msg.sender is not in a blacklist, but it does not enforce that only the owner or specific addresses can execute
          the function, nor does it use a lock operation or convey such through its name.
        - modifier isUnlocked has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: Upon re-evaluation, the code only contains a locking check (`require(!contractLocked)`) but does not have a corresponding unlock operation within the
          modifier, meaning it doesn't fully implement a lock mechanism as required by the second characteristic. Therefore, it doesn't meet the strict requirement for a
          lock operation according to the defined rule.
    Check direct function security
        - function EbyteDistribution.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures that check if 'msg.sender' is a particular owner, address, leader, or CEO. Instead, it uses
          'onlyWhitelist' which might be a modifier but does not directly contain any of the checks outlined in the conditions.
        - function EbyteDistribution.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not fit any of the specified patterns. There is no 'require' or 'if' statement ensuring a condition related to a variable with
          subsequent assignment to 'True' or 'False'.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['ebyteToken.transfer(investor,toGiveE)', 'ebyteToken.transfer(investor,toGiveT)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - ebyteToken.transfer(investor,toGiveE) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - ebyteToken.transfer(investor,toGiveT) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - ebyteToken.transfer(investor,toGiveE) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - ebyteToken.transfer(investor,toGiveT) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['ebyteToken.transfer(investor,toGiveE)', 'ebyteToken.transfer(investor,toGiveT)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['ebyteToken'] should be checked in variable ebyteToken
        Checked variables: ebyteToken
            Yes The function name 'EbyteDistribution' matches the contract name 'EbyteDistribution', which indicates it is a constructor. Constructors are recognized by
            having the same name as the contract in Solidity versions before 0.4.22, and explicitly named 'constructor' starting from Solidity 0.4.22.
        There are ['ebyteToken'] should be checked in variable ebyteToken
        Checked variables: ebyteToken
            Yes The provided code is a constructor because the function name 'EbyteDistribution' matches the contract name 'EbyteDistribution'. Constructors do not
            require hardcoded values for state variables to satisfy the given characteristics.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: EbyteDistribution.getTokenBalance(address)
Function Security Analysis for EbyteDistribution.getTokenBalance(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function getTokenBalance.
    Check direct function security
        - function EbyteDistribution.getTokenBalance(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any conditional statements checking against `msg.sender` for specific roles or addresses.
        - function EbyteDistribution.getTokenBalance(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given function does not contain any conditional statements or requirements using 'require'. It only retrieves the balance of an address from a token
          contract. Hence, it does not match any of the specified structures.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['ebyteToken.balanceOf(who)']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - ebyteToken.balanceOf(who) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['ebyteToken.balanceOf(who)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['ebyteToken'] should be checked in variable ebyteToken
        Checked variables: ebyteToken
            Yes The function 'EbyteDistribution' matches the contract name, indicating it is a constructor. Therefore, it satisfies the first characteristic.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
