Function Security Analysis for EasySmart.withdraw()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function withdraw.
    Check direct function security
        - function EasySmart.withdraw() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: No access control logic involving msg.sender and owner addresses/roles was identified in the code implementation.
        - function EasySmart.withdraw() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures as there is no requirement or conditional check that changes a boolean variable and then
          changes it back later in the function.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['fallback']

                  structures to qualify as a 'Yes'.
                - function EasySmart.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The given code does not contain any of the specified patterns. It does not have a 'require' statement or the specified combination of
                  assignments and condition checks related to a single boolean variable.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['sender.send(amount)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - sender.send(amount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the keyword
        '.send('.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
