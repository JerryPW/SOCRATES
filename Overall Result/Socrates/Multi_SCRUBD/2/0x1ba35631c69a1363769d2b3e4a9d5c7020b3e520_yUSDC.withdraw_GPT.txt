Function Security Analysis for yUSDC.withdraw(uint256)
    The modifier of function withdraw are ['nonReentrant', 'noContract']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier nonReentrant is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The code in the modifier uses a counter mechanism to prevent reentrant calls, which aligns with rule 2. The increment operation on '_guardCounter'
          before the function runs (acting as a lock) and the require check of the counter afterwards (ensuring it hasn't changed) acts as the unlock. Thus, both the lock
          and unlock operations are present.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
