    There are no modifiers should be examined in function determinePID.
    Check direct function security
        - function MonkeyScam.determinePID(LDdatasets.EventReturns) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures checking the msg.sender against an owner or controller like role (e.g. Leader, CEO). It checks
          if the msg.sender is associated with a certain player ID but no authorization based on ownership or control roles is implemented.
        - function MonkeyScam.determinePID(LDdatasets.EventReturns) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not match any of the outlined patterns in its structure. It does not contain a 'require' clause, nor does it manipulate a boolean
          variable following the specified patterns.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['buyXname', 'fallback', 'buyXaddr', 'buyXid']
        Function Security Analysis for MonkeyScam.buyXname(bytes32)
            The modifier of function buyXname are ['isActivated', 'isHuman', 'isWithinLimits']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier isActivated has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The code does not enforce specific sender restrictions or use a lock pattern, and the modifier name is not indicative of ownership or reentrancy
                  control features.
                - modifier isHuman has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: This modifier is named isHuman and checks if the message sender is not a smart contract by verifying that the code length of the address is
                  zero. Although it does not directly enforce owner or specific address checks, the function name is not directly related to Onlyxxx or nonReentrant, and
                  no lock mechanism is used, so it does not meet any of the specified characteristics directly. Therefore, the answer is No based on the given criteria.
                - modifier isWithinLimits has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The given modifier does not check the sender's address for owner-only access, nor does it implement a lock operation to prevent reentrancy. It
                  only enforces limits on a parameter value.
            Check direct function security
                - function MonkeyScam.buyXname(bytes32) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The provided code does not include any of the specified structures involving msg.sender as described in the characteristics list.
                - function MonkeyScam.buyXname(bytes32) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The given code does not contain any of the specified structures. It does not have any require statements with the specified conditions, nor does
                  it contain any if(!xxx) throw structure.
