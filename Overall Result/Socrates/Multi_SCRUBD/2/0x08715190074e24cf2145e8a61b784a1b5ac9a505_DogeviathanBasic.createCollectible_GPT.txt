Function Security Analysis for DogeviathanBasic.createCollectible()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function createCollectible.
    Check direct function security
        - function DogeviathanBasic.createCollectible() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code doesn't have a check for specific sender identity like requiring or asserting that msg.sender is a specific owner or leader.
        - function DogeviathanBasic.createCollectible() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not contain any structures where a variable is checked via 'require' or an 'if' statement and then flipped from True to False or
          vice versa using the structures specified.

Function Security Analysis for ERC721._safeMint(address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _safeMint.
    Check direct function security
        - function ERC721._safeMint(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified msg.sender checks for ownership or role.
        - function ERC721._safeMint(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any `require` or `if` statements that match the given function structures. It only contains a single line that calls
          another function `_safeMint` with parameters `to`, `tokenId`, and an empty string.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

            Check direct function security
                - function DogeviathanBasic.createCollectible() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function `createCollectible` does not contain any structures that assert specific ownership checks against `msg.sender`. It does not check
                  if `msg.sender` is equal to or not equal to any specific owner, address, leader, or CEO.
                - function DogeviathanBasic.createCollectible() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The given code does not contain any of the specified structures where a variable is required to be true or false and then modified accordingly.
                  The `require` statements in the code do not meet these conditions as they are not checking a boolean variable that's subsequently modified in the
                  specified manner.

Start analyze function: ERC721._checkOnERC721Received(address,address,uint256,bytes)
Function Security Analysis for ERC721._checkOnERC721Received(address,address,uint256,bytes)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _checkOnERC721Received.
    Check direct function security
        - function ERC721._checkOnERC721Received(address,address,uint256,bytes) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function _checkOnERC721Received does not check the identity of msg.sender against any specific owner or address, nor does it require or assert any
          conditions on msg.sender, hence it doesn't match any of the given structures.
        - function ERC721._checkOnERC721Received(address,address,uint256,bytes) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code doesn't have any of the required control structures or variable assignments specified in the patterns.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

            There are no modifiers should be examined in function safeTransferFrom.
            Check direct function security
                - function ERC721.safeTransferFrom(address,address,uint256,bytes) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The given code checks if the message sender is approved or is the owner using '_isApprovedOrOwner(_msgSender(), tokenId)'. It doesn't explicitly
                  check if the message sender is a specific owner or address like in the described structures.
                - function ERC721.safeTransferFrom(address,address,uint256,bytes) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code snippet does not match any of the specified structures. It contains a single 'require' statement and does not have
                  corresponding assignments to a variable as specified in any of the criteria.

    Analyze External Address
        The variable 'to' in external call 'to.functionCall(abi.encodeWithSelector(IERC721Receiver(to).onERC721Received.selector,_msgSender(),from,tokenId,_data),ERC721:t
        ransfertononERC721Receiverimplementer)' has no state variable assigned in ERC721._checkOnERC721Received(address,address,uint256,bytes). Considering that it is an
        internal/private function, we analyze the function inputs.
        Analyze External Address
            The variable 'to' in external call 'to' has no state variable assigned in ERC721._safeTransfer(address,address,uint256,bytes). Considering that it is an
            internal/private function, we analyze the function inputs.
            Analyze External Address
                The variable 'to' in external call 'to' has no state variable assigned in ERC721.safeTransferFrom(address,address,uint256,bytes). Therefore we check
                whether it has been hardcoded in the function.
                    No The variable 'to' is passed as an argument to the 'safeTransferFrom' function, and its value is not directly set or used as a constant within the
                    function. It is used in the '_safeTransfer' method, showing that it's not hardcoded.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
