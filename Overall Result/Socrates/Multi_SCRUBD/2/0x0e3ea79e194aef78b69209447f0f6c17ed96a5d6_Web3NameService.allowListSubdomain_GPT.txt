Function Security Analysis for Web3NameService.allowListSubdomain(string,string,bytes32[])
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function allowListSubdomain.
    Check direct function security
        - function Web3NameService.allowListSubdomain(string,string,bytes32[]) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain a condition that checks if msg.sender is equal to or not equal to a specific owner, address, leader, or CEO. The only
          checks involving msg.sender are related to Merkle proof verification and address-specific conditions like checking if the subdomain has already been claimed by
          the sender.
        - function Web3NameService.allowListSubdomain(string,string,bytes32[]) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code contains the structure 'require(subDomains_allowlistAddresses[pepe_name][msg.sender]!=true, "Claimed!");', which corresponds to structure 1.
          However, the negation operation of setting 'subDomains_allowlistAddresses[pepe_name][msg.sender]' to true happens after the main logic of the function, not
          immediately after the requirement check and before the main logic. Thus, the negation operation does not satisfy the required position.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['address(Ownership.addr).transfer(msg.value*(100-subdomains_fee)/100)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - address(Ownership.addr).transfer(msg.value*(100-subdomains_fee)/100) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason:
        The external call contains the '.transfer(' keyword, satisfying the first characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
