Function Security Analysis for Canvas.buy()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function buy.
    Check direct function security
        - function Canvas.buy() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any checks related to comparing `msg.sender` with an owner or specific address, such as require or assert statements, or
          conditional throws based on `msg.sender`. It only validates that the `msg.value` is equal to the `price` and the rest of the logic functions independently of
          who is calling the function.
        - function Canvas.buy() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not match any of the specified structures as it does not use Boolean variables with require statements or conditionally throws and
          modifies the Boolean variable as required.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['hodler.call{gas:20000,value:hodler_share}()']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - The gas limit in hodler.call{gas:20000,value:hodler_share}() is 20000, which is too high. Therefore, it will not prevent REE problem.
    Remaining external call: ['hodler.call{gas:20000,value:hodler_share}()']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['hodler'] should be checked in variable hodler
        Checked variables: hodler
            Yes The provided code snippet is not a constructor as the function name '_transferBase' does not match the contract name 'Canvas' and is not explicitly named
            'constructor'. However, the function has hardcoded the state variable 'hodler' by referencing it directly in the code with 'emit Transfer(hodler, to, 0);' and
            'hodler = to;'. This satisfies the second characteristic.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
