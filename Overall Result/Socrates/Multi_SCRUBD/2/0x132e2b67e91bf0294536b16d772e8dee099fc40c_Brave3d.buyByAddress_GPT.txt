Function Security Analysis for Brave3d.buyByAddress(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function buyByAddress.
    Check direct function security
        - function Brave3d.buyByAddress(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures such as checking if msg.sender is equal to or not equal to an
          xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO before executing critical commands.
        - function Brave3d.buyByAddress(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon reviewing the code again, the `require(false);` statement is present. However, to match structure 2, there must be both a `require(exampleVariable
          == False);` followed by `exampleVariable = True;`. This code only matches the `require(false);` and does not have the subsequent variable assignment statement.
          Thus, it does not fully conform to any of the defined structures.

Start analyze function: Brave3d.overStage(uint8)
Function Security Analysis for Brave3d.overStage(uint8)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function overStage.
    Check direct function security
        - function Brave3d.overStage(uint8) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not involve any checks regarding the identity of the sender (msg.sender) against a particular owner or leader address.
        - function Brave3d.overStage(uint8) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon reevaluation, the previous judgment was incorrect as not both required statements of the pattern were satisfied. The code segment includes
          `assert(!finishStage.isFinish);` but does not contain a secondary statement setting this variable to `true` immediately or conditioned upon further in the
          function scope. Thus, no structural pattern from the given options is fully matched.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

        Function Security Analysis for Brave3d.withdraw()
            The modifier of function withdraw are ['hasEarnings']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier hasEarnings has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier does not enforce ownership or specific addresses execution, nor does it implement a lock mechanism. It simply checks if msg.sender
                  has a value greater than 0 in the _valueMap. It doesn't satisfy any of the characteristics provided.
            Check direct function security
                - function Brave3d.withdraw() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures that involve checks against 'msg.sender' being equal or not equal to a certain
                  role/address (such as xxxOwner or Leader).
                - function Brave3d.withdraw() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures. There are no `require` statements or `throw` conditions checking a variable and then
                  modifying its value as described in the patterns.
