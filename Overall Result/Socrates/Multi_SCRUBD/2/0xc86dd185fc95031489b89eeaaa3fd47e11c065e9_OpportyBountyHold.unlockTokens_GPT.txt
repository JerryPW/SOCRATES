Function Security Analysis for OpportyBountyHold.unlockTokens()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function unlockTokens.
    Check direct function security
        - function OpportyBountyHold.unlockTokens() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any checks or assertions involving ownership or a specific address related to roles like Owner, Address, Leader, or CEO.
        - function OpportyBountyHold.unlockTokens() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon reviewing the code, the first two statements that match the structure 'require(!xxx); xxx = True;' do not perform the state negation immediately
          after checking the state. Instead, the main logic 'token.transfer(...)' is executed in between. Therefore, the structure does not satisfy the negation
          requirement.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['token.transfer(msg.sender,holderList[msg.sender].tokens)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - token.transfer(msg.sender,holderList[msg.sender].tokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - token.transfer(msg.sender,holderList[msg.sender].tokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['token.transfer(msg.sender,holderList[msg.sender].tokens)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            No The function provided is 'setToken', which is not a constructor because it doesn't match the contract name 'OpportyBountyHold' and isn't explicitly named
            'constructor'. Additionally, the function does not hardcode the state variable 'token'. Instead, it sets 'token' to a new value provided by the caller
            (parameter 'newToken'). Therefore, none of the given characteristics are satisfied.
            Function Security Analysis for OpportyBountyHold.setToken(address)
                The modifier of function setToken are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The modifier contains the statement require(msg.sender == owner);, which explicitly enforces that the function can only be executed by the
                      owner. There is no need to find multiple matching statements as rule 1 is satisfied by this single requirement. This structure is complete for rule
                      1 and no lock/unlock operations are involved for rule 2.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
