          assignments.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['msg.sender.transfer(weiAmount-weiExpense.mul(10**decimalDiff))', 'token.transfer(msg.sender,tokenBought)', 'token.balanceOf(address(this))']
    Analyze Transfer
        - msg.sender.transfer(weiAmount-weiExpense.mul(10**decimalDiff)) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The
        call contains the '.transfer(' keyword, which indicates it is a transfer operation.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - token.transfer(msg.sender,tokenBought) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - token.transfer(msg.sender,tokenBought) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - token.balanceOf(address(this)) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['token.transfer(msg.sender,tokenBought)', 'token.balanceOf(address(this))']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            Yes The code snippet represents a constructor as it is explicitly named 'constructor'. This satisfies the first characteristic to determine the output as
            'Yes'.
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            Yes The function name is 'constructor', which explicitly indicates that the provided code is a constructor.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
