    Check direct function security
        - function CUELauncherToken._doBurn(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not include any checks for the msg.sender against specific roles or addresses (like xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, CEO), nor any assert
          or throw statements that would restrict access based on msg.sender.
        - function CUELauncherToken._doBurn(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures. It doesn't use a require statement or an if statement that throws based on the
          condition of a boolean variable. Additionally, it doesn't change the value of a boolean variable after such a check.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

                - function CUELauncherToken.transfer(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not include any checks or constraints related to 'msg.sender' being compared to an xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO. It directly
                  performs a transfer action without such checks.
                - function CUELauncherToken.transfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code provided does not contain any of the specified structures involving 'require', 'if' conditions, or variable assignments as described in
                  the characteristics outlined. It is a simple function that calls another function and returns a boolean value, without the specified conditional
                  structures.

    Check direct function security
        - function CUELauncherToken._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The provided code does not match any of the defined structures for checking msg.sender against roles like Owner/Leader/CEO. There are no conditions or
          assertions involving msg.sender in this code.
        - function CUELauncherToken._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures. The code consists of various checks and conditions, but it does not involve changing
          the boolean state of a variable right after a require statement or handle boolean changes with a specific conditional throw pattern.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

            The modifier of function _doTokenomics are ['lockLiquidities']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier lockLiquidities is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The modifier sets a flag `_inLockLiquidities` to `true` before executing the function and resets it to `false` after, fulfilling the lock
                  operation requirements outlined in rule 2. No structural omissions are present as both lock and unlock operations are correctly implemented.

                - function CUELauncherToken._doBurn(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided function `_doBurn` does not contain any `require` or `if` statement. Thus, it does not meet the conditional structure as described

            explicitly named 'constructor', which matches one of the criteria for satisfying the characteristics. Also, the provided state variable 'uniswapV2Router' is
            hardcoded in this constructor. Therefore, the constructor meets both criteria: it is named 'constructor' and it initializes the 'uniswapV2Router' variable
            with a hardcoded value.
