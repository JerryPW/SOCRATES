Function Security Analysis for Town.remuneration(uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function remuneration.
    Check direct function security
        - function Town.remuneration(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not include any of the specified structures that explicitly check the identity of the msg.sender against a specific owner or address role.
        - function Town.remuneration(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function does not contain any statements that match the specified structures. It contains require statements, but they are not followed by changing
          the same variable from one boolean state to another within the scope of the function, as required by the template.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['_token.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),restOfTokens)', 'msg.sender.transfer(address(this).balance)',
    '_token.transferFrom(msg.sender,user,amount)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - msg.sender.transfer(address(this).balance) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        'msg.sender.transfer(address(this).balance)' contains the keyword '.transfer('. Hence, it satisfies the characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - _token.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),restOfTokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - _token.transferFrom(msg.sender,user,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['_token.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),restOfTokens)', '_token.transferFrom(msg.sender,user,amount)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['_token'] should be checked in variable _token
        Checked variables: _token
            Yes The provided code is clearly a constructor as it is explicitly named 'constructor'.
        There are ['_token'] should be checked in variable _token
        Checked variables: _token
            Yes 1. The function name is 'constructor', which explicitly identifies it as a constructor. 2. The state variable '_token' is assigned using input from the
            function arguments, not hardcoded.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
