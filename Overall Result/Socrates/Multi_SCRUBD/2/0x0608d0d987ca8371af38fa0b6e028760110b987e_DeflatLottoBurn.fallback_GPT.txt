Function Security Analysis for DeflatLottoBurn.fallback()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
    Check direct function security
        - function DeflatLottoBurn.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not include any statements that check for the identity of 'msg.sender' as per the specified patterns (e.g., checking if 'msg.sender'
          is or is not equal to a specific owner or address). It focuses on different conditions, such as the value of 'msg.value' or the length of 'playerPool', and
          performs actions based on those conditions without explicit identity checks of 'msg.sender'.
        - function DeflatLottoBurn.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not have any `require` statement checking a boolean variable followed by setting the same variable to `True` or `False`, nor does
          it have an `if` statement that throws an exception followed by setting the variable to true. It uses `require` to check an equality condition (checking
          `msg.value == quota`). Hence, it does not match any of the specified structures.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['tokenReward.transfer(burncontract,tokenReward.balanceOf(address(this)))', 'winner.send(amount)', 'tokenReward.balanceOf(address(this))',
    'maincontract.call.gas(200000).value(address(this).balance)()']
    Analyze Transfer
        - tokenReward.transfer(burncontract,tokenReward.balanceOf(address(this))) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - winner.send(amount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains '.send(' keyword in
        'winner.send(amount)'.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - tokenReward.transfer(burncontract,tokenReward.balanceOf(address(this))) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - tokenReward.balanceOf(address(this)) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - The gas limit in maincontract.call.gas(200000).value(address(this).balance)() is 200000, which is too high. Therefore, it will not prevent REE problem.
    Remaining external call: ['tokenReward.transfer(burncontract,tokenReward.balanceOf(address(this)))', 'tokenReward.balanceOf(address(this))',
    'maincontract.call.gas(200000).value(address(this).balance)()']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['tokenReward'] should be checked in variable tokenReward
        Checked variables: tokenReward
            State variable tokenReward has initialized in public area after declaration.
        There are ['tokenReward'] should be checked in variable tokenReward
        Checked variables: tokenReward
            State variable tokenReward has initialized in public area after declaration.
        There are ['maincontract'] should be checked in variable maincontract
        Checked variables: maincontract
            State variable maincontract has initialized in public area after declaration.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
