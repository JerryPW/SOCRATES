Function Security Analysis for Sargasso.tokenSend(address,uint256,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function tokenSend.
    Check direct function security
        - function Sargasso.tokenSend(address,uint256,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not include any of the required structures involving checking msg.sender against a predefined owner or address.
        - function Sargasso.tokenSend(address,uint256,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The first two lines that fit the structure do not immediately perform a state negation operation. After the initial 'require' of
          'secondaryUserLock[msg.sender] == false', several 'require' checks and changes to state (like modifying 'userSpecifiedTokenLock' and
          'totalTokensSpecifiedAddress') occur before 'secondaryUserLock[msg.sender]' is set to 'true'. This implies that the state change happens after some main logic
          execution.

    Analyze Transfer
        - selectedTokentoTumble.transfer(lookUP,userAmount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - buccTransfer.specialTransfer(userNum,0) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - buccTransfer.findUser(userNum) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - selectedTokentoTumble.transfer(lookUP,userAmount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - buccTransfer.specialTransfer(userNum,0) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['buccTransfer.findUser(userNum)', 'selectedTokentoTumble.transfer(lookUP,userAmount)', 'buccTransfer.specialTransfer(userNum,0)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['v2Address'] should be checked in variable buccTransfer
        Checked variables: v2Address
            Yes The code includes a constructor function named 'constructor', which matches the second rule for determining constructors. Additionally, the state variable
            'v2Address' is included in the constructor parameters and initialized within the constructor, but there is no hardcoding of the 'v2Address' since it relies on
            input parameters.
        There are ['selectedTokentoTumble'] should be checked in variable selectedTokentoTumble
        Checked variables: selectedTokentoTumble
            Yes The function 'tokenSend' and 'preApproveTokens' contain the statement 'selectedTokentoTumble = tokenTumble(specifiedToken);', which modifies the provided
            state variable 'selectedTokentoTumble'. Therefore, the functions satisfy the second characteristic where the function has hardcoded the provided state
            variable.
        There are ['v2Address'] should be checked in variable buccTransfer
        Checked variables: v2Address
            Yes The constructor function explicitly takes '_v2Address' as a parameter and assigns it to 'v2Address', so it is not hardcoded. The given code includes a
            constructor explicitly named, conforming to the rule that a constructor is either named constructor or has a name matching the contract name. Therefore, the
            code matches the first characteristic of being a constructor.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
