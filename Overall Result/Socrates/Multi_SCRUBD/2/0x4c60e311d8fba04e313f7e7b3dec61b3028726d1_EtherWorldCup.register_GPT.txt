Function Security Analysis for EtherWorldCup.register()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function register.
    Check direct function security
        - function EtherWorldCup.register() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not check if msg.sender is an Owner/Address/Leader/CEO or similar.
        - function EtherWorldCup.register() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon reevaluating the code, the relevant structure requires both a 'require' statement and a subsequent assignment to a boolean. The initial 'require'
          statement is 'require(!playerRegistered[_customerAddress])', which checks that the player is not registered. However, the code lacks a direct assignment of
          'playerRegistered[_customerAddress] = true;' immediately following this check. While 'playerRegistered[_customerAddress] = true;' does exist in the code, it is
          unconnected in sequence to the initial 'require'. Therefore, the conditions for characteristic 3 are not met as per guidelines.  Additionally, the second
          'require(playerRegistered[_customerAddress])' is unrelated to the '// Structure 3' context as it's used as a validation after registration.  Upon careful
          inspection, no contiguous sequence in the code matches any prescribed structure wholly, thus the correct response is
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['administrator.send(fivePercent)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - administrator.send(fivePercent) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains '.send('
        keyword, which satisfies the determined characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
