Function Security Analysis for ShortOrder.tokenFulfillmentDeposit(address[2],uint256,uint256[8],uint8,bytes32[2])
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function tokenFulfillmentDeposit.
    Check direct function security
        - function ShortOrder.tokenFulfillmentDeposit(address[2],uint256,uint256[8],uint8,bytes32[2]) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of
        msg.sender
          Reason: The provided function does not include any condition that checks if `msg.sender` is equal to or not equal to any owner, address, leader, or CEO. It
          focuses on verifying a signature, block conditions, and order records instead.
        - function ShortOrder.tokenFulfillmentDeposit(address[2],uint256,uint256[8],uint8,bytes32[2]) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The structure 'require(!xxx); xxx = true;' is found in the code. However, the negation of xxx, which is 'orderRecord[msg.sender][orderHash].tokenDeposit
          = true;', occurs after the main logic of checking conditions and transferring tokens, not immediately after the requirement. Thus, the state change is not
          conducted immediately post-requirement.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['Token(tokenUser[0]).transferFrom(msg.sender,this,amount)']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - Token(tokenUser[0]).transferFrom(msg.sender,this,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['Token(tokenUser[0]).transferFrom(msg.sender,this,amount)']
    Analyze External Address
        The variable 'tokenUser' in external call 'Token(tokenUser[0]).transferFrom(msg.sender,this,amount)' has no state variable assigned in
        ShortOrder.tokenFulfillmentDeposit(address[2],uint256,uint256[8],uint8,bytes32[2]). Therefore we check whether it has been hardcoded in the function.
            No The variable 'tokenUser' is used within the function as part of operations on inputs, checking conditions, and modifying records based on external inputs;
            it is not assigned a fixed or hardcoded value anywhere within the function body. The value of 'tokenUser' is fully dependent on what is passed into the
            function as an argument during its execution.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
