Function Security Analysis for DesTokenSale.doPurchase(address)
    The modifier of function doPurchase are ['stopInEmergency']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier stopInEmergency has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier 'stopInEmergency' is checking a condition 'require(!halted);' which prevents execution during an emergency, inferred from the name and
          behavior. However, it does not specifically enforce execution restriction to an owner or specific addresses nor use lock operations to prevent multiple entries.
          Hence, it does not satisfy any of the listed characteristics.
    Check direct function security
        - function DesTokenSale.doPurchase(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any condition that checks msg.sender equivalence or negation against any xxOwner/xxAddress/Leader/CEO variable using require,
          if, or assert statements as described in the checklist.
        - function DesTokenSale.doPurchase(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code snippet does not contain any of the specified structures where a variable's truth value is checked and then changed shortly thereafter
          according to the structural requirements.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['fallback', 'doPurchaseFor']
        Function Security Analysis for DesTokenSale.fallback()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
            Check direct function security
                - function DesTokenSale.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified characteristics related to checking the sender's address against an owner, address, leader,
                  or CEO.
                - function DesTokenSale.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The given function doesn't match any of the specified structures. There are no require statements or condition checks that involve assigning a
                  boolean value to a variable as described in any of the characteristic structures.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['token.balanceOf(_sender)', 'token.balanceOf(_sender).add(tokens)', 'token.transfer(_sender,tokens)', 'beneficiary.transfer(msg.value)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - token.transfer(_sender,tokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - beneficiary.transfer(msg.value) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        'beneficiary.transfer(msg.value)' contains '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - token.balanceOf(_sender) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - token.balanceOf(_sender).add(tokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - token.transfer(_sender,tokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['token.balanceOf(_sender)', 'token.balanceOf(_sender).add(tokens)', 'token.transfer(_sender,tokens)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            Yes The function 'DesTokenSale' matches the contract name 'DesTokenSale', indicating that this function is a constructor.  Additionally, the external call
            function sets the state variable 'token' using the parameter '_token', but there is no hardcoded value provided for 'token'. Therefore, only the first
            characteristic is satisfied.
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            Yes The provided code is the constructor for the DesTokenSale contract. The function name 'DesTokenSale' matches the contract name, indicating that it
            initializes the state when the contract is deployed. The state variable 'token' is set using the external input '_token' and is not hardcoded, so the second
            characteristic is not met. However, the first characteristic is satisfied because the code provided is for a constructor function.
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            Yes The provided code is a constructor since the function name matches the contract name (DesTokenSale). Constructors are executed only once when the contract
            is deployed, and they usually set initial state variables. In this case, the function sets the state variables 'token' and 'beneficiary'. The presence of
            "DesTokenSale" as a function name which matches the contract name indicates it's the constructor.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
