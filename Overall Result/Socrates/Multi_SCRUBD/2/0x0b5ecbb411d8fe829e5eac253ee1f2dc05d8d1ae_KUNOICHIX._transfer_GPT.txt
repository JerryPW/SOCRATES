Function Security Analysis for KUNOICHIX._transfer(address,address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _transfer.
    Check direct function security
        - function KUNOICHIX._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any condition where 'msg.sender' is compared against an owner or other high privilege address or thrown as an
          error/requirement.
        - function KUNOICHIX._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not match any of the required structures. Specifically, it doesn't include any 'require(xxx == True)' or 'require(xxx == False)' or
          'require(!xxx)' assertions that are immediately followed by a statement which directly modifies that same variable like 'xxx = False' or 'xxx = True'.
          Additionally, it doesn't have any 'if(!xxx) throw;' constructs. It mostly involves checks with 'require' but doesn't alter the variable checked with 'require'
          in the manner stipulated.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transfer', 'transferFrom']
        Function Security Analysis for KUNOICHIX.transfer(address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transfer.
            Check direct function security
                - function KUNOICHIX.transfer(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function `transfer` does not contain a check for `msg.sender` being equal to an owner, address, or role like Leader/CEO. It simply calls
                  `_transfer` with `_msgSender()` which is a common pattern but does not fit the specified structures.
                - function KUNOICHIX.transfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code defines a function `transfer` that calls an internal function `_transfer` with specified sender, recipient, and amount
                  arguments. It does not contain any 'require' or 'if' statements with a specific variable being checked and then reassigned, which are needed to match
                  one of the defined structures.

Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: KUNOICHIX.swapBack()
Function Security Analysis for KUNOICHIX.swapBack()
    The modifier of function swapBack are ['lockTheSwap']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier lockTheSwap is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The modifier 'lockTheSwap' sets 'inSwapAndLiquify' to true before the function runs and resets it to false afterward. This matches the full lock and
          unlock structure required for rule 2.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
