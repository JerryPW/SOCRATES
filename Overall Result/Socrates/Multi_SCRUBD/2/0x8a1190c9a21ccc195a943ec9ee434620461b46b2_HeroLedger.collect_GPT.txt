Function Security Analysis for HeroLedger.collect(uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function collect.
    Check direct function security
        - function HeroLedger.collect(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code doesn't have any checks or require/assert statements that verify whether msg.sender is equal to an owner or leadership role like xxxOwner,
          xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO. There are no conditions checking msg.sender directly against any specific owner/address.
        - function HeroLedger.collect(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures like 'require(xxx == True); xxx = False;' or 'require(xxx == False); xxx = True;'. It only has
          a single require statement and does not modify the variable inside the require with a booleans assignment after.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['erc20.transfer(msg.sender,amount)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - erc20.transfer(msg.sender,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - erc20.transfer(msg.sender,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['erc20.transfer(msg.sender,amount)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['erc20'] should be checked in variable erc20
        Checked variables: erc20
            No The function provided is named 'setERC20Address', which does not match the contract name 'HeroLedger', and it is not explicitly named 'constructor'.
            Therefore, it is not a constructor function. The state variable 'erc20' is assigned a value within the function; however, this value is derived from the input
            parameter '_address' and from interaction with the candidateContract, meaning it is not hardcoded or containing a fixed value in the code. Thus, the
            conditions are not satisfied, and I will output 'No'.
            Function Security Analysis for HeroLedger.setERC20Address(address,uint256,uint256)
                The modifier of function setERC20Address are ['onlyLeader']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyLeader is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The code contains a require statement 'require(msg.sender == leaderAddress)' which enforces that only a specific address (leaderAddress) can
                      execute the function. This satisfies rule 1, ensure that only specific addresses can execute the function.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
