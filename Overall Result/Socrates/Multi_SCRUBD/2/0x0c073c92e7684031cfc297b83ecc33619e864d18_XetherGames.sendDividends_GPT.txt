            No 1. The function is not a constructor because its name does not match the contract name 'XetherGames' nor is it explicitly named 'constructor'. 2. The
            function does not hardcode the state variable 'xEtherTokensContract'. It sets the variable using a parameter 'xEtherContract', which means it is determined at
            runtime rather than hardcoded.
            Function Security Analysis for XetherGames.setXEtherContract(address)
                The modifier of function setXEtherContract are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The modifier contains the statement `require(msg.sender == owner, "OnlyOwner methods called by non-owner.");`, which aligns with
                      characteristic 1, ensuring only the owner can execute the function. This confirms that at least one matching statement exists without omissions.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
