Function Security Analysis for UnicornToken._disperseEth()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _disperseEth.
    Check direct function security
        - function UnicornToken._disperseEth() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The provided function does not contain any of the required structures involving restrictions or conditions on msg.sender with respect to ownership or
          specific addresses. The function operates on the contract's ETH balance and transfers funds to a specified address, without any condition related to msg.sender.
        - function UnicornToken._disperseEth() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not contain any of the specified structures. It uses simple conditional checks and assignments without any 'require' or 'throw'
          logic for a specific variable 'xxx' followed by subsequent assignments to 'xxx'.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['_tax', 'transfer', 'transferFrom', '_transfer']
        Function Security Analysis for UnicornToken._tax(address)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function _tax.
            Check direct function security
                - function UnicornToken._tax(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified conditions related to `msg.sender`. It does not check if `msg.sender` is equal to or not equal to
                  any defined roles or addresses such as Owner, Address, Leader, or CEO.
                - function UnicornToken._tax(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The given code does not include any of the specified structures that involve a 'require' statement or an 'if (!xxx) throw' statement linked with
                  setting a variable to 'True' or 'False'. Thus, it does not match any of the provided patterns.
            Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
            The reachable functions are ['transfer', 'transferFrom', '_transfer']
                Function Security Analysis for UnicornToken.transfer(address,uint256)
                    There are no modifiers should be examined in function transfer.
                    Check direct function security
                        - function UnicornToken.transfer(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                          Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures related to 'msg.sender' comparison with xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
                        - function UnicornToken.transfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures where a boolean variable is checked, modified, and potentially
                          reassigned. The code is a simple function to transfer a specified amount to a recipient, with no boolean variables or conditional checks.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['m_EthReflectSvcAddress.transfer(m_EthReflectAmount)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - m_EthReflectSvcAddress.transfer(m_EthReflectAmount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external
        call contains the keyword '.transfer('.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Function Security Analysis for Taxable.payTaxes(uint256,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function payTaxes.
    Check direct function security
        - function Taxable.payTaxes(uint256,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The provided function does not include any checks or conditions involving 'msg.sender' and any of the specified owner/leader roles. It solely focuses on
          tax allocation and transfer without permission verification logic.
        - function Taxable.payTaxes(uint256,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not include any of the specified structures, such as require statements or conditional throw statements in conjunction with boolean
          variable updates.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['_tax', '_disperseEth', 'transfer', 'transferFrom', '_transfer']
        Function Security Analysis for UnicornToken._tax(address)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function _tax.
            Check direct function security
                - function UnicornToken._tax(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain any condition checking the msg.sender for equality or inequality with an owner-like address or role such as
                  xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
                - function UnicornToken._tax(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified patterns: it has neither a require statement nor an if statement followed by a throw or require
                  style logic according to the conditions defined.
            Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

                    There are no modifiers should be examined in function transfer.
                    Check direct function security
                        - function UnicornToken.transfer(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                          Reason: The provided code does not contain any conditional statements or assertions that check msg.sender against an owner or specific address
                          (Owner/Address/Leader/CEO). The function simply transfers tokens from the sender to the recipient.
                        - function UnicornToken.transfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                          Reason: The given code snippet does not contain any instance of 'require(xxx == True)', 'require(xxx == False)', 'require(!xxx)', or 'if(!xxx)
                          throw'. It simply calls a _transfer function and returns true.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['_address.transfer(_amount)', 'External.deposit(_amount)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - _address.transfer(_amount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the keyword
        '.transfer('.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - External.deposit(_amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['External.deposit(_amount)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['External'] should be checked in variable External
        Checked variables: External
            No The provided code is not a constructor as the function name 'initTax' does not match the contract name 'UnicornToken', nor is it explicitly named
            'constructor'. Additionally, the function does not contain any hardcoded instances of the state variable 'External'. The function references 'External', but
            it assigns it dynamically using 'FTPExternal(m_ExternalServiceAddress)' instead of a hardcoded value. Therefore, none of the criteria are fulfilled.

                Check direct function security
                    - function Taxable.initTax() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                      Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified patterns related to the conditions on msg.sender.
                    - function Taxable.initTax() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                      Reason: The given code does not contain any of the specified structures involving require or if statements. There are no require or if statements in
                      the code, therefore it does not fulfill any of the conditions outlined.
                Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
                The reachable functions are ['constructor']
