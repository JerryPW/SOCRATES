Function Security Analysis for DesTokenSale.fallback()
    The modifier of function fallback are ['stopInEmergency']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier stopInEmergency has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The given modifier 'stopInEmergency' does not include any code structures that match the specified characteristics. It doesn't enforce execution
          restrictions based on msg.sender, nor does it implement a lock operation or derive its action from a function name like 'Onlyxxx' or 'nonReentrant'.
    Check direct function security
        - function DesTokenSale.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not include any check related to msg.sender being equal to or not equal to an owner, address, leader, or CEO.
        - function DesTokenSale.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures. It uses several require statements for error checking, but none of them are in the format
          required by the given structures (checking boolean expressions and then modifying the boolean variable).
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['token.balanceOf(msg.sender).add(tokens)', 'token.transfer(msg.sender,tokens)', 'token.balanceOf(msg.sender)',
    'beneficiary.transfer(msg.value)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - token.transfer(msg.sender,tokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - beneficiary.transfer(msg.value) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        'beneficiary.transfer(msg.value)' contains the '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - token.balanceOf(msg.sender).add(tokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - token.transfer(msg.sender,tokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - token.balanceOf(msg.sender) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['token.balanceOf(msg.sender).add(tokens)', 'token.transfer(msg.sender,tokens)', 'token.balanceOf(msg.sender)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            Yes The provided code is a function definition where the function name matches the contract name 'DesTokenSale'. Typically, when the function name matches the
            contract name, it indicates that this function is a constructor, at least in versions of Solidity before 0.5.0, where constructors are explicitly named.
            Therefore, the function satisfies the first characteristic of being a constructor.
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            Yes The function is named 'DesTokenSale', which matches the contract name provided, indicating that the function is indeed a constructor. Constructors are
            special functions executed only once upon contract creation to initialize state variables or set up contract settings.
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            Yes The provided code contains a function named 'DesTokenSale' which matches the contract name 'DesTokenSale'. This indicates that the function is a
            constructor.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
