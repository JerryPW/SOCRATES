Function Security Analysis for VNETTokenPreSale.fallback()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
    Check direct function security
        - function VNETTokenPreSale.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not use any of the specified structures related to checking or asserting the identity of msg.sender.
        - function VNETTokenPreSale.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the required structures (1, 2, 3, or 4) as described in the characteristics. There are no statements requiring a
          boolean variable to be true or false followed by changing the value of that variable.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['vnetToken.balanceOf(address(this))', 'vnetToken.transfer(msg.sender,vnetAmount)', 'vnetToken.transfer(msg.sender,vnetBalance)',
    'msg.sender.transfer(weiAmount.sub(weiExpend))']
    Analyze Transfer
        - vnetToken.transfer(msg.sender,vnetAmount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - vnetToken.transfer(msg.sender,vnetBalance) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - msg.sender.transfer(weiAmount.sub(weiExpend)) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        'msg.sender.transfer(weiAmount.sub(weiExpend))' contains the keyword '.transfer('.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - vnetToken.balanceOf(address(this)) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - vnetToken.transfer(msg.sender,vnetAmount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - vnetToken.transfer(msg.sender,vnetBalance) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['vnetToken.balanceOf(address(this))', 'vnetToken.transfer(msg.sender,vnetAmount)', 'vnetToken.transfer(msg.sender,vnetBalance)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['vnetToken'] should be checked in variable vnetToken
        Checked variables: vnetToken
            Yes The code provided is a constructor for the contract VNETTokenPreSale, as the function is explicitly named 'constructor'.
        There are ['vnetToken'] should be checked in variable vnetToken
        Checked variables: vnetToken
            Yes The provided code is a constructor function, as it is explicitly named 'constructor'. Therefore, it satisfies the first characteristic.
        There are ['vnetToken'] should be checked in variable vnetToken
        Checked variables: vnetToken
            Yes The provided code is a constructor of the VNETTokenPreSale contract, as the function is unnamed and preceded by the 'constructor' keyword. Therefore, it
            meets the first characteristic.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
