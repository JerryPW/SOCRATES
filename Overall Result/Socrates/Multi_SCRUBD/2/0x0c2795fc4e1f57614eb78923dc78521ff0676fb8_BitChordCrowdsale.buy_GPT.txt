Start analyze function: BitChordCrowdsale.buy(address,uint256,uint256)
Function Security Analysis for BitChordCrowdsale.buy(address,uint256,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function buy.
    Check direct function security
        - function BitChordCrowdsale.buy(address,uint256,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any statements that match the specified control structure patterns involving 'msg.sender'.
        - function BitChordCrowdsale.buy(address,uint256,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does contain the pattern where `if(!phase2Flag)` is followed by `phase2Flag = true;`, however, this negation operation does not strictly occur
          immediately as there is intermediary logic modifying `stage_2_maxcap`. Thus, the necessary structural requirement for an immediate negation after checking the
          state is violated.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['fallback']
        Function Security Analysis for BitChordCrowdsale.fallback()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
            Check direct function security
                - function BitChordCrowdsale.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: There are no checks for msg.sender against any owner or specific address.
                - function BitChordCrowdsale.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures or sequences of if/require conditions followed by variable assignments as described in
                  the prompt rules.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['token.transfer(_address,availableTokens)', 'msg.sender.transfer(_value.sub(ethRequire))',
    'distributionAddress.transfer(address(this).balance.sub(oraclizeBalance))', 'token.transfer(_address,tokensToSend)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - msg.sender.transfer(_value.sub(ethRequire)) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        contains the '.transfer(' keyword after 'msg.sender', indicating ether is being transferred using the transfer function.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - distributionAddress.transfer(address(this).balance.sub(oraclizeBalance)) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the
        reason: The external call contains the '.transfer(' keyword after 'distributionAddress', indicating ether is being transferred using the transfer function..
        Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - token.transfer(_address,availableTokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - token.transfer(_address,tokensToSend) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['token.transfer(_address,availableTokens)', 'token.transfer(_address,tokensToSend)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            Yes The provided function is named 'BitChordCrowdsale', which matches the contract name 'BitChordCrowdsale'. This indicates that the function is a
            constructor.
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            Yes The provided function is named 'BitChordCrowdsale', which matches the contract name 'BitChordCrowdsale'. This indicates that the function is a constructor
            in older Solidity versions.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
