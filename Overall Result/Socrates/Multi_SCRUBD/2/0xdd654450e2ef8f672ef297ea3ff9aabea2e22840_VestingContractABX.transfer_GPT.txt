    Analyze External Address
        There are ['abx_token'] should be checked in variable abx_token
        Checked variables: abx_token
            Yes 1. The function name "VestingContractABX" matches the contract name "VestingContractABX", which indicates that this is a constructor function in older
            versions of Solidity.  2. There is no indication that the state variable "abx_token" is hardcoded in the given constructor code.
        There are ['abx_token'] should be checked in variable abx_token
        Checked variables: abx_token
            Yes 1. The function name matches the contract name, 'VestingContractABX', which indicates it is a constructor in Solidity versions prior to 0.4.22. Therefore,
            this code satisfies the first characteristic of being a constructor. 2. The function also assigns the input parameter '_abx_token' to the state variable
            'abx_token' and does not have any hardcoded state variable 'abx_token' value within the function, so it does not satisfy the second characteristic.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
