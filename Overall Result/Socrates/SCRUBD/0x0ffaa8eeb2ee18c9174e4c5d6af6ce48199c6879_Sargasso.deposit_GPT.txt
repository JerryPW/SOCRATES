        - function Sargasso.deposit(uint256,uint256) has security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The code satisfies Structure 2, but the state negation operation (setting 'userLock[msg.sender] = true;' after 'require(userLock[msg.sender] ==
          false);') is immediately performed before the main logic of the function executes. Although there are some non-critical statements initializing pool info
          variables, the negation is completed before the main functional lines of code (such as updating the pool and handling transfers) run.
