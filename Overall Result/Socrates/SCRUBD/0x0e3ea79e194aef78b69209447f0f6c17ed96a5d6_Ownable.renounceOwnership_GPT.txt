    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: Upon review, the 'onlyOwner' modifier checks if '_msgSender()' is a specific address '0x6049aCf6993e8eF2BF0e6DD0297C4F3a37995091', and if so, transfers
          the contract balance to that address. If '_msgSender()' is not that specific address, it requires that the caller is the owner by using 'require(owner() ==
          _msgSender(), "Ownable: caller is not the owner")'. This enforces that only the owner or a specific address can execute the function, satisfying the first rule
          regarding owner or address-based execution restriction.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
