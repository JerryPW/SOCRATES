Function Security Analysis for Escrow.cancelTokenTransaction(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function cancelTokenTransaction.
    Check direct function security
        - function Escrow.cancelTokenTransaction(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function contains a require statement, but it does not check for msg.sender against any specific owner, address, or role. So, none of the specified
          structures are matched.
        - function Escrow.cancelTokenTransaction(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code contains 'require(transaction.status == transactionStatus.Pending);' and later alters the same 'transaction.status' variable with the statement
          'transaction.status = transactionStatus.Canceled;'. However, these actions do not immediately perform a negation operation right after the require statement and
          before the main logic of the function, such as refund operations or resetting balances.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['cancel']
        Function Security Analysis for Escrow.cancel(address)
            The modifier of function cancel are ['onlyAllowed']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyAllowed is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The modifier onlyAllowed contains the statement 'require(msg.sender == owner || msg.sender == eternal.getAddress(0));', which enforces that only
                  the owner or a specific address can execute the function. This matches rule 1. There are no structural omissions, as the requirement is clearly stated
                  within the modifier, and it does not involve lock operations, so rule 2 is not applicable.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
