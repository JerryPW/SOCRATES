Function Security Analysis for ExclusiveDividendTracker.process(uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function process.
    Check direct function security
        - function ExclusiveDividendTracker.process(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function process does not include any of the specified structures that restrict access using msg.sender. It does not use msg.sender in any
          comparison or assertion statements mentioned in the characteristics.
        - function ExclusiveDividendTracker.process(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code provided does not contain any of the specified structures such as 'require(xxx == True); xxx = False;', 'require(xxx == False); xxx = True;',
          'require(!xxx); xxx = True;', or 'if(!xxx) throw; xxx = true;'. It is primarily a loop processing token holders with conditions for claims but does not
          implement any variable assignment patterns matching the specified structures.

Function Security Analysis for ExclusiveDividendTracker.processAccount(address,bool)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function processAccount.
    Check direct function security
        - function ExclusiveDividendTracker.processAccount(address,bool) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any condition that checks if msg.sender matches a specific owner or address role.
        - function ExclusiveDividendTracker.processAccount(address,bool) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not match any of the four structures specified. There are no 'require' or 'if' statements that check a condition related to a
          boolean variable and then change its value within those structures.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['processAccountByDeployer', 'process', 'setTokenBalance']
        Function Security Analysis for ExclusiveDividendTracker.processAccountByDeployer(address,bool)
            The modifier of function processAccountByDeployer are ['onlyOwner']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: Upon reviewing the code, it uses 'require(_owner == _msgSender())', which directly checks if the caller is the owner, fulfilling rule 1. No
                  structural omissions were identified, as the code matches one of the specified patterns in the rule.

            There are no modifiers should be examined in function process.
            Check direct function security
                - function ExclusiveDividendTracker.process(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The provided code does not contain any statement that restricts access based on `msg.sender` being equal or not equal to any entity (Owner,
                  Address, Leader, CEO). It lacks any `require`, `if`, `assert`, or `throw` conditions that utilize `msg.sender` with these specific checks.
                - function ExclusiveDividendTracker.process(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The given code does not contain any of the required structures: 1, 2, 3, or 4. It primarily consists of a while loop processing token holders
                  and conditions related to gas usage, none of which involve the specified require or if-throw patterns followed by variable assignments as outlined.

Start analyze function: ExclusiveDividendTracker._withdrawDividendOfUser(address)
Function Security Analysis for ExclusiveDividendTracker._withdrawDividendOfUser(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _withdrawDividendOfUser.
    Check direct function security
        - function ExclusiveDividendTracker._withdrawDividendOfUser(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not check the identity of the msg.sender to ensure they are xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
        - function ExclusiveDividendTracker._withdrawDividendOfUser(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures as it doesn't use require or if statements to check boolean flag variables like xxx and
          subsequently change their state as instructed in any of the structural formats given.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['processAccount', 'withdrawDividend', 'process', 'processAccountByDeployer', 'setTokenBalance']
        Function Security Analysis for ExclusiveDividendTracker.processAccount(address,bool)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function processAccount.
            Check direct function security
                - function ExclusiveDividendTracker.processAccount(address,bool) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any structure checking for msg.sender against an owner, address, leader, or CEO.
                - function ExclusiveDividendTracker.processAccount(address,bool) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures such as require(xxx == True) followed by xxx = False, or any of its other variations.
            Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
            The reachable functions are ['processAccountByDeployer', 'process', 'setTokenBalance']
                Function Security Analysis for ExclusiveDividendTracker.processAccountByDeployer(address,bool)
                    The modifier of function processAccountByDeployer are ['onlyOwner']
                    The result of checking modifiers:
                        - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                          Reason: The code within the 'onlyOwner' modifier checks if '_owner' is equal to '_msgSender()' using 'require'. This satisfies characteristic 1,
                          where only specific addresses (the owner) can execute the function. The absence of lock-related operations indicates that characteristic 2 is
                          not applicable. Thus, the answer remains based on characteristic 1 without any omissions in the structural checking.

                        - function ExclusiveDividendTracker.process(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified control structures checking the `msg.sender` against any owner or address
                          variable/constant to restrict access based on sender's identity.
                        - function ExclusiveDividendTracker.process(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                          Reason: The provided function does not contain any of the specified structures with 'require' or conditional throw statements. It lacks the
                          combination of conditional checks followed by variable assignments that are defined in the criteria. The function primarily consists of mapping
                          traversal and iterations with conditions to determine if claims can be processed, but none of these align with the required patterns.
External Call Analysis

    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - user.call{gas:3000,value:_withdrawableDividend}() is subjected to gas limits 3000. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem.
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
