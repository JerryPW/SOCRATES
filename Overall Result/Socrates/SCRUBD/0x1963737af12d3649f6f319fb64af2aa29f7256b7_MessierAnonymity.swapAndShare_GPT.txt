Function Security Analysis for MessierAnonymity.swapAndShare()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function swapAndShare.
    Check direct function security
        - function MessierAnonymity.swapAndShare() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function `swapAndShare()` does not contain any of the specified msg.sender checks or assertions related to ownership or specific address
          permissions. It only includes a check for `collectedFee` to be greater than 0.
        - function MessierAnonymity.swapAndShare() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given function does not satisfy any of the specified structures as there is no require statement that checks a boolean variable nor any setting/re-
          setting of boolean variable according to the patterns specified.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['deposit', 'forceSwapAndShare']
        Function Security Analysis for MessierAnonymity.deposit(bytes32)
            The modifier of function deposit are ['nonReentrant']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier nonReentrant is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: Upon re-evaluation, the nonReentrant modifier uses a lock operation indicated by incrementing the `_guardCounter` and checks afterward that the
                  expected value matches, effectively preventing reentry. Both lock (`_guardCounter += 1`) and release (`require(localCounter == _guardCounter)`)
                  operations are present, fulfilling the second characteristic fully.
        Function Security Analysis for MessierAnonymity.forceSwapAndShare()
            The modifier of function forceSwapAndShare are ['onlyOwner']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The code contains the statement 'require(msg.sender == messier_owner, "Only Owner can call this function.");' which enforces that only the
                  specific address (messier_owner) can execute the function, matching characteristic 1.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
