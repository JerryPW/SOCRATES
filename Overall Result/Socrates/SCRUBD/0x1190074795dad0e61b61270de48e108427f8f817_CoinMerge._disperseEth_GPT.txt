Function Security Analysis for CoinMerge._disperseEth()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _disperseEth.
    Check direct function security
        - function CoinMerge._disperseEth() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any requirement checks or conditional statements involving msg.sender, which are needed to match the specified
          characteristics.
        - function CoinMerge._disperseEth() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures related to variables being checked and then assigned true or false. It contains computations
          and transfers related to Ethereum balances without such conditional checks.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['_tax', 'transfer', 'transferFrom', '_transfer']
        Function Security Analysis for CoinMerge._tax(address)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function _tax.
            Check direct function security
                - function CoinMerge._tax(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain a condition explicitly checking if 'msg.sender' equals or does not equal an owner, leader, or CEO address.
                - function CoinMerge._tax(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures. It checks a condition with '_readyToTax(_sender)' but does not involve setting a
                  boolean variable to true or false as required by the patterns.
            Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
            The reachable functions are ['transfer', 'transferFrom', '_transfer']
                Function Security Analysis for CoinMerge.transfer(address,uint256)
                    There are no modifiers should be examined in function transfer.
                    Check direct function security
                        - function CoinMerge.transfer(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                          Reason: The code does not have any checks involving msg.sender being compared to an Owner/Address/Leader/CEO role.
                        - function CoinMerge.transfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                          Reason: The provided function code does not contain any statements that match the specified structures exactly. The code simply transfers an
                          amount and returns true without any requirement checks or condition handling as described.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['m_ProjectWallet.transfer(_projectBalance)', 'address(address(EthReflect)).transfer(_redistBalance)',
    'address(address(External)).transfer(_devBalance)', 'External.deposit(_devBalance)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - m_ProjectWallet.transfer(_projectBalance) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call contains
        '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - address(address(EthReflect)).transfer(_redistBalance) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call
        contains '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - address(address(External)).transfer(_devBalance) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call contains
        '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - External.deposit(_devBalance) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['External.deposit(_devBalance)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['External'] should be checked in variable External
        Checked variables: External
            Yes The provided code represents a constructor function, as it is explicitly named 'constructor'.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
