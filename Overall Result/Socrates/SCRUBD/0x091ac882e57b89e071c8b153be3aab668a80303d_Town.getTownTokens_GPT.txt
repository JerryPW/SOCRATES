Function Security Analysis for Town.getTownTokens(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function getTownTokens.
    Check direct function security
        - function Town.getTownTokens(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not include any of the structures related to msg.sender as listed in the characteristics.
        - function Town.getTownTokens(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not have the structures described. It only has a 'require' statement with 'holder != address(0)', which doesn't match any of the specified
          patterns.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['_token.transfer(holder,tokenBalance)', '_remunerationsQueue[i]._address.transfer(amount)', 'msg.sender.transfer(change)',
    '_remunerationsQueue[i_scope_1]._address.transfer(amount)', '_remunerationsQueue[i]._address.transfer(_remunerationsQueue[i]._amount)',

    Analyze Transfer
        - _token.transfer(holder,tokenBalance) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - _remunerationsQueue[i]._address.transfer(amount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        '_remunerationsQueue[i]._address.transfer(amount)' contains the '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - msg.sender.transfer(change) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        'msg.sender.transfer(change)' contains the '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - _remunerationsQueue[i_scope_1]._address.transfer(amount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The
        external call '_remunerationsQueue[i_scope_1]._address.transfer(amount)' contains the '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - _remunerationsQueue[i]._address.transfer(_remunerationsQueue[i]._amount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the
        reason: The external call '_remunerationsQueue[i]._address.transfer(_remunerationsQueue[i]._amount)' contains the '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in
        'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - _remunerationsQueue[i_scope_1]._address.transfer(_remunerationsQueue[i_scope_1]._amount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem.
        Here is the reason: The external call '_remunerationsQueue[i_scope_1]._address.transfer(_remunerationsQueue[i_scope_1]._amount)' contains the '.transfer('
        keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - _token.transfer(holder,tokenAmount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - _token.transfer(holder,tokenBalance) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - _token.transfer(holder,tokenAmount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['_token.transfer(holder,tokenBalance)', '_token.transfer(holder,tokenAmount)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['_token'] should be checked in variable _token
        Checked variables: _token
            Yes The function is named 'constructor', which is explicitly a constructor function in Solidity. Constructors are special functions that are only executed
            once when the contract is deployed. Additionally, the state variable '_token' is being set inside the constructor using 'tokenAddress' parameter, but it is
            not hardcoded. However, since the function is a constructor, it satisfies the first characteristic.
        There are ['_token'] should be checked in variable _token
        Checked variables: _token
            Yes The provided code snippet shows a constructor of a smart contract. I identified this because the function is named 'constructor'.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
