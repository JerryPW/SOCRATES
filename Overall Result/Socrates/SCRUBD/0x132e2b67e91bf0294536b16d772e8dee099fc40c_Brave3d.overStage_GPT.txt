Function Security Analysis for Brave3d.overStage(uint8)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function overStage.
    Check direct function security
        - function Brave3d.overStage(uint8) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The provided function does not contain any of the specified characteristics related to verifying msg.sender against xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
        - function Brave3d.overStage(uint8) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The structure that satisfies the given rules has an immediate transformation on `xxx`. The `assert(!finishStage.isFinish);` is followed by some logic
          and then `finishStage.isFinish = true;` at the end. The state change does not immediately occur after the state check, hence it doesn't satisfy the additional
          requirement for an immediate change before main logic.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['buyByName', 'withdraw', 'forceOverStage', 'setName', 'buyFromValue', 'buyByAddress']
        Function Security Analysis for Brave3d.buyByName(string)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function buyByName.
            Check direct function security
                - function Brave3d.buyByName(string) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not include any condition checking the msg.sender directly against an owner or specific leader address.
                - function Brave3d.buyByName(string) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code structure does not match any of the specified patterns. There is no 'require' statement that checks the truth value of a variable and
                  subsequently assigns the opposing boolean value to that variable.
