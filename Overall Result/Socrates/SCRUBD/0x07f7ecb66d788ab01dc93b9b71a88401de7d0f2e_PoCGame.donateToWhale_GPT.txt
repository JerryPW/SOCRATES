Function Security Analysis for PoCGame.donateToWhale(uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function donateToWhale.
    Check direct function security
        - function PoCGame.donateToWhale(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not check or restrict the sender using msg.sender in any of the specified manners.
        - function PoCGame.donateToWhale(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures involving a 'require' or 'if' statement with changing a boolean variable to true or false.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['donate']
        Function Security Analysis for PoCGame.donate()
            The modifier of function donate are ['isOpenToPublic']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier isOpenToPublic has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier checks if the function is open to the public using the 'openToPublic' flag but does not restrict execution to only the owner or
                  specific addresses, nor does it implement a lock operation. Therefore, it doesn't satisfy any of the specified characteristics.
            Check direct function security
                - function PoCGame.donate() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not include any require, if, or assert statement that contains checks for msg.sender being equal or not equal to a specific
                  owner, address, leader, or CEO.
                - function PoCGame.donate() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided function `donate` does not contain any of the specified structures that involve requiring or throwing based on a condition related
                  to a boolean variable. It does not manipulate any variable in the manner described by the scenarios given for structures 1 to 4.

        There are ['whale'] should be checked in variable whale
        Checked variables: whale
            Yes The function provided is a constructor because its name matches the convention for defining a constructor in Solidity (either matching the contract name
            'PoCGame' or being explicitly named 'constructor').
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
