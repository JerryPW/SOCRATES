Function Security Analysis for BoomerangLiquidity.payout()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function payout.
    Check direct function security
        - function BoomerangLiquidity.payout() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The given code does not contain any of the specified structures involving 'msg.sender'.
        - function BoomerangLiquidity.payout() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not contain patterns such as 'require(xxx == True); xxx = False;' or 'require(xxx == False); xxx = True;'. It only includes
          'require(balance > 1);' which does not fit the specified patterns since it involves a numeric comparison rather than a boolean check or update.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.send(payoutToSend)', 'weak_hands.buy.value(investment).gas(1000000)(msg.sender)',
    'participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.call.value(payoutToSend).gas(1000000)()']
    Analyze Transfer
        - participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.send(payoutToSend) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The
        external call contains '.send(' keyword, which satisfies the characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - The gas limit in weak_hands.buy.value(investment).gas(1000000)(msg.sender) is 1000000, which is too high. Therefore, it will not prevent REE problem.
        - The gas limit in participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.call.value(payoutToSend).gas(1000000)() is 1000000, which is too high. Therefore, it will not prevent
        REE problem.
    Remaining external call: ['weak_hands.buy.value(investment).gas(1000000)(msg.sender)',
    'participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.call.value(payoutToSend).gas(1000000)()']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['weak_hands'] should be checked in variable weak_hands
        Checked variables: weak_hands
            Yes The provided code is a function named 'BoomerangLiquidity', which matches the contract name 'BoomerangLiquidity'. This indicates that the function is a
            constructor.
        There are ['participants'] should be checked in variable participants
        Checked variables: participants
            No There is no constructor in the provided code. The function names 'deposit' and 'payout' do not match the contract name 'BoomerangLiquidity', nor is there a
            function explicitly named 'constructor'. Therefore, condition 1 is not satisfied. The external call within the methods does not use any hardcoded state
            variable values related to the function parameter or arguments; embeddings like 'participants' are dynamic and rely on input logic or contract structure.
            Hence, condition 2 is also not satisfied.
            Function Security Analysis for BoomerangLiquidity.deposit()
                There are no modifiers should be examined in function deposit.
                Check direct function security
                    - function BoomerangLiquidity.deposit() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                      Reason: None of the specified structures are present in the function code.
                    - function BoomerangLiquidity.deposit() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                      Reason: The function 'deposit' does not contain any of the specified structures. There are no 'require' statements or conditional checks that modify
                      a variable in the manner described.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
