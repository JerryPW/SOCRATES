Function Security Analysis for ICO.buyTokens(uint256,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function buyTokens.
    Check direct function security
        - function ICO.buyTokens(uint256,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any code related to checking msg.sender against specific addresses like owner or leader addresses. It primarily handles
          payment and transaction validation.
        - function ICO.buyTokens(uint256,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon reviewing the code again, the structure 'if(!xxx) throw;' is found:  1. 'if (priceToBuyInFinney <= 0) {throw;}' and  2. 'if (_priceToBuyInFinney <=
          0) {throw;}' However, these structures do not change any variable to true afterwards.  Therefore, none of the specified structures 1, 2, 3 or 4 are fully
          matched, as the essential sequence of checking a condition/signalling an error and then setting the variable is not completed in this code.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['erc20TokensContract.transfer(msg.sender,_quantity)', 'erc20TokensContract.balanceOf(this)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - erc20TokensContract.transfer(msg.sender,_quantity) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - erc20TokensContract.transfer(msg.sender,_quantity) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - erc20TokensContract.balanceOf(this) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['erc20TokensContract.transfer(msg.sender,_quantity)', 'erc20TokensContract.balanceOf(this)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['erc20TokensContract'] should be checked in variable erc20TokensContract
        Checked variables: erc20TokensContract
            No The function 'setErc20TokensContract' neither matches the contract name 'ICO' nor is it explicitly named 'constructor'. Therefore, this is not a
            constructor function.   Moreover, the function does not contain the hardcoded value of the state variable 'erc20TokensContract'. Instead, it assigns the state
            variable with the value of '_erc20TokensContractAddress' passed as a parameter. Therefore, the function does not hardcode the state variable.  Since the
            function does not satisfy either of the specified characteristics, the output is 'No'.
            Function Security Analysis for ICO.setErc20TokensContract(address)
                There are no modifiers should be examined in function setErc20TokensContract.
                Check direct function security
                    - function ICO.setErc20TokensContract(address) has security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender, the function would not cause
                    REE problem.
                      Reason: The function contains a check if (msg.sender != owner) throw; which matches the third structure criterion since the variable 'owner' is not
                      guided by a local variable within the function.
        There are ['erc20TokensContract'] should be checked in variable erc20TokensContract
        Checked variables: erc20TokensContract
            No The function `setErc20TokensContract` does not match the contract name 'ICO' nor is it explicitly named 'constructor'. Therefore, it is not a constructor.
            Additionally, it does not hardcode the state variable 'erc20TokensContract' as it assigns a value to it at runtime based on an input parameter. Thus, it does
            not satisfy any of the provided characteristics.
            Function Security Analysis for ICO.setErc20TokensContract(address)
                There are no modifiers should be examined in function setErc20TokensContract.
                Check direct function security
                    - function ICO.setErc20TokensContract(address) has security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender, the function would not cause
                    REE problem.
                      Reason: The code contains the structure 'if (msg.sender != owner) throw;' which matches one of the specified criteria.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
