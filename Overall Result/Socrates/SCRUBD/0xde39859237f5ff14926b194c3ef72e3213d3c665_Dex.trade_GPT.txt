Function Security Analysis for Dex.trade(uint256,ERC20,uint256,ERC20,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function trade.
    Check direct function security
        - function Dex.trade(uint256,ERC20,uint256,ERC20,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not include any lines of code that check if msg.sender is equal or not equal to a specific owner, address, leader, or CEO as per the
          required patterns.
        - function Dex.trade(uint256,ERC20,uint256,ERC20,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not satisfy any of the specified structures as it lacks the 'require' statement involving setting a boolean variable or throwing
          exceptions based on a boolean condition. There is no Boolean logic conditioning based on 'require', and changes in the state of a Boolean variable. The 'assert'
          in this function is used purely to ensure the transaction correctness but not in accordance with the specified structures involving 'require'.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['dest.transfer(msg.sender,destAmount)', 'msg.sender.send(destAmount)', 'src.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),srcAmount)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - dest.transfer(msg.sender,destAmount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - msg.sender.send(destAmount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the '.send('
        keyword, matching the second characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - dest.transfer(msg.sender,destAmount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - src.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),srcAmount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['dest.transfer(msg.sender,destAmount)', 'src.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),srcAmount)']
    Analyze External Address
        The variable 'dest' in external call 'dest.transfer(msg.sender,destAmount)' has no state variable assigned. Therefore we check whether it has been hardcoded in
        the function.
            No The 'dest' variable is neither assigned a fixed value nor directly locked in the code. It is passed as a parameter to the function and is used in various
            operations within the function's logic. This shows that 'dest' is flexible and can take any value depending on how the function is called.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
