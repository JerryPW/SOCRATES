    The modifier of function open are ['onlyOwner']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The modifier `onlyOwner` contains the statement `require(owner() == _msgSender(), "Ownable: caller is not the owner")`, which enforces that only the
          owner can execute the function, satisfying characteristic 1. There is no indication of a lock and unlock operation in the code, nor any structures that suggest
          a singleton entry mechanism, so characteristic 2 does not apply.
