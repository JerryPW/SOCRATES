Function Security Analysis for YZYVault.unstake(uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function unstake.
    Check direct function security
        - function YZYVault.unstake(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not include any explicit checks involving `msg.sender` equality or inequality against an owner-like variable (such as xxxOwner,
          xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO) in the specified patterns.
        - function YZYVault.unstake(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon re-evaluation, the code contains the statement 'require(!isContract(_msgSender()), "Vault: Could not be contract.");'. However, the subsequent
          structure doesn't set 'isContract' to 'True', nor does it contain a 'xxx = True;' as per the structure requirements. Thus, the code does not fully satisfy the
          condition for any of the specified structures because it only matches the 'require(!xxx);' part without the subsequent 'xxx = True;'. Therefore, my previous
          judgment was incorrect.

        There are ['_yzyETHV2Pair'] should be checked in variable _yzyETHV2Pair
        Checked variables: _yzyETHV2Pair
            Yes The code snippet provided is a function named 'changeYzyETHPair', and it directly assigns a new value to the state variable '_yzyETHV2Pair'. This
            indicates that the function hardcodes the state variable because it performs direct assignment based on the function's arguments.
        There are ['_yzyETHV2Pair'] should be checked in variable _yzyETHV2Pair
        Checked variables: _yzyETHV2Pair
            No The function 'changeYzyETHPair' does not match the contract name 'YZYVault', nor is it named 'constructor', thus it is not a constructor. Additionally, the
            function does modify the state variable '_yzyETHV2Pair', setting it to the provided 'yzyETHPair', but this is based on the input to the function, not a
            hardcoded value. Therefore, it does not satisfy the criteria for having a hardcoded state variable.
            Function Security Analysis for YZYVault.changeYzyETHPair(address)
                The modifier of function changeYzyETHPair are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: Upon reinspection, the 'require(_owner == _msgSender())' statement accurately enforces the restriction that only the owner can execute the
                      function. There is no structural omission, as this single statement directly satisfies rule 1, which checks for ownership enforcement in the code.
        There are ['_yzyETHV2Pair'] should be checked in variable _yzyETHV2Pair
        Checked variables: _yzyETHV2Pair
            Yes The function name 'changeYzyETHPair' does not match the contract name 'YZYVault', nor is it named 'constructor', so it is not a constructor function.
            However, the function updates the state variable '_yzyETHV2Pair', which is the provided state variable. Therefore, it satisfies the second characteristic by
            modifying the given state variable.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

            Furthermore, the state variable '_yzy' is assigned a new value from the function input 'yzy', which means it is not hardcoded in the function.
            Function Security Analysis for YZYVault.changeYzyAddress(address)
                The modifier of function changeYzyAddress are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The modifier code explicitly checks if the caller (msg.sender) is the owner (_owner) using require, which fits with characteristic 1. There
                      are no lock and unlock operations present, nor do they need to be for characteristic 1. Therefore, structural condition 1 is satisfied without any
                      omissions.

                  throwing errors based on the sender's identity.
                - function YZYVault.claimSwapAvailableReward() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures involving require statement with strict boolean logic or if-throw logic before

            contract name 'YZYVault', nor is it explicitly named 'constructor'. Additionally, there is no hardcoded value assigned to the '_yzy' state variable within the
            function; it assigns a value based on the input parameter 'yzy'.
            Function Security Analysis for YZYVault.changeYzyAddress(address)

                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: Upon reviewing the code again, the modifier onlyOwner uses 'require(_owner == _msgSender(), "Ownable: caller is not the owner");', which
                      clearly matches rule 1, as it enforces that only the owner can execute the function. There are no structural omissions.

    Check direct function security
        - function YZYVault.claimSwapReward() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any checks for `msg.sender` against an owner or specific address. It only references `_msgSender()` in various functionalities
          without privilege checks.
        - function YZYVault.claimSwapReward() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures where a requirement or condition is checked and a variable is explicitly set to True or
          False based on that requirement.

            No The function 'changeYzyAddress' is not a constructor as its name does not match the contract name 'YZYVault' and it is not explicitly named 'constructor'.
            The state variable '_yzy' is set within the function, but it uses a parameter 'yzy' to set its value. Therefore, the function does not hardcode the state
            variable '_yzy'.
            Function Security Analysis for YZYVault.changeYzyAddress(address)
                The modifier of function changeYzyAddress are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The modifier 'onlyOwner' enforces that only the owner can execute the function by checking if _msgSender() is equal to _owner using a
                      require statement, as seen in the line 'require(_owner == _msgSender(), "Ownable: caller is not the owner");'. This satisfies characteristic 1.

    Check direct function security
        - function YZYVault.safeYzyTransfer(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The examined function 'safeYzyTransfer' does not include any of the specified control structures related to 'msg.sender'. Therefore, it does not satisfy
          the criteria outlined for ownership or permission checks based on the 'msg.sender' field.
        - function YZYVault.safeYzyTransfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code provided lacks any structure that matches any of the predefined patterns. There are no 'require' or conditional throw statements checking a

                  specified structures.
                - function YZYVault.unstake(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: Upon re-evaluating the code, the 'require(!xxx)' statement is matched but there isn't a clear 'xxx = True' statement or equivalent in the code.
                  The code has a 'require(!isContract(_msgSender()))' check but does not follow with a 'xxx = True' or equivalent action directly. Therefore, none of the

        There are ['_uniswapV2Router'] should be checked in variable _uniswapV2Router
        Checked variables: _uniswapV2Router
            Yes The provided code contains a function named 'constructor', which matches one of the characteristics required. Constructors do not hardcode state variables
            in the sense of external functions, but they set initial values within the contract deployment. The contract name is YZYVault, and the function is explicitly
            named 'constructor'. This satisfies the first characteristic of checking if the function is a constructor.
        The variable 'fromTokenAddress' in external call 'IERC20(fromTokenAddress).approve(address(_uniswapV2Router),tokenAmount)' has no state variable assigned in
        YZYVault.swapTokensForTokens(address,address,uint256,address). Considering that it is an internal/private function, we analyze the function inputs.

                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The modifier contains a require statement that checks if the caller is the owner with `require(_owner == _msgSender(), "Ownable: caller is
                      not the owner");`. This matches structure 1, where the code enforces only specific addresses (the owner in this case) to execute the function.

            Checked variables: _weth
                Yes The provided code contains a constructor for the contract. The function named "constructor" is explicitly defined in the code, and it initializes
                several state variables, one of which is _weth. This satisfies the first characteristic, which is checking for the constructor. Additionally, there is
                hardcoding of state variables in the constructor, such as setting constants like _firstRewardPeriod, _firstRewardAmount, etc., but the specifically
                hardcoded variable in question, _weth, is initialized using a passed parameter rather than being hardcoded.
            There are ['_weth'] should be checked in variable _weth
            Checked variables: _weth
                Yes The provided code is a constructor for the contract named YZYVault because the function is explicitly defined with the 'constructor' keyword. The
                function sets various state variables, including _weth, by initializing it with the passed parameter 'weth'. Since this matches the first characteristic
                of checking if the code is a constructor, the guidance is satisfied.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
