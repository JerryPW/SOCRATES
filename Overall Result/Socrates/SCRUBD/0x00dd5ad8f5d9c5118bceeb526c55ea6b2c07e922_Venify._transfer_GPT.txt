Function Security Analysis for Venify._transfer(address,address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _transfer.
    Check direct function security
        - function Venify._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not have any statements checking or asserting that msg.sender is any kind of owner, address, leader, or CEO.
        - function Venify._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not include a require statement for boolean variable conditions or throw statements with a boolean check that subsequently change
          the value of the same variable like the structures specified. Instead, it uses these boolean checks in a typical conditional logic flow without altering the
          same variable within those conditions in the manner described.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transferFrom', 'transfer']

                - function Venify.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any statements that check or assert the identity of msg.sender against specific owner or leader addresses.
                - function Venify.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: None of the required structures are present in the code. There are no 'require' statements or specific structures involving checking or flipping
                  boolean variables as outlined in the conditions.

    There are no modifiers should be examined in function swapTokensForETH.
    Check direct function security
        - function Venify.swapTokensForETH(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any statement that checks the identity of msg.sender against any kind of owner or address criteria. Hence, none of the
          specified code structures (1 to 4) are present in this function.
        - function Venify.swapTokensForETH(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures. There are no 'require' or 'if' statements with the prescribed patterns, nor are there
          sequences of setting a variable to 'True' and 'False' or changing the variable's state after a 'require' or 'if' check.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

            Check direct function security
                - function Venify._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any condition checking 'msg.sender' against an owner, address, or a specific role.
                - function Venify._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code sets `inSwapAndLiquify` to true and later reverts it to false, but it does not contain a require statement that checks the
                  condition `(require(inSwapAndLiquify == False)` or `require(!inSwapAndLiquify)`). Therefore, it doesn't match any of the specified structures.
            Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

                          Reason: The function does not have any checks or conditions involving the structure with 'msg.sender' for ownership verification.
                        - function Venify.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                          Reason: The given function 'transferFrom' does not contain any 'require' statements nor does it follow a pattern where a condition is checked on
                          a boolean variable and then the variable is explicitly set to true or false. Therefore, none of the specified structures are present in the
                          function.

Function Security Analysis for Venify.sendETH(address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function sendETH.
    Check direct function security
        - function Venify.sendETH(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not check any condition related to msg.sender involving ownership, specific addresses like an owner or administrative roles like
          Leader or CEO. It only checks the contract balance and the success of the transaction.
        - function Venify.sendETH(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any variable checking against 'True' or 'False', nor does it assign 'xxx = True' or 'xxx = False' after such checks. The
          'require' statements in the function do not match the structures mentioned in any of the conditions.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

            There are no modifiers should be examined in function _transfer.
            Check direct function security
                - function Venify._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not include any authorization checks involving checking the caller's address against an owner or leader address, such as
                  msg.sender == xxxOwner or msg.sender != xxxOwner.
                - function Venify._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: Upon re-evaluating the code, the conditions for any of the structures (1, 2, 3, or 4) require two specific statements to be present. In this
                  code, we use the condition '!inSwapAndLiquify' in the 'if' statement, but there is no 'require(!xxx);' or 'if(!xxx) throw;' construct. We also find
                  'inSwapAndLiquify = true;' and subsequently 'inSwapAndLiquify = false;', but the preceding conditionals 'require(xxx == False);' or 'require(!xxx);' or
                  'if(!xxx) throw;' for those structures are absent. Therefore, none of the specified structures meet both the required conditional and assignment
                  statements.
            Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

                          CEO.
                        - function Venify.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                          Reason: The given code does not contain any of the specified structures involving require statements checking variable conditions, setting these
                          variables to True or False, or throwing exceptions based on these variable checks.
