    Check direct function security
        - function CompliantCrowdsaleHardcap._approveMint(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not use msg.sender in any require, if, or assert statements with the specified structures.
        - function CompliantCrowdsaleHardcap._approveMint(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures with 'require' or 'if'.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

        Function Security Analysis for CompliantCrowdsaleHardcap.approveMint(uint256)
            The modifier of function approveMint are ['onlyValidator']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyValidator is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The code uses 'require(msg.sender == validator);' which is a check to ensure that the function is only executable by the 'validator' address.
                  This directly satisfies characteristic 1, as it enforces execution control by an owner-like address.
        Function Security Analysis for CompliantCrowdsaleHardcap.bulkApproveMints(uint256[])
            The modifier of function bulkApproveMints are ['onlyValidator']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyValidator is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The modifier code `require(msg.sender == validator);` enforces that only the `validator` address can execute the function. This matches the
                  first characteristic where only the owner or specific addresses are allowed to execute, specifically it uses `require(msg.sender ==
                  xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO)` format.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
