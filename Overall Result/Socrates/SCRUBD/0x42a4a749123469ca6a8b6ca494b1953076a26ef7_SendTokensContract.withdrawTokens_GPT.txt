    Check direct function security
        - function SendTokensContract.withdrawTokens() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any check related to msg.sender being xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO.
        - function SendTokensContract.withdrawTokens() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code checks whether the balance associated with the sender is greater than 0 and whether the current time qualifies for release. It doesn't
          modify these conditions (from true to false or vice versa) in the required structure within the function.

    Direct external call: ['tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,bals[msg.sender])']
    Analyze Transfer
        - tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,bals[msg.sender]) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,bals[msg.sender]) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,bals[msg.sender])']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['tokenReward'] should be checked in variable tokenReward
        Checked variables: tokenReward
            No The provided function 'setTokenReward' does not match the contract name 'SendTokensContract' and is not explicitly named 'constructor', so it is not a
            constructor function. Additionally, it does not hardcode any variable values for 'tokenReward', as it assigns 'tokenReward' using an input parameter
            '_tokenContractAddress', which is not hardcoded. Therefore, the function does not satisfy either characteristic.
            Function Security Analysis for SendTokensContract.setTokenReward(address)
                The modifier of function setTokenReward are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: Upon re-evaluation, the code contains the condition 'require(msg.sender == owner);' which fully enforces that only the owner can execute the
                      function. This satisfies rule 1, as there is a clear restriction based on the address of the sender. There is no structural omission in this
                      assessment.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
