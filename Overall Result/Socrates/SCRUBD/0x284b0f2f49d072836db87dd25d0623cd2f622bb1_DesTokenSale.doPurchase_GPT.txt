Function Security Analysis for DesTokenSale.doPurchase(address)
    The modifier of function doPurchase are ['stopInEmergency']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier stopInEmergency has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier checks a boolean variable 'halted', but it doesn't strictly check for specific addresses or implement a reentrancy lock mechanism. It
          doesn't satisfy any of the specific characteristics given.
    Check direct function security
        - function DesTokenSale.doPurchase(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the 4 specified conditions related to authorization checks against msg.sender.
        - function DesTokenSale.doPurchase(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures involving a require statement followed by a variable assignment to True/False and potentially
          another variable assignment to True/False later on. The require statements in the function strictly check conditions without additional variable assignments as
          specified.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['doPurchaseFor', 'fallback']
        Function Security Analysis for DesTokenSale.doPurchaseFor(address)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function doPurchaseFor.
            Check direct function security
                - function DesTokenSale.doPurchaseFor(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain any verification conditions such as require, if, or assert statements checking msg.sender against any ownership or
                  leadership role.
                - function DesTokenSale.doPurchaseFor(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures. It defines a simple function `doPurchaseFor` that calls another function
                  `doPurchase`, without any conditionals or require statements.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['token.balanceOf(_sender)', 'token.balanceOf(_sender).add(tokens)', 'token.transfer(_sender,tokens)', 'beneficiary.transfer(msg.value)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - token.transfer(_sender,tokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - beneficiary.transfer(msg.value) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        'beneficiary.transfer(msg.value)' contains '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - token.balanceOf(_sender) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - token.balanceOf(_sender).add(tokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - token.transfer(_sender,tokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['token.balanceOf(_sender)', 'token.balanceOf(_sender).add(tokens)', 'token.transfer(_sender,tokens)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            Yes The provided code is a constructor for the contract named "DesTokenSale" because the function name matches the contract name, indicating that it is a
            constructor in Solidity versions prior to 0.4.22. The constructor initializes the state variables 'token' with a value passed to it ('DesToken(_token)'), but
            it does not hardcode the 'token' variable.  In older versions of Solidity, a constructor is defined by creating a function with the same name as the contract,
            which is the case here, so it satisfies the first characteristic.
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            Yes The function 'DesTokenSale' shares its name with the contract, indicating that it is a constructor. Constructors are typically used to initialize the
            state variables of a contract, and this matches the pattern we see here. The state variable 'token' is being assigned a value from the input '_token', and
            there is no hardcoding of this variable within the constructor.
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            Yes The function name 'DesTokenSale' matches the contract name 'DesTokenSale', indicating it is a constructor according to characteristic 1.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
