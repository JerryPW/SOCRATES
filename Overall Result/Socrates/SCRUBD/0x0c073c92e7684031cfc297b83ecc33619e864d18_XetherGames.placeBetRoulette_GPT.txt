Function Security Analysis for XetherGames.sendDividends()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function sendDividends.
    Check direct function security
        - function XetherGames.sendDividends() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not check or require 'msg.sender' in any condition like the predefined patterns.
        - function XetherGames.sendDividends() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures: no 'require' or 'if' statements checking a variable and then setting it to true or false
          within the function.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['xEtherTokensContract.ecosystemDividends.value(tmpDividends)()']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - xEtherTokensContract.ecosystemDividends.value(tmpDividends)() ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['xEtherTokensContract.ecosystemDividends.value(tmpDividends)()']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['xEtherTokensContract'] should be checked in variable xEtherTokensContract
        Checked variables: xEtherTokensContract
            No 1. The function name 'setXEtherContract' does not match the contract name 'XetherGames', nor is it named 'constructor'. Therefore, it does not satisfy the
            first characteristic as being a constructor.  2. The function is attempting to set the state variable 'xEtherTokensContract' with the passed argument
            'xEtherContract', which is not hardcoded. It is a parameter and not a hardcoded value. Hence, it does not hardcode the state variable.
            Function Security Analysis for XetherGames.setXEtherContract(address)
                The modifier of function setXEtherContract are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: After reviewing the code in the modifier, the relevant part is 'require (msg.sender == owner, "OnlyOwner methods called by non-owner.");',
                      which checks if the msg.sender is the owner and prohibits non-owner execution, directly matching characteristic 1. There is no structural omission
                      regarding this check, and no lock mechanism like 'lock/unlock' is present, making characteristic 2 irrelevant here. Hence, the judgment remains
                      correct based on matching characteristic 1.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
