    Check direct function security
        - function KUNOICHIX._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The provided code does not include any of the specific structures that pertain to direct comparisons involving `msg.sender`. It does not use comparisons
          like `require(msg.sender == owner)`, `if(msg.sender != owner)`, or any other form of sender ownership verification such as assertions.  The visibility checks
          and conditions are primarily based on addresses like 'from' and 'to', checks on trading status, specific conditions for gas prices, or transfer amounts, and
          rules for early buys, none of which use the `msg.sender` for access control that is specified in the given criteria.
        - function KUNOICHIX._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not match any of the specified structures because there are no 'require' statements followed by an assignment to a boolean that flips it
          from True to False or vice versa. Also, there are no if statements that throw followed by such assignments.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transferFrom', 'transfer']
        Function Security Analysis for KUNOICHIX.transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transferFrom.
            Check direct function security
                - function KUNOICHIX.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified patterns that check msg.sender against an owner, address, or leader identity.
                - function KUNOICHIX.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures where a variable is required to be true or false, and then set to the
                  opposite boolean value. It simply performs a transfer and an allowance update.

Start analyze function: KUNOICHIX.swapBack()
Function Security Analysis for KUNOICHIX.swapBack()
    The modifier of function swapBack are ['lockTheSwap']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier lockTheSwap is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The modifier 'lockTheSwap' matches pattern 2 as it sets 'inSwapAndLiquify' to true before the function runs ('inSwapAndLiquify = true;') and resets it
          to false afterwards ('inSwapAndLiquify = false;'), ensuring an enter-only-once structure is respected.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
