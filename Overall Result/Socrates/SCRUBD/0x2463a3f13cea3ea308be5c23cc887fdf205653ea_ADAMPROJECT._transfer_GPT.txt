    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _transfer.
    Check direct function security
        - function ADAMPROJECT._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any checks related to 'msg.sender' being or not being an xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO. It does not match any of the
          specified patterns for 'msg.sender'.
        - function ADAMPROJECT._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the structures specified in the prompt. It contains `require` statements, but they are not of the format
          `require(xxx == True)` or `require(xxx == False)` as described. Additionally, there is no statement that directly sets such a variable to `True` or `False`.
          Instead, the `require` statements are used to enforce conditions on variables like `sender`, `recipient`, `amount`, etc., which do not follow the specified
          structure.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transfer', 'transferFrom']
        Function Security Analysis for ADAMPROJECT.transfer(address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transfer.
            Check direct function security
                - function ADAMPROJECT.transfer(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not include any of the specified structures related to checking msg.sender against owner or leader addresses.
                - function ADAMPROJECT.transfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The given function does not contain any of the specified structures. There is no use of require statements, assignments to a variable following
                  those requires, or any 'if' statements that could lead to a throw. The code is a simple return statement that invokes another function.

Start analyze function: ADAMPROJECT.swapBack()
Function Security Analysis for ADAMPROJECT.swapBack()
    The modifier of function swapBack are ['lockTheSwap']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier lockTheSwap is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The modifier 'lockTheSwap' sets a flag 'inSwapAndLiquify' to true before the function execution and resets it to false afterward, ensuring that the
          function enters only once. This matches the criteria for lock operations with both setting and resetting in place.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
