Function Security Analysis for Locker.unlock(uint8)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function unlock.
    Check direct function security
        - function Locker.unlock(uint8) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not have any conditional checks or assertions directly relating to `msg.sender` with roles like xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
        - function Locker.unlock(uint8) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code snippet does not have any of the specified structures involving a variable checked and then reassigned to a boolean value. All the checks
          and operations present are related to other conditions that do not meet any of the specified patterns.

    Analyze Gas
        - APIX.transfer(receiver,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['APIX.transfer(receiver,amount)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['APIX'] should be checked in variable APIX
        Checked variables: APIX
            Yes The function provided in the code is named 'constructor', which matches the explicit naming for a constructor function in Solidity. Constructor functions
            are special functions in Solidity that initialize state variables when a contract is deployed. Since the function is named 'constructor', it satisfies the
            first characteristic mentioned for external call functions.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
