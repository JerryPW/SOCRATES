Function Security Analysis for Escrow.userRecover(address,address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function userRecover.
    Check direct function security
        - function Escrow.userRecover(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not include any explicit checks or assertions for msg.sender with respect to ownership or specific roles, such as 'Owner', 'Leader',
          'CEO', etc. It involves operations on an address and has external calls but lacks the specified conditional structures.
        - function Escrow.userRecover(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any 'require' statements or 'if' conditions, and thus does not match any of the specified structures.

Start analyze function: Escrow.recovery(address)
Function Security Analysis for Escrow.recovery(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function recovery.
    Check direct function security
        - function Escrow.recovery(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The presented function does not include any require, if, or assert statements that specifically check if msg.sender is equal to a specified owner or
          address, nor any logical condition that suggests such a check. It simply calls two functions, r1 and r2, with _tag as an argument.
        - function Escrow.recovery(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified patterns such as require statements or if conditions checking a boolean variable with subsequent
          assignments to that variable. Both the require()/if() statements and variable assignments are missing.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['userRecover', 'release', 'releaseFunds']

            There are no modifiers should be examined in function userRecover.
            Check direct function security
                - function Escrow.userRecover(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not have any structure that checks or asserts the equality or inequality of msg.sender with xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
                - function Escrow.userRecover(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code provided does not contain any of the specified structures related to the handling of boolean expressions. The function logic revolves
                  around the manipulation and transfer of transactions but doesn't include any require or if statement checking and then updating a boolean, nor any
                  subsequent optional resetting of that boolean.

Start analyze function: Escrow.r1(address)
Function Security Analysis for Escrow.r1(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function r1.
    Check direct function security
        - function Escrow.r1(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any statements that constrain the function's execution based on the msg.sender being an owner, address, leader, or CEO.
        - function Escrow.r1(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon reviewing the code, it performs a `require` check to ensure the transaction status equals `transactionStatus.PendingR1`. Then, it updates the
          transaction status to `transactionStatus.PendingR2`. This matches part of the identified structure (checking a condition and then changing a related state), but
          it doesn't fully match structures 1 or 2 because the require check and the status change don't strictly satisfy the 'xxx == False' then 'xxx = True' or similar
          condition swapping patterns defined in the structures.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['userRecover', 'recovery', 'release', 'releaseFunds']
        Function Security Analysis for Escrow.userRecover(address,address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function userRecover.
            Check direct function security
                - function Escrow.userRecover(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The provided code does not include any msg.sender related checks or conditions that match the specified structures.
                - function Escrow.userRecover(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The given code does not include any structure that matches the listed characteristics. It involves setting up a transaction and transferring
                  amounts, but it doesn't have any 'require' statements or conditional checks that directly affect a boolean variable's truth value as described.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['base.transferFrom(reserve,_tag,rF)']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - base.transferFrom(reserve,_tag,rF) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['base.transferFrom(reserve,_tag,rF)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['base'] should be checked in variable base
        Checked variables: base
            Yes The provided code contains a constructor function named 'constructor', which matches one of the characteristics for a positive judgment. This indicates
            the function is responsible for initializing the contract, but it does not involve hardcoding the state variable 'base'.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: Escrow.r2(address)
Function Security Analysis for Escrow.r2(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function r2.
    Check direct function security
        - function Escrow.r2(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not check for msg.sender being equal to any of the roles like Owner, Address, Leader, or CEO.
        - function Escrow.r2(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code contains a require statement that checks if 'transaction.status' equals 'transactionStatus.PendingR2' followed by a change of status later in
          the code. However, it does not change 'transaction.status' to 'false' or have variables switched from false to true, nor does it use the 'if (!xxx) throw'
          pattern directly within the specified structural constraints.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['userRecover', 'recovery', 'release', 'releaseFunds']

                - function Escrow.userRecover(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: None of the specified structures are present in the function.
                - function Escrow.userRecover(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not have any require or if(!xxx) throw statements that check for a boolean variable's value and then change its state in the
                  required manner.
