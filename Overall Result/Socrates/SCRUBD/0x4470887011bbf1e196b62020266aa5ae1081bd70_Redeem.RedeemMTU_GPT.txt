Function Security Analysis for Redeem.RedeemMTU(bool)
    The modifier of function RedeemMTU are ['paused']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier paused has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier 'paused' checks a boolean 'Paused' but does not enforce specific addresses or lock operation logic. It simply checks a condition, so it
          does not meet any listed criteria for 'Yes'.
    Check direct function security
        - function Redeem.RedeemMTU(bool) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified patterns that check for msg.sender against a specific owner or authority role. There is no require, if,
          or assert statement comparing msg.sender to an xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
        - function Redeem.RedeemMTU(bool) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not have any of the specified structures. The require condition checks if 'AppliedUnits' is greater than 0, but it doesn't change the
          'AppliedUnits' variable to false or true afterward, nor has any such interaction in terms of boolean assignments or checks with require(!xxx), making none of
          the four specified patterns applicable.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['msg.sender.transfer(withdrawVal)', 'tokenFunction.transfer(msg.sender,AppliedUnits)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - msg.sender.transfer(withdrawVal) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        'msg.sender.transfer(withdrawVal)' contains the '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - tokenFunction.transfer(msg.sender,AppliedUnits) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - tokenFunction.transfer(msg.sender,AppliedUnits) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['tokenFunction.transfer(msg.sender,AppliedUnits)']
    Analyze External Address
        The variable 'tokenFunction' in external call 'tokenFunction.transfer(msg.sender,AppliedUnits)' has no state variable assigned. Therefore we check whether it has
        been hardcoded in the function.
            No The variable 'tokenFunction' is assigned a value using a function call (token(getAddress("unit"))), which indicates that it is not a hardcoded value, but
            rather dynamically retrieved.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
