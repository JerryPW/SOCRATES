Function Security Analysis for DesTokenSale.fallback()
    The modifier of function fallback are ['stopInEmergency']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier stopInEmergency has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier 'stopInEmergency' does not enforce ownership or specific address execution, nor does it demonstrate a lock operation. The provided code
          checks if 'halted' is false, which does not satisfy any of the specified conditions. Therefore, based solely on the given information, no characteristic from
          the prompt applies.
    Check direct function security
        - function DesTokenSale.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any checks or assertions involving msg.sender and xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
        - function DesTokenSale.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code contains the statement 'require(tokensSelling != 0);', but it doesn't set the variable 'tokensSelling' to 'False' or 'True' after that.
          Therefore it does not match any of the specified structures.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['token.transfer(msg.sender,tokens)', 'token.balanceOf(msg.sender).add(tokens)', 'beneficiary.transfer(msg.value)',
    'token.balanceOf(msg.sender)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - token.transfer(msg.sender,tokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - beneficiary.transfer(msg.value) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains
        '.transfer(' keyword indicating a transfer function is present.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - token.transfer(msg.sender,tokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - token.balanceOf(msg.sender).add(tokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - token.balanceOf(msg.sender) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['token.transfer(msg.sender,tokens)', 'token.balanceOf(msg.sender).add(tokens)', 'token.balanceOf(msg.sender)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            Yes The given code is a constructor because the function name 'DesTokenSale' matches the contract name 'DesTokenSale'. Therefore, this satisfies the first
            characteristic.
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            Yes The provided function 'DesTokenSale' matches the contract name 'DesTokenSale', which means it is a constructor in older versions of Solidity (versions
            prior to 0.4.22). From Solidity version 0.4.22 onwards, the 'constructor' keyword is used to define a constructor, but in older versions, the constructor has
            the same name as the contract. As current syntax indicates, this function can be considered a constructor function.
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            Yes The provided code is a constructor because its name matches the contract name 'DesTokenSale'. This satisfies characteristic 1.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
