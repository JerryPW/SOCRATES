Function Security Analysis for MonkeyScam.determinePID(LDdatasets.EventReturns)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function determinePID.
    Check direct function security
        - function MonkeyScam.determinePID(LDdatasets.EventReturns) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not have any checks for specific roles like xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO associated with msg.sender in the form of require, if, throw,
          or assert statements.
        - function MonkeyScam.determinePID(LDdatasets.EventReturns) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not have any of the specified structures such as 'require(xxx == True);   xxx = False;' or equivalent. There are no consecutive statements
          modifying the same boolean variable after a check as described in the structures.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['buyXid', 'fallback', 'buyXaddr', 'buyXname']
        Function Security Analysis for MonkeyScam.buyXid(uint256)
            The modifier of function buyXid are ['isActivated', 'isHuman', 'isWithinLimits']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier isActivated has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier isActivated checks if a condition (activated_ == true) is met, but it does not enforce ownership or specific address execution, nor
                  does it implement a lock mechanism. It also does not have a suggestive name like Onlyxxx or nonReentrant.
                - modifier isHuman has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The function does not meet any of the specified characteristics: it does not enforce execution by a specific owner or address and does not use a
                  lock operation. The modifier checks that the sender is not a contract, as indicated by the extcodesize check, but this is not one of the specified
                  characteristics for outputting 'Yes'.
                - modifier isWithinLimits has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: None of the characteristics 1, 2 or 3 are met based on the provided code. The modifier only checks if the passed value is within certain limits
                  and does not restrict ownership access or implement a lock mechanism.
            Check direct function security
                - function MonkeyScam.buyXid(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not have any statement that specifically checks whether msg.sender is equal to or not equal to an
                  xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO. It processes tx event data and manages affiliate residuals without any such checks based on msg.sender.
                - function MonkeyScam.buyXid(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The function doesn't have 'require' or 'if' statements checking the boolean state and then changing the variable state as specified in the
                  conditions. Therefore, it doesn't contain the specified structures.
