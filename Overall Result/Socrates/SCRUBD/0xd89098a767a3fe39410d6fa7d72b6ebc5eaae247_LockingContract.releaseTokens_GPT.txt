Function Security Analysis for LockingContract.releaseTokens(address)
    The modifier of function releaseTokens are ['onlyWhenUnlocked']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier onlyWhenUnlocked has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The code in the modifier checks using '!isLocked()', which indicates a condition related to a lock. However, according to rule 2, both the lock
          operation (setting a flag to true) and unlock operation (resetting the flag to false) must be present to ensure that the function enters only once. In this code
          snippet, only the unlock condition is checked, without evidence of setting this lock to true within the function. Thus, it does not fully satisfy the necessary
          lock mechanism implied by rule 2.
