        Function Security Analysis for DividendDistributor.claimDividend()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function claimDividend.
            Check direct function security
                - function DividendDistributor.claimDividend() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function code does not have any checks that use the structures specified for msg.sender being compared to an owner or specific address. It
                  uses a function shouldDistribute(msg.sender) to check conditions for distribution eligibility, which does not match the listed patterns.
                - function DividendDistributor.claimDividend() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code doesn't satisfy any of the specified structures because there are no variable assignments or conditions with the require statement
                  matching the criteria.

        There are ['RewardToken'] should be checked in variable RewardToken
        Checked variables: RewardToken
            Yes The code provided is a constructor for the contract `DividendDistributor` because the function name is explicitly 'constructor'. In this constructor, the
            state variable `RewardToken` is assigned a value using the `_reflectionToken` parameter, which shows that it is being hardcoded in the sense that its initial
            value is being set directly in the constructor.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
