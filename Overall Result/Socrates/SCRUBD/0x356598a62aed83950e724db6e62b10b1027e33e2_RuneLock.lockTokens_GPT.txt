Function Security Analysis for RuneLock.lockTokens(address,uint256,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function lockTokens.
    Check direct function security
        - function RuneLock.lockTokens(address,uint256,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The provided function 'lockTokens' does not have any require/assert statements or conditional logic involving 'msg.sender' and a specific owner or
          leader role that match the required structures. It checks allowances, release time, and contract addresses, but none are related to sender's specific role
          checks that are ownership or leadership related.
        - function RuneLock.lockTokens(address,uint256,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures. It contains require statements and basic control flow, but none of the specific patterns
          requested are present.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['address(fee1Address).call{value:lockCost*98/100}()', 'address(fee2Address).call{value:lockCost*2/100}()',
    'token.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),_amountToLock)']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - address(fee1Address).call{value:lockCost*98/100}() ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - address(fee2Address).call{value:lockCost*2/100}() ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - token.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),_amountToLock) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['address(fee1Address).call{value:lockCost*98/100}()', 'address(fee2Address).call{value:lockCost*2/100}()',
    'token.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),_amountToLock)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['fee1Address'] should be checked in variable fee1Address
        Checked variables: fee1Address
            No The provided function, `updateFeeAddress`, is not a constructor since its name does not match the contract name `RuneLock`, nor is it explicitly named
            'constructor'. Additionally, the function does not hardcode the state variable `fee1Address`; instead, it updates it with the parameter `_newFeeAddress`
            during execution.
            Function Security Analysis for RuneLock.updateFeeAddress(address)
                The modifier of function updateFeeAddress are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The code contains 'require(msg.sender == owner);', which enforces that only the owner can execute the function. This matches characteristic
                      1 and there are no structural omissions in this part.
        There are ['fee2Address'] should be checked in variable fee2Address
        Checked variables: fee2Address
            State variable fee2Address has initialized in public area after declaration.
        The variable 'token' in external call 'token.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),_amountToLock)' has no state variable assigned. Therefore we check whether it
        has been hardcoded in the function.
            No The variable '_tokenAddress' is used as a function parameter that allows different values to be provided whenever the function is called, instead of being
            fixed within the function itself.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
