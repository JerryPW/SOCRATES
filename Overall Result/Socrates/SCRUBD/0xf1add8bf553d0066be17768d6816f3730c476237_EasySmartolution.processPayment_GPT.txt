Function Security Analysis for EasySmartolution.processPayment(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function processPayment.
    Check direct function security
        - function EasySmartolution.processPayment(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not include any restrictions or conditions based on the `msg.sender` value that involve checking it against an `xxxOwner`,
          `xxxAddress`, `Leader`, or `CEO`. There are no access control checks for the message sender matching or not matching a specific owner address.
        - function EasySmartolution.processPayment(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not contain any 'require' or 'if' checking a condition followed by setting a variable directly like in the specified structures.
          There is an 'if' statement, but it does not throw an exception or require any condition; it only checks the value of 'done'. Hence, none of the specified four
          structures are present in this code.

        - participant.processPayment.value(participant.daily())() ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['participant.processPayment.value(participant.daily())()']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['participants'] should be checked in variable participant
        Checked variables: participants
            No 1. The provided code does not include a constructor function, either explicitly named 'constructor' or having the same name as the contract
            'EasySmartolution'. Therefore, it does not satisfy characteristic 1.  2. The function involves operations with the state variable `participants` but does not
            hardcode any specific value into it. It performs checks and manipulations but does not set a hardcoded value directly for `participants`. Therefore, it does
            not satisfy characteristic 2 either.
            Function Security Analysis for EasySmartolution.addParticipant(address,address)
                There are no modifiers should be examined in function addParticipant.
                Check direct function security
                    - function EasySmartolution.addParticipant(address,address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                      Reason: The given code snippet does not contain any structure that involves checking if `msg.sender` is equal to or not equal to
                      xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO. It primarily involves checking conditions on participant registration and handling payments.
                    - function EasySmartolution.addParticipant(address,address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                      Reason: The given code does not include any of the specified patterns such as 'require(xxx == True)', 'require(xxx == False)', 'require(!xxx)', or
                      'if(!xxx) throw'. The require statements only check conditions on the values, and there are no assignments or reassignments of boolean variables
                      following these specific rules.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
