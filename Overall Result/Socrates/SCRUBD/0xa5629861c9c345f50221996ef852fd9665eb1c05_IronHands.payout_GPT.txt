Function Security Analysis for IronHands.payout()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function payout.
    Check direct function security
        - function IronHands.payout() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code doesn't check the identity of msg.sender against an owner or specific address.
        - function IronHands.payout() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code provided does not match any of the specified structures. The require statement checks for a condition (balance > 1) with no subsequent setting
          of the same variable to False or any equivalent adjustments elsewhere in the code.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['weak_hands.buy.value(investment).gas(1000000)(msg.sender)', 'participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.call.value(payoutToSend).gas(1000000)()']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - The gas limit in weak_hands.buy.value(investment).gas(1000000)(msg.sender) is 1000000, which is too high. Therefore, it will not prevent REE problem.
        - The gas limit in participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.call.value(payoutToSend).gas(1000000)() is 1000000, which is too high. Therefore, it will not prevent
        REE problem.
    Remaining external call: ['weak_hands.buy.value(investment).gas(1000000)(msg.sender)',
    'participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.call.value(payoutToSend).gas(1000000)()']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['weak_hands'] should be checked in variable weak_hands
        Checked variables: weak_hands
            Yes The function in the given code is a constructor, as indicated by it being explicitly named 'constructor'. Constructors automatically satisfy criterion 1.
        There are ['participants'] should be checked in variable participants
        Checked variables: participants
            No The provided code is not a constructor, as none of the function names ('deposit' and 'payout') match the contract name ('IronHands'), and neither are
            explicitly named 'constructor'. Additionally, the external call functions do not hardcode the state variable 'participants', as they only manipulate this
            variable programmatically by pushing new participants and modifying existing entries. There is no hardcoded assignment of a specific value or structure to
            'participants'.
            Function Security Analysis for IronHands.deposit()
                The modifier of function deposit are ['limitBuy']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier limitBuy has no relation with controlled by owner.
                      Reason: The modifier checks the transaction value limit but does not incorporate owner-only execution, specific addresses, or lock operations. It
                      primarily enforces a transfer value limitation, which does not satisfy any of the security-related characteristics mentioned.
                Check direct function security
                    - function IronHands.deposit() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                      Reason: The code does not contain any checks or assertions involving msg.sender specific to an ownership role, such as 'xxxOwner', 'xxxAddress',
                      'Leader', or 'CEO'. Hence, it does not match any of the specified structures.
                    - function IronHands.deposit() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                      Reason: The code does not contain any of the required structures where a variable is checked with require or if and then assigned a different value.
                      The require statement in the code is checking a condition involving 'msg.value', but it does not involve assigning any new value to 'msg.value' nor
                      is there any other statement matching the specific patterns given.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
