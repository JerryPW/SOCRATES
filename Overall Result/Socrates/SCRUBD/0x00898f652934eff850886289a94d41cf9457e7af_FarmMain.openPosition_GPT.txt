Function Security Analysis for FarmMain.openPosition(FarmingPositionRequest)
    The modifier of function openPosition are ['activeSetupOnly']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier activeSetupOnly has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier does not enforce owner-specific execution or a lock mechanism. It only checks if a particular setup is active and if the current block
          number is within a specified range. No patterns match the given rules.
    Check direct function security
        - function FarmMain.openPosition(FarmingPositionRequest) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures involving `msg.sender`.
        - function FarmMain.openPosition(FarmingPositionRequest) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not satisfy any of the described structures. It includes a 'require' statement, but it isn't followed by a reassignment of the
          variable checked by the 'require'.

Start analyze function: FarmMain._addLiquidity(uint256,FarmingPositionRequest)
Function Security Analysis for FarmMain._addLiquidity(uint256,FarmingPositionRequest)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _addLiquidity.
    Check direct function security
        - function FarmMain._addLiquidity(uint256,FarmingPositionRequest) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not check for msg.sender in any form that matches the specified structures.
        - function FarmMain._addLiquidity(uint256,FarmingPositionRequest) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not fit any of the required structures. It uses a require statement for checking conditions but doesn't involve setting a variable
          immediately after or matching the listed patterns (require with variable change or require followed by variable boolean assignment).
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['openPosition', 'addLiquidity']
        Function Security Analysis for FarmMain.openPosition(FarmingPositionRequest)
            The modifier of function openPosition are ['activeSetupOnly']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier activeSetupOnly has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: None of the provided rules are satisfied in the given modifier code. There are no owner/address checks nor lock operations, and the modifier
                  name does not suggest restricted access or non-reentrancy prevention.
            Check direct function security
                - function FarmMain.openPosition(FarmingPositionRequest) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code provided does not contain any of the specified structures related to 'msg.sender', such as require, if, or assert checks specifically
                  involving msg.sender against a defined owner or address role.
                - function FarmMain.openPosition(FarmingPositionRequest) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code does not include any of the specified structures, which involve requirements or conditions on the truth value of a boolean
                  variable with immediate changes to that variable.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['amm.addLiquidity(liquidityPoolData)', 'amm.addLiquidity{value:msg.value}(liquidityPoolData)']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - amm.addLiquidity(liquidityPoolData) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - amm.addLiquidity{value:msg.value}(liquidityPoolData) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['amm.addLiquidity(liquidityPoolData)', 'amm.addLiquidity{value:msg.value}(liquidityPoolData)']
    Analyze External Address
        The variable 'amm' in external call 'amm.addLiquidity(liquidityPoolData)' has no state variable assigned. Therefore we check whether it has been hardcoded in the
        function.
            No The variable `amm` is not hardcoded in the function. It is assigned the result of the call to `_transferToMeAndCheckAllowance`, which means that its value
            is determined at runtime based on the function's inputs and not a fixed, hardcoded value within the function code itself.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
