Function Security Analysis for VNETTokenPreSale.fallback()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
    Check direct function security
        - function VNETTokenPreSale.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not include any checks for msg.sender against specific addresses like xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO using require(), if(), or
          assert() as per the specified structures.
        - function VNETTokenPreSale.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not utilize boolean variables with 'require' or 'if(!xxx) throw' as specified in the stated structures.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['vnetToken.balanceOf(address(this))', 'msg.sender.transfer(weiAmount.sub(weiExpend))', 'vnetToken.transfer(msg.sender,vnetAmount)',
    'vnetToken.transfer(msg.sender,vnetBalance)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - msg.sender.transfer(weiAmount.sub(weiExpend)) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call
        'msg.sender.transfer(weiAmount.sub(weiExpend))' contains the '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - vnetToken.transfer(msg.sender,vnetAmount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - vnetToken.transfer(msg.sender,vnetBalance) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - vnetToken.balanceOf(address(this)) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - vnetToken.transfer(msg.sender,vnetAmount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - vnetToken.transfer(msg.sender,vnetBalance) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['vnetToken.balanceOf(address(this))', 'vnetToken.transfer(msg.sender,vnetAmount)', 'vnetToken.transfer(msg.sender,vnetBalance)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['vnetToken'] should be checked in variable vnetToken
        Checked variables: vnetToken
            Yes The provided code contains a constructor function, as it is explicitly labeled with the keyword 'constructor'. This marks it as the initialization
            function of the contract 'VNETTokenPreSale'.
        There are ['vnetToken'] should be checked in variable vnetToken
        Checked variables: vnetToken
            Yes The provided code snippet is a constructor because the function has the same name as the contract or uses the keyword 'constructor'. Therefore, it
            satisfies the first characteristic that identifies it as a constructor. Additionally, there is no hardcoding of the provided state variable 'vnetToken' within
            this snippet, as it is assigned a value from the input parameter.
        There are ['vnetToken'] should be checked in variable vnetToken
        Checked variables: vnetToken
            Yes The code snippet provided contains a constructor for the smart contract 'VNETTokenPreSale', as indicated by the use of the 'constructor' keyword. The
            constructor uses the state variable 'vnetToken' in its initialization, as seen in the line 'vnetToken = _vnetToken;'.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
