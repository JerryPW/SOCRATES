Start analyze function: EbyteDistribution.fallback()
Function Security Analysis for EbyteDistribution.fallback()
    The modifier of function fallback are ['onlyWhitelist', 'isUnlocked']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier onlyWhitelist has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier onlyWhitelist checks if msg.sender is not on the blacklist to allow function execution, but it doesn't enforce that only the owner or
          specific addresses can execute the function. Moreover, there is no lock operation observed.
        - modifier isUnlocked has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier isUnlocked() only checks if contractLocked is false (indicating an unlock), but it does not perform both a lock and unlock operation as
          required for rule 2. Therefore, it doesn't fully satisfy the criteria for rule 2 as the locking operation is not present.
    Check direct function security
        - function EbyteDistribution.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any checks or require/assert statements that involve msg.sender explicitly, nor does it check against an
          xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO variable as defined in the criteria.
        - function EbyteDistribution.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any 'require' statements with a condition of 'xxx == True' or 'xxx == False', nor does it contain any 'require(!xxx)' or
          'if(!xxx) throw' constructs with subsequent assignment to 'xxx'. Thus, none of the specified patterns are present in the provided function.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['ebyteToken.transfer(investor,toGiveT)', 'ebyteToken.transfer(investor,toGiveE)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - ebyteToken.transfer(investor,toGiveT) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - ebyteToken.transfer(investor,toGiveE) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - ebyteToken.transfer(investor,toGiveT) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - ebyteToken.transfer(investor,toGiveE) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['ebyteToken.transfer(investor,toGiveT)', 'ebyteToken.transfer(investor,toGiveE)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['ebyteToken'] should be checked in variable ebyteToken
        Checked variables: ebyteToken
            Yes The function name matches the contract name 'EbyteDistribution', indicating that this is a constructor. Constructors initialize contracts and have the
            same name as the contract, allowing this function to also potentially set initial state variables such as 'ebyteToken'. Therefore, based on point 1, the
            function satisfies the criteria of being a constructor.
        There are ['ebyteToken'] should be checked in variable ebyteToken
        Checked variables: ebyteToken
            Yes The provided code is a constructor because the function name 'EbyteDistribution' matches the contract name. Constructors are special functions called once
            during the deployment of the contract to set initial values for the state variables. In this case, the constructor is used to initialize 'ebyteToken' and
            'owner'. This satisfies the first characteristic for the external call function to be marked as 'Yes'.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: EbyteDistribution.getTokenBalance(address)
Function Security Analysis for EbyteDistribution.getTokenBalance(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function getTokenBalance.
    Check direct function security
        - function EbyteDistribution.getTokenBalance(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the mentioned security structures checking the identity of msg.sender against any Owner or Leader addresses.
        - function EbyteDistribution.getTokenBalance(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any 'require' statements or if-throw structures with assignments that match the given patterns.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['ebyteToken.balanceOf(who)']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - ebyteToken.balanceOf(who) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['ebyteToken.balanceOf(who)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['ebyteToken'] should be checked in variable ebyteToken
        Checked variables: ebyteToken
            Yes 1. The function name matches the contract name 'EbyteDistribution'. This implies that it could be a constructor according to characteristic 1.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
