Function Security Analysis for Nothing.mintNOTHING(uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function mintNOTHING.
    Check direct function security
        - function Nothing.mintNOTHING(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not check for msg.sender against an owner or administrative address using require, if, or assert statements with or without logical
          operators. It only checks general sale conditions and minting limits.
        - function Nothing.mintNOTHING(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the structures outlined in the conditions. It has `require` statements, but none of them are followed by
          assignments to a boolean variable fulfilling the described structures.

Function Security Analysis for ERC721._safeMint(address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _safeMint.
    Check direct function security
        - function ERC721._safeMint(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any requirement or conditional check involving 'msg.sender'.
        - function ERC721._safeMint(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function does not contain any require statements or logical structures that match the specified patterns. Those patterns involve setting a boolean
          variable based on a condition, which isn't present in this function.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['mintNOTHING']
        Function Security Analysis for Nothing.mintNOTHING(uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function mintNOTHING.
            Check direct function security
                - function Nothing.mintNOTHING(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The given code does not contain any of the specified structures involving msg.sender.
                - function Nothing.mintNOTHING(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code does not fit any of the structures described in the conditions. There are no statements with the pattern 'require(xxx ==
                  True)', 'require(xxx == False)', and no statements that throw an exception based on 'if(!xxx)'. Also, the modification of xxx from false to true or true
                  to false does not occur between the require and after a logical condition.

Start analyze function: ERC721._checkOnERC721Received(address,address,uint256,bytes)
Function Security Analysis for ERC721._checkOnERC721Received(address,address,uint256,bytes)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _checkOnERC721Received.
    Check direct function security
        - function ERC721._checkOnERC721Received(address,address,uint256,bytes) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The provided function does not perform any checks related to `msg.sender` being equal to or not equal to any specified address/role like xxxOwner,
          xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO. It only involves calling a function and checking if the contract address can handle ERC721 tokens.
        - function ERC721._checkOnERC721Received(address,address,uint256,bytes) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures. It only consists of an if statement that checks if an address is not a contract and then
          returns true. The remaining part of the function executes a function call and checks a return value but does not modify the state of a variable with a require
          statement or throw an exception in the specified manner.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['_safeTransfer', 'safeTransferFrom', '_safeMint', 'mintNOTHING', 'safeTransferFrom', '_safeMint']
        Function Security Analysis for ERC721._safeTransfer(address,address,uint256,bytes)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function _safeTransfer.
            Check direct function security
                - function ERC721._safeTransfer(address,address,uint256,bytes) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures relating to 'msg.sender'. It deals with internal logic related to token transfer
                  and receiver checking without involving a specific sender ownership or authority check.
                - function ERC721._safeTransfer(address,address,uint256,bytes) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The function contains a require statement but does not alter the value of any variable in the form of setting a boolean variable to true/false
                  as required by the structures.
            Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

                        - function ERC721.safeTransferFrom(address,address,uint256,bytes) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                          Reason: The code does not contain any conditional checks for msg.sender against Owner/Leader/CEO addresses directly as per the specified
                          structures.
                        - function ERC721.safeTransferFrom(address,address,uint256,bytes) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                          Reason: The code does not satisfy any of the provided structures. It contains a require statement for `_isApprovedOrOwner` but does not contain
                          a matching assignment statement to the same variable before or after the require.

    Analyze External Address
        The variable 'to' in external call 'to.functionCall(abi.encodeWithSelector(IERC721Receiver(to).onERC721Received.selector,_msgSender(),from,tokenId,_data),ERC721:t
        ransfertononERC721Receiverimplementer)' has no state variable assigned in ERC721._checkOnERC721Received(address,address,uint256,bytes). Considering that it is an
        internal/private function, we analyze the function inputs.
        Analyze External Address
            The variable 'to' in external call 'to' has no state variable assigned in ERC721._safeTransfer(address,address,uint256,bytes). Considering that it is an
            internal/private function, we analyze the function inputs.
            Analyze External Address
                The variable 'to' in external call 'to' has no state variable assigned in ERC721.safeTransferFrom(address,address,uint256,bytes). Therefore we check
                whether it has been hardcoded in the function.
                    No The variable 'to' in the function safeTransferFrom is a function parameter and is not hardcoded within the function body, as it is used to
                    determine the recipient of a token transfer during execution.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
