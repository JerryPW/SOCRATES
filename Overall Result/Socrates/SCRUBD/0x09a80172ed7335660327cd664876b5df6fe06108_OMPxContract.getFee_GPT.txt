Function Security Analysis for OMPxContract.getFee()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function getFee.
    Check direct function security
        - function OMPxContract.getFee() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not include any condition or assertion that directly checks if msg.sender is an owner, address, or similar role, nor a check that throws
          or performs an action if such a condition is not met.
        - function OMPxContract.getFee() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided function does not match any of the specified structures. It contains an if statement checking a condition (if(feeBalance > 1e15)), but it
          does not have a 'require(xxx == True)', 'require(xxx == False)', 'require(!xxx)', or 'if(!xxx) throw' condition followed by 'xxx = True' or 'xxx = False'.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['feeReceiverContract.receiveFunds.value(feeBalance).gas(150000)()']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - The gas limit in feeReceiverContract.receiveFunds.value(feeBalance).gas(150000)() is 150000, which is too high. Therefore, it will not prevent REE problem.
    Remaining external call: ['feeReceiverContract.receiveFunds.value(feeBalance).gas(150000)()']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['feeReceiverContract'] should be checked in variable feeReceiverContract
        Checked variables: feeReceiverContract
            No The provided function code is setting a new value to the state variable 'feeReceiverContract' through an external call 'feeReceiverContract =
            Distribution(newReceiver)'. However, the function is designed to update the state variable dynamically based on the input parameter 'newReceiver' and is not
            using a hardcoded address for this state variable. Furthermore, the function name 'setFeeReceiver' does not match the contract name 'OMPxContract', nor is it
            explicitly named as 'constructor'. Therefore, this function neither matches the constructor criterion nor the hardcoding criterion for the state variable.
            Function Security Analysis for OMPxContract.setFeeReceiver(address)
                The modifier of function setFeeReceiver are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: Upon re-evaluating the modifier onlyOwner, the code contains require(msg.sender == owner);, which enforces ownership access control. This
                      satisfies criterion 1, as it checks if the function is restricted to the owner, thereby prohibiting unauthorized access.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
