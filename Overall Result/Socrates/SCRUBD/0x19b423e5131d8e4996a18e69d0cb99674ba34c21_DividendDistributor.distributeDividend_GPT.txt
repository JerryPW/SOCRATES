Function Security Analysis for DividendDistributor.distributeDividend(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function distributeDividend.
    Check direct function security
        - function DividendDistributor.distributeDividend(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any access control checks involving msg.sender.
        - function DividendDistributor.distributeDividend(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures such as require statements with specific conditions or conditional throwing followed
          by assignments. The code primarily checks if the amount of shares is zero and returns immediately, or calculates an unpaid amount and makes a transfer if it's
          greater than zero. None of this matches the required patterns.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['setShare', 'claimDividend', 'process']
        Function Security Analysis for DividendDistributor.setShare(address,uint256)
            The modifier of function setShare are ['onlyToken']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyToken is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The judgment is based on rule 1, which requires the presence of a check enforcing that only specific addresses can execute the function. The
                  modifier contains 'require(msg.sender == _token);', enforcing that only the specific address stored in the _token variable (likely representing a
                  particular permission or ownership role) can access the function. This is a straightforward application of rule 1, with no structural omissions as only
                  one statement is needed to satisfy the condition of allowing only specific addresses to interact.
        Function Security Analysis for DividendDistributor.claimDividend()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function claimDividend.
            Check direct function security
                - function DividendDistributor.claimDividend() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain any checks on msg.sender against specific roles such as xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO.
                - function DividendDistributor.claimDividend() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any form of 'require' statement or 'if' condition that checks a variable and then changes that variable's state as
                  described in the structures. It solely calls another function.

        - rewardToken.transfer(shareholder,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - rewardToken.transfer(shareholder,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['rewardToken.transfer(shareholder,amount)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['rewardToken'] should be checked in variable rewardToken
        Checked variables: rewardToken
            Yes The provided code defines a constructor for the contract 'DividendDistributor'. This is identified by the function name 'constructor', which matches one
            of the characteristics to check.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
