        - function DividendDistributor.distributeDividend(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code provided does not contain any 'require' statements or the exact structure mentioned in the criteria. - There is a conditional check (if) on
          'shares[shareholder].amount', but it only returns and does not throw an exception or set the variable to False or True. - The overall structure doesn't fit any
          of the four described patterns.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

                  Reason: The function 'claimDividend' does not have any require statement nor it is assigning any variable with true or false values as per the given
                  structures.
