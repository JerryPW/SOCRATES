Start analyze function: Brave3d.withdraw()
Function Security Analysis for Brave3d.withdraw()
    The modifier of function withdraw are ['hasEarnings']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier hasEarnings has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier does not enforce ownership check or specific address execution, nor does it contain a typical lock operation to prevent reentrancy. It
          checks a condition related to the sender's earnings.
    Check direct function security
        - function Brave3d.withdraw() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not include any statement that matches the described structures in terms of checking msg.sender against a specified owner or address.
        - function Brave3d.withdraw() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures. There are no require statements or if conditions as outlined in the characteristics
          to check or throw errors based on a variable `xxx`. The function simply performs some operations and state changes.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['msg.sender.transfer(amount)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - msg.sender.transfer(amount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the
        '.transfer(' keyword, which satisfies the first characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: Brave3d.overStage(uint8)
Function Security Analysis for Brave3d.overStage(uint8)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function overStage.
    Check direct function security
        - function Brave3d.overStage(uint8) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function code provided does not contain any 'msg.sender' checks or assertions against specific roles such as 'xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO'.
        - function Brave3d.overStage(uint8) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code contains the statements assert(!finishStage.isFinish); and finishStage.isFinish = true; from structure 3. However, after checking, they do not
          perform a state negation operation immediately after the require as there is a significant amount of logic between the two statements. Therefore, it does not
          fully satisfy the requirement for immediate negation after checking the state.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['buyFromValue', 'setName', 'withdraw', 'buyByAddress', 'forceOverStage', 'buyByName']
        Function Security Analysis for Brave3d.buyFromValue(uint8)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function buyFromValue.
            Check direct function security
                - function Brave3d.buyFromValue(uint8) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not check msg.sender against any ownership or specific address conditions that involve xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO as required
                  in the specified structures.
                - function Brave3d.buyFromValue(uint8) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any structure that matches the given patterns.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['p3dContract.withdraw()', 'p3dContract.buy.value(P3D_VALUE*rate)(address(OFFICIAL_P3D))', 'p3dContract.myDividends(true)']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - p3dContract.withdraw() ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - p3dContract.buy.value(P3D_VALUE*rate)(address(OFFICIAL_P3D)) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - p3dContract.myDividends(true) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['p3dContract.withdraw()', 'p3dContract.buy.value(P3D_VALUE*rate)(address(OFFICIAL_P3D))', 'p3dContract.myDividends(true)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['p3dContract'] should be checked in variable p3dContract
        Checked variables: p3dContract
            State variable p3dContract has initialized in public area after declaration.
        There are ['p3dContract'] should be checked in variable p3dContract
        Checked variables: p3dContract
            State variable p3dContract has initialized in public area after declaration.
        There are ['p3dContract'] should be checked in variable p3dContract
        Checked variables: p3dContract
            State variable p3dContract has initialized in public area after declaration.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
