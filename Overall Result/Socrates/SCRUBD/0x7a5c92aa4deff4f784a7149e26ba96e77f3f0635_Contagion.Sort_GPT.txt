External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['owner.send(feecounter)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - owner.send(feecounter) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains '.send(' keyword..
        Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
