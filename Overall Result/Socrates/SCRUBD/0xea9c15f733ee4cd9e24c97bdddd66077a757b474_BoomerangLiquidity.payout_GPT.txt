Function Security Analysis for BoomerangLiquidity.payout()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function payout.
    Check direct function security
        - function BoomerangLiquidity.payout() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any checks related to `msg.sender` matching specific role-based addresses such as `xxxOwner`, `xxxAddress`, `Leader`,
          `CEO`. Hence, it does not match the given structures.
        - function BoomerangLiquidity.payout() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code doesn't match any of the specified structures. It uses 'require(balance > 1)', but it doesn't change the value of 'balance' to True or
          False directly after that condition. The function proceeds with calculations and send operations rather than setting a boolean variable to True or False
          directly based on a require condition.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.call.value(payoutToSend).gas(1000000)()', 'flmContract.call.value(investment).gas(1000000)()',
    'participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.send(payoutToSend)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.send(payoutToSend) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The
        external call 'participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.send(payoutToSend)' contains the '.send(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - The gas limit in participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.call.value(payoutToSend).gas(1000000)() is 1000000, which is too high. Therefore, it will not prevent
        REE problem.
        - The gas limit in flmContract.call.value(investment).gas(1000000)() is 1000000, which is too high. Therefore, it will not prevent REE problem.
    Remaining external call: ['participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.call.value(payoutToSend).gas(1000000)()', 'flmContract.call.value(investment).gas(1000000)()']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['participants'] should be checked in variable participants
        Checked variables: participants
            No The function provided is named 'payout', which does not match the contract name 'BoomerangLiquidity' and is not explicitly named 'constructor'. Thus, it is
            not a constructor. The code contains a state variable 'participants', which is used in a calculation or operation. However, there is no indication of
            'participants' being hardcoded (e.g., there are no fixed values like constants directly assigned to the state within the calls). The function manipulates the
            state variable's values but does not hardcode it within its code explicitly. Therefore, neither condition for 'Yes' is satisfied.
            Function Security Analysis for BoomerangLiquidity.deposit()
                There are no modifiers should be examined in function deposit.
                Check direct function security
                    - function BoomerangLiquidity.deposit() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                      Reason: The function 'deposit' does not contain any structure mentioned in the criteria for checking the msg.sender against any owner, address,
                      Leader, or CEO entity.
                    - function BoomerangLiquidity.deposit() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                      Reason: The provided code does not exhibit any of the specified structures that would allow the function to output 'Yes'. It lacks any use of the
                      'require' or 'if' statements which are key to meeting the criteria.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
