    There are no modifiers should be examined in function POOL1_unstake.
    Check direct function security
        - function GFarm.POOL1_unstake(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not use any verification check related to 'msg.sender' equaling any specific owner or leader address.
        - function GFarm.POOL1_unstake(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures. It contains 'require()' statements, but they do not follow the required pattern of setting a
          variable before or after the check. Similarly, there are no assignments to 'xxx = true/false' variable patterns after the 'require' similar to the
          aforementioned structures.

        Checked variables: lp
            No The function provided is named 'set_LP', which does not match the contract name 'GFarm', nor is it explicitly named 'constructor'. Therefore, it is not a
            constructor.   Furthermore, the function does not hardcode a state variable. Instead, it checks whether 'lp' is equal to 'IUniswapV2Pair(0)', but does not set
            'lp' to a hardcoded value. Instead, 'lp' is set to 'IUniswapV2Pair(_lp)', which depends on the input parameter and not on a hardcoded constant.  Since neither
            characteristic is satisfied, the output is 'No'.
            Function Security Analysis for GFarm.set_LP(address)
                The modifier of function set_LP are ['onlyGov']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyGov is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The code contains 'require(msg.sender == GOVERNANCE);', which matches the first characteristic: enforcing that only a specific address
                      (GOVERNANCE) can execute the function. This satisfies the requirement of the first rule without any structural omissions.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

    Check direct function security
        - function GFarm.POOL1_update() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not include any checks or conditions involving `msg.sender`. It focuses on updating rewards in a liquidity pool without specific owner or
          address-based access control logic.
        - function GFarm.POOL1_update() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain the structures specified that involve 'require' statements changing a variable or 'if-throw' constructions with the same
          variable getting reassigned or checked. Thus, none of the patterns are matched.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

                - function GFarm.POOL1_unstake(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code snippet does not contain any of the required structures. The 'require' statements present do not involve a boolean variable being
                  switched between True and False or vice versa. They simply check conditions on numerical variables without any subsequent reassignment of those
                  conditions.

        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            No The function provided is named 'set_TOKEN' which does not match the contract name 'GFarm', nor is it explicitly named 'constructor'. Therefore, it's not a
            constructor.  Regarding the second condition, the state variable 'token' is not hardcoded in the function. It is being set with user-provided input '_token'
            after a check, so it doesn't satisfy the condition for a hardcoded state variable.  Therefore, this function does not satisfy either of the given
            characteristics.
            Function Security Analysis for GFarm.set_TOKEN(address)
                The modifier of function set_TOKEN are ['onlyGov']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyGov is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: Rule 1: The modifier uses 'require(msg.sender == GOVERNANCE);' to ensure the function can only be executed by the address stored in
                      GOVERNANCE, verifying only the given entity can run the function.
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            No The function 'set_TOKEN' is not a constructor as its name does not match the contract name 'GFarm' and it is not explicitly named 'constructor'.
            Additionally, the function does not hardcode the state variable 'token'; instead, it sets 'token' to an address passed as a parameter '_token'. Hence, it does
            not satisfy either condition.
            Function Security Analysis for GFarm.set_TOKEN(address)
                The modifier of function set_TOKEN are ['onlyGov']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyGov is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The answer remains the same as before. The statement require(msg.sender == GOVERNANCE); enforces that only the address defined as GOVERNANCE
                      can execute the function, satisfying the first characteristic. No other relevant structures or checks, such as lock operations, are present in the
                      provided code.
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            No The function set_TOKEN is not a constructor because it doesn't match the contract name 'GFarm', nor is it explicitly named 'constructor'. Additionally, the
            function does not hardcode the state variable 'token' since it updates 'token' based on the input parameter '_token'. Therefore, none of the characteristics
            are satisfied.
            Function Security Analysis for GFarm.set_TOKEN(address)
                The modifier of function set_TOKEN are ['onlyGov']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyGov is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The modifier uses `require(msg.sender == GOVERNANCE);` which enforces that only the GOVERNANCE address can execute the function. This
                      clearly matches rule 1 by restricting execution to a specific address. There are no structural omissions regarding multiple conditions or additional
                      checks since it directly matches one of the criteria for rule 1.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

            No The provided function `set_TOKEN` is not a constructor because its name does not match the contract name `GFarm` and it is not explicitly named
            'constructor'. Additionally, the function does not hardcode the state variable `token`, as it receives an input address `_token` to set the state variable
            `token`. Therefore, the function satisfies neither characteristic.
            Function Security Analysis for GFarm.set_TOKEN(address)
                The modifier of function set_TOKEN are ['onlyGov']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyGov is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The modifier onlyGov enforces that only the GOVERNANCE address can execute the function, as evidenced by the statement 'require(msg.sender
                      == GOVERNANCE);'. This matches characteristic 1 of the criteria. There are no structures related to lock operation for characteristic 2 in the
                      provided code, and the modifier's name also suggests restricted access, conforming to characteristic 1.
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            No The provided code is for the function 'set_TOKEN', which is not a constructor. The function's name does not match the contract name 'GFarm', and it is not
            explicitly named 'constructor'. Additionally, the state variable 'token' is not hardcoded; it is being set based on the input '_token', with a requirement
            check that the initial 'token' value should be zero (i.e., not yet set). Hence, none of the characteristics are satisfied.
            Function Security Analysis for GFarm.set_TOKEN(address)
                The modifier of function set_TOKEN are ['onlyGov']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyGov is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The code in the modifier enforces that only the GOVERNANCE address can execute the function by using require(msg.sender == GOVERNANCE). This
                      satisfies rule 1.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
