Function Security Analysis for InstaDice.roll(uint8)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function roll.
    Check direct function security
        - function InstaDice.roll(uint8) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any explicit checks where msg.sender is compared to specific owner or leader variables like xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader,
          or CEO. It doesn't use any of the structures defined in the prompt.
        - function InstaDice.roll(uint8) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: None of the structures (1-4) involving a require or if statement with a conditional check and variable assignments as specified in the problem are
          present in the code.

Start analyze function: InstaDice._finalizePreviousRoll(InstaDice.User,InstaDice.Stats)
Function Security Analysis for InstaDice._finalizePreviousRoll(InstaDice.User,InstaDice.Stats)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _finalizePreviousRoll.
    Check direct function security
        - function InstaDice._finalizePreviousRoll(InstaDice.User,InstaDice.Stats) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code lacks any direct checks or assertions involving 'msg.sender' being compared to a variable that implies ownership, address, or leadership roles
          like 'Owner', 'Address', 'Leader', or 'CEO'.
        - function InstaDice._finalizePreviousRoll(InstaDice.User,InstaDice.Stats) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures of the form require(xxx == True or False) followed by xxx = False or True, nor does it contain
          if(!xxx) throw; followed by xxx = true.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['roll', 'payoutPreviousRoll']
        Function Security Analysis for InstaDice.roll(uint8)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function roll.
            Check direct function security
                - function InstaDice.roll(uint8) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain any logic that checks whether msg.sender equals or does not equal any specific owner or privileged role within
                  require(), if(), or assert() statements. There are no conditions or restrictions using msg.sender for a specific owner or privileged role, like
                  xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
                - function InstaDice.roll(uint8) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The given code does not contain any 'require' or 'if(!xxx)throw' structure that matches the given options. The 'if' conditions and their
                  corresponding actions do not include setting any variable to 'True' or 'False' that follows the specific structures within the criteria.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['msg.sender.call.value(_user.r_payout)()']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - msg.sender.call.value(_user.r_payout)() ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['msg.sender.call.value(_user.r_payout)()']
    Analyze External Address
        External call msg.sender.call.value(_user.r_payout)() calls msg.sender, which consider potential REE problem.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
