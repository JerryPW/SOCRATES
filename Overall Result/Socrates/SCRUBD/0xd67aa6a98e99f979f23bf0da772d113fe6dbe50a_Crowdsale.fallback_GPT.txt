    Analyze Transfer
        - tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,amount/price) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - beneficiary.send(amountRaised) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        'beneficiary.send(amountRaised)' contains '.send(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,amount/price) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,amount/price)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['tokenReward'] should be checked in variable tokenReward
        Checked variables: tokenReward
            Yes 1. The function is named 'Crowdsale', which matches the contract name. This indicates that it is likely a constructor function. 2. The function does
            hardcode the 'tokenReward' state variable by setting it to 'token(addressOfTokenUsedAsReward)', although this is dynamically determined by the function
            argument and not a hardcoded literal value.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
