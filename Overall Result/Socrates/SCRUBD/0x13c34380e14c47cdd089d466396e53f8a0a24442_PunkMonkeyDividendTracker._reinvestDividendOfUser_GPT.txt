Function Security Analysis for PunkMonkeyDividendTracker._reinvestDividendOfUser(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _reinvestDividendOfUser.
    Check direct function security
        - function PunkMonkeyDividendTracker._reinvestDividendOfUser(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any checks involving msg.sender against an xxxOwner or similar privileged roles as described in the listed patterns.
        - function PunkMonkeyDividendTracker._reinvestDividendOfUser(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code contains an if (!success) throw equivalent pattern. The 'success' variable is used, but it does not meet the exact required structural patterns
          that involve 'require' or 'if(!xxx) throw'. Thus, it doesn't satisfy any specified structure.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['processAccount', 'process']
        Function Security Analysis for PunkMonkeyDividendTracker.processAccount(address,bool)
            The modifier of function processAccount are ['onlyOwner']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The modifier onlyOwner contains a require statement: require(_owner == _msgSender()), which ensures that only the owner can execute the
                  function. It matches the structure described in rule 1, thus confirming the answer.
        Function Security Analysis for PunkMonkeyDividendTracker.process(uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function process.
            Check direct function security
                - function PunkMonkeyDividendTracker.process(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any statements that check the identity of the message sender using msg.sender. It neither restricts access based
                  on the sender's address nor performs any actions based on msg.sender.
                - function PunkMonkeyDividendTracker.process(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any 'require' or 'if' statements in the outlined structures.

    Analyze External Address
        There are ['PunkMonkeyContract'] should be checked in variable PunkMonkeyContract
        Checked variables: PunkMonkeyContract
            Yes The function provided is a constructor because it is named 'constructor', which explicitly matches one of the criteria for identifying a constructor in a
            smart contract.
        There are ['uniswapV2Router'] should be checked in variable uniswapV2Router
        Checked variables: uniswapV2Router
            Yes The provided code includes a constructor because the first function is explicitly named 'constructor'.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
