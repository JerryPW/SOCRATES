    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _transferFrom.
    Check direct function security
        - function PepeBonk._transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The provided code does not have any conditions or assertions that check if `msg.sender` equals or does not equal xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO. It
          focuses on transaction limits, balances, and dividend sharing without owner-specific conditions. Hence, none of the specified characteristics are met.
        - function PepeBonk._transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code contains a commented segment that would fit the fourth type if it were uncommented: 'if(!launched()) throw;' would effectively be the same as
          'require(!launched())' followed by 'launch()', which sets launched to true, fitting the conditions in structure 4. However, since the implementation context
          (the effect of 'launch()') must be considered and the statement is commented, none of the active code fits the criteria.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transferFrom', 'transfer']
        Function Security Analysis for PepeBonk.transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transferFrom.
            Check direct function security
                - function PepeBonk.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: There is no check related to msg.sender being xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO in the code.
                - function PepeBonk.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The given code snippet does not contain any 'require' or 'if' structures that meet the specified patterns. Specifically, there's no 'require' or
                  'if' statement that checks a boolean variable and then changes that variable's state within the specified structure.

    Analyze External Address
        There are ['distributor'] should be checked in variable distributor
        Checked variables: distributor
            Yes The provided code is a constructor for the contract PepeBonk. The function is explicitly named 'constructor', satisfying the first condition of the rules.
            Additionally, the state variable `distributor` is hardcoded by assigning it a new instance of `DividendDistributor(_dexRouter)` which does not satisfy the
            second condition as the external function itself does not hardcode the state variable. Thus, it satisfies the rules based on being a constructor.
        There are ['distributor'] should be checked in variable distributor
        Checked variables: distributor
            Yes The function provided is a constructor because it is explicitly named 'constructor'. Constructors are special functions used during contract deployment,
            so they inherently either initialize the contract with hardcoded state variables or set initial values. In this case, the function initializes the contract
            with certain setup instructions, which typically include setting or configuring state variables during the contract's deployment. While it does set up the
            'distributor' state variable using 'new DividendDistributor(_dexRouter)', this alone doesn't qualify as hardcoding, but its nature as a constructor meets the
            criteria provided.
        There are ['distributor'] should be checked in variable distributor
        Checked variables: distributor
            Yes The provided code includes a function named 'constructor', which matches the second scenario where a function is explicitly named 'constructor'.
            Therefore, the function is indeed a constructor.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: PepeBonk.swapBack()
Function Security Analysis for PepeBonk.swapBack()
    The modifier of function swapBack are ['swapping']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier swapping is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The code uses a lock operation, setting the flag 'inSwap' to true before the function runs and resetting it to false afterward. Both lock (inSwap =
          true) and unlock (inSwap = false) operations are present, satisfying rule 2 completely without structural omissions.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: PepeBonk.triggerAutoBuyback()
Function Security Analysis for PepeBonk.triggerAutoBuyback()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function triggerAutoBuyback.
    Check direct function security
        - function PepeBonk.triggerAutoBuyback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures that involve checking msg.sender against xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
        - function PepeBonk.triggerAutoBuyback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not contain any 'require' or 'if' statements that check the value of a variable and then change it as per the specified structures.
          So it does not match any of the conditions provided for outputting 'Yes'.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transferFrom', 'transfer', '_transferFrom']
        Function Security Analysis for PepeBonk.transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transferFrom.
            Check direct function security
                - function PepeBonk.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not check the identity of msg.sender against any specified owner, address, leader, or CEO.
                - function PepeBonk.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain a 'require(xxx == True)', 'require(xxx == False)', 'require(!xxx)', or 'if(!xxx) throw' statement followed by a change
                  to the same variable within the same function.

Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: PepeBonk.buyTokens(uint256,address)
Function Security Analysis for PepeBonk.buyTokens(uint256,address)
    The modifier of function buyTokens are ['swapping']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier swapping is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The modifier sets 'inSwap' to true before the function execution and resets it to false afterward. This matches the requirement for a lock operation
          where a flag is toggled at the beginning and end of the function to ensure it's executed only once at any given time.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
