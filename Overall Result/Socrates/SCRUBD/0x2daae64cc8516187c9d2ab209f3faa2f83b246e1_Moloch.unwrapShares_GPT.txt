Function Security Analysis for Moloch.unwrapShares(uint256)
    The modifier of function unwrapShares are ['nonReentrant']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier nonReentrant is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The nonReentrant modifier uses a lock mechanism to prevent reentrancy by setting a status flag. Specifically, it checks if _status is not equal to
          _ENTERED (require(_status != _ENTERED)), then sets _status to _ENTERED before the function execution, and resets it to _NOT_ENTERED after execution. This
          satisfies both lock and unlock operations as per rule 2. Thus, it is correct to judge based on rule 2.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
