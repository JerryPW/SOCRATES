Function Security Analysis for FitCoin.addLiquidity()
    The modifier of function addLiquidity are ['onlyOwner']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: Upon reviewing the code, the `modifier onlyOwner` contains a requirement that checks if `_msgSender()` (equivalent to `msg.sender` functionally) is
          equal to `m_Owner`. This aligns with characteristic #1, where the function enforces that only the owner or specific addresses can execute the function. There
          are no structural omissions observed in characteristic #1, as the code explicitly uses `require` for validation. There is no evidence of characteristic #2
          (lock/unlock operation) in this modifier.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
