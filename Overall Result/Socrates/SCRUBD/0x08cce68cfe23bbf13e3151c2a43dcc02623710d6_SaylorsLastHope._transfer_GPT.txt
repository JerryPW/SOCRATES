Function Security Analysis for SaylorsLastHope._transfer(address,address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _transfer.
    Check direct function security
        - function SaylorsLastHope._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code contains a check where 'msg.sender' is compared to a variable to determine behavior, specifically in the line: if(msg.sender != pair ...).
          However, the variable 'pair' does not represent an owner or leader, and 'owner' is not checked against 'msg.sender'. Thus, the structure does not match any of
          the required patterns as per the specified conditions.
        - function SaylorsLastHope._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code contains a `require(!bots[sender] && !bots[recipient]);` statement, but it does not change 'bots' variable to 'True' or 'False', therefore it
          doesn't match any of the given structural conditions.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transferFrom', 'transfer']
        Function Security Analysis for SaylorsLastHope.transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transferFrom.
            Check direct function security
                - function SaylorsLastHope.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code checks the allowance and performs a transfer but does not include conditions about the msg.sender being a specific owner or leader type
                  address.
                - function SaylorsLastHope.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the structures specified: neither requirement checks (require statements) nor exception handling structures
                  (like throw) are present, which are necessary conditions based on the specified characteristics.

        - moneyPrinter.setShare(sender,_balances[sender]) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - moneyPrinter.setShare(recipient,_balances[recipient]) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['moneyPrinter.setShare(sender,_balances[sender])', 'moneyPrinter.setShare(recipient,_balances[recipient])']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['moneyPrinter'] should be checked in variable moneyPrinter
        Checked variables: moneyPrinter
            Yes The function in the provided code is explicitly named 'constructor', which matches the typical naming pattern for a constructor in Solidity. The
            constructor does not have any hardcoded state variables named 'moneyPrinter', but it does instantiate a new object of 'MoneyPrinter'. Since the function is
            explicitly named 'constructor', it satisfies the first characteristic.
        There are ['moneyPrinter'] should be checked in variable moneyPrinter
        Checked variables: moneyPrinter
            Yes The provided code is a constructor because the function name matches the keyword 'constructor'.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: SaylorsLastHope.swapBack()
Function Security Analysis for SaylorsLastHope.swapBack()
    The modifier of function swapBack are ['lockTheSwap']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier lockTheSwap is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: This modifier includes both a lock operation, where `inSwapAndLiquify` is set to true before the function runs, and an unlock operation, where
          `inSwapAndLiquify` is reset to false afterward. This fits the structure required for rule 2, indicating a lock mechanism is present.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
