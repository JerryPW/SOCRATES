Function Security Analysis for GET111.pay()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function pay.
    Check direct function security
        - function GET111.pay() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures involving msg.sender.
        - function GET111.pay() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not contain any of the specified structures such as 'require(some_var == True)', 'require(some_var == False)', 'require(!some_var)',
          or 'if(!some_var) throw' followed by setting the same variable to True or False as described in the provided patterns.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['fallback']
        Function Security Analysis for GET111.fallback()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
            Check direct function security
                - function GET111.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code provided does not include any of the specified structures related to checking the identity of msg.sender against an owner, address,
                  leader, or CEO. It involves checks on msg.value and gasleft(), but none that assert the caller's identity as required.
                - function GET111.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures with matching variable and patterns.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['dep.depositor.send(dep.expect)', 'dep.depositor.send(money)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - dep.depositor.send(dep.expect) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains '.send('
        keyword, which matches the characteristics specified.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - dep.depositor.send(money) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains '.send('
        keyword, which matches the characteristics specified.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
