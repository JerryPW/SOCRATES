          xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO.
        - function VestingContractABX.transfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures.  - There is a requirement with a condition, but the follow-up statements do not change or
          reset a variable as described in the characteristic structures. - No logical negation or equality check followed by an assignment to that variable matching the
          specified pattern. - No use of 'require' with a simple boolean variable that changes this way, nor is there an 'if' with a boolean negation and throw with an
          assignment of true to the same variable afterward.
