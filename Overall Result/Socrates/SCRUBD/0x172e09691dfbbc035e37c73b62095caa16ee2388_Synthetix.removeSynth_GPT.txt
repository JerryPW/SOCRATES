Function Security Analysis for Synthetix.removeSynth(bytes4)
    The modifier of function removeSynth are ['optionalProxy_onlyOwner']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier optionalProxy_onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The judgment is based on structure 1. The code includes `require(messageSender == owner, "This action can only be performed by the owner");`, which
          explicitly enforces that only the owner can execute the function. The requirement is based on matching 'messageSender' to 'owner'. There is no information in
          the code about a lock operation, so structure 2 does not apply. There is no omission as the critical requirement check is clearly present.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
