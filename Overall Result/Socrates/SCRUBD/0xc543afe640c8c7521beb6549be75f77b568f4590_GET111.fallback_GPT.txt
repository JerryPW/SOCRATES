Start analyze function: GET111.fallback()
Function Security Analysis for GET111.fallback()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
    Check direct function security
        - function GET111.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures that check if msg.sender is or is not a specified owner or leader. It only checks gas and
          value constraints and processes deposits.
        - function GET111.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code doesn't include a require statement that checks a boolean variable condition followed by a reassignment of that boolean variable.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['ADMIN.send(admin)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - ADMIN.send(admin) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains '.send(' keyword, which
        satisfies characteristic 2.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: GET111.pay()
Function Security Analysis for GET111.pay()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function pay.
    Check direct function security
        - function GET111.pay() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the required structures (require, if, or assert statements checking msg.sender).
        - function GET111.pay() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not contain any of the required conditional structures or statements as specified in the characteristics for the output to be 'Yes'.
          There are no 'require' statements or 'if' structures with 'throw' that modify the variable according to required patterns.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['fallback']
        Function Security Analysis for GET111.fallback()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
            Check direct function security
                - function GET111.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The given code does not involve any owner or leader checks based on the structures described. There are no conditions involving msg.sender
                  checking against an owner, address, leader, or CEO. It mainly handles transaction value and gas requirement checks. Thus it does not match any of the
                  specified patterns.
                - function GET111.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures involving require statements related to a boolean variable or if statements checking a
                  boolean variable and updating it.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['dep.depositor.send(money)', 'dep.depositor.send(dep.expect)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - dep.depositor.send(money) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the '.send('
        keyword, indicating it meets one of the characteristics.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - dep.depositor.send(dep.expect) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the
        '.send(' keyword, indicating it meets one of the characteristics.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
