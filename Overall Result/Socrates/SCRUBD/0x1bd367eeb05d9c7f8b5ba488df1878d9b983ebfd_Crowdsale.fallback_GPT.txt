Function Security Analysis for Crowdsale.fallback()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
    Check direct function security
        - function Crowdsale.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not include any checks or assertions related to msg.sender being equal to any owner, address, or leader role. Instead, it focuses on
          financial transactions related to a crowdsale.
        - function Crowdsale.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon reviewing the code again, the statement 'require(!crowdsaleClosed);' is present, but there are no subsequent statements setting 'crowdsaleClosed'
          to 'True', which means the identified pattern is incomplete. Thus, it does not satisfy the criteria listed.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['beneficiary.send(amount)', 'tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,sendTokens)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - beneficiary.send(amount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the '.send('
        keyword, which satisfies the specified characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,sendTokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,sendTokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,sendTokens)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['tokenReward'] should be checked in variable tokenReward
        Checked variables: tokenReward
            Yes The function code provided is a constructor since its name matches the contract name 'Crowdsale'. Constructors are special functions that are executed
            once when the contract is deployed and are typically named after the contract name prior to Solidity version 0.4.22 or explicitly named 'constructor'
            thereafter. Additionally, the constructor explicitly assigns the 'tokenReward' state variable to a hardcoded address
            '0x12AC8d8F0F48b7954bcdA736AF0576a12Dc8C387', fulfilling the requirement of having a hardcoded state variable.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
