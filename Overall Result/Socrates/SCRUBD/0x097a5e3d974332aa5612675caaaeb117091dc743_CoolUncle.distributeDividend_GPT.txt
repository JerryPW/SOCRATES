Function Security Analysis for CoolUncle.distributeDividend(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function distributeDividend.
    Check direct function security
        - function CoolUncle.distributeDividend(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain a check for msg.sender against any owner or leader address.
        - function CoolUncle.distributeDividend(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not contain any structure that matches the specified patterns (1-4). It includes an if statement checking if
          shares[shareholder].amount == 0 and returns if that condition is true, but this does not satisfy any of the required structures.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['setShare', 'process', 'gibSHIL']
        Function Security Analysis for CoolUncle.setShare(address,uint256)
            The modifier of function setShare are ['onlyToken']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyToken is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: Upon reevaluating the given code, the modifier 'onlyToken' contains a require statement that checks if 'msg.sender' equals '_token'. This
                  matches rule 1, which checks if the code enforces that only a specific address can execute the function. There are no lock operations involved, so rule
                  2 is not applicable here.
        Function Security Analysis for CoolUncle.process(uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function process.
            Check direct function security
                - function CoolUncle.process(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The provided code does not contain any msg.sender checks for ownership or specific roles like Owner, Address, Leader, or CEO.
                - function CoolUncle.process(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the given structures. It does not have statements like require or if with throwing an exception, followed by
                  changing a variable's state as specified in the structures.

    Analyze Transfer
        - IERC20(SHIL).transfer(shareholder,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - IERC20(SHIL).transfer(shareholder,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['IERC20(SHIL).transfer(shareholder,amount)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['SHIL'] should be checked in variable SHIL
        Checked variables: SHIL
            Yes 1. The function is explicitly named 'constructor', indicating it is a constructor function, which matches the first characteristic. 2. The state variable
            'SHIL' is hardcoded with the value '0x20c3fa331A385b63EE39137e99d0cF2db142fCe1', which satisfies the second characteristic.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
