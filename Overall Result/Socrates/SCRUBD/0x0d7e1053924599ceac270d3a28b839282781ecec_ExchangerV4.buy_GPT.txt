Function Security Analysis for ExchangerV4.buy(uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function buy.
    Check direct function security
        - function ExchangerV4.buy(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not include any restrictions or checks related to specific 'xxxOwner', 'xxxAddress', 'Leader', or 'CEO'. The provided conditions around
          msg.sender do not involve identity verification such as ensuring msg.sender is a specific address or an owner.
        - function ExchangerV4.buy(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not have any of the specified structures with the specific requirements involving require statements with true/false checks followed by
          assignments to the same variable.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['formulaContract.calculatePurchaseReturn((tokenContract.totalSupply()-uncirculatedSupplyCount)-
    tokenContract.balanceOf(this),(address(this).balance+virtualReserveBalance)-msg.value,weight,msg.value)', 'tokenContract.balanceOf(this)',
    'creator.transfer(transferToSafeWallet)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - creator.transfer(transferToSafeWallet) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains
        '.transfer(' keyword, therefore it satisfies one of the characteristics.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - formulaContract.calculatePurchaseReturn((tokenContract.totalSupply()-uncirculatedSupplyCount)-
        tokenContract.balanceOf(this),(address(this).balance+virtualReserveBalance)-msg.value,weight,msg.value) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - tokenContract.balanceOf(this) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['formulaContract.calculatePurchaseReturn((tokenContract.totalSupply()-uncirculatedSupplyCount)-
    tokenContract.balanceOf(this),(address(this).balance+virtualReserveBalance)-msg.value,weight,msg.value)', 'tokenContract.balanceOf(this)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['formulaContract'] should be checked in variable formulaContract
        Checked variables: formulaContract
            Yes The function in the provided code is a constructor because the name of the function is 'constructor', which explicitly indicates that it is the
            constructor for the contract. Constructors get executed once during the deployment of a contract and are used for initializing state variables of the
            contract.
        There are ['tokenContract'] should be checked in variable tokenContract
        Checked variables: tokenContract
            Yes The provided code is a constructor because the function is named 'constructor', which matches one of the specified conditions for determining if a
            function is a constructor.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
