Function Security Analysis for DividendDistributor.distributeDividend(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function distributeDividend.
    Check direct function security
        - function DividendDistributor.distributeDividend(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures related to checking msg.sender against an owner or leader role.
        - function DividendDistributor.distributeDividend(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures involving the 'require' statement or conditional throw in combination with variable
          assignments following the pattern described (setting a boolean to true and then optionally to false or vice versa). Instead, it contains conditional checks and
          return statements without the required pattern.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['process', 'setShare', 'claimDividend']
        Function Security Analysis for DividendDistributor.process(uint256)
            The modifier of function process are ['onlyToken']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyToken is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: Rule 1: The structure 'require(msg.sender == token);' in the code enforces that only a specific address (token) can execute the function. This
                  matches the criteria for Rule 1, which involves checking if the code structure enforces specific addresses to execute the function.
        Function Security Analysis for DividendDistributor.setShare(address,uint256)
            The modifier of function setShare are ['onlyToken']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyToken is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The code uses 'require(msg.sender == token);' which means only the specific address 'token' can execute the function. This satisfies the first
                  characteristic because it restricts function execution to a specific address.
        Function Security Analysis for DividendDistributor.claimDividend(address)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function claimDividend.
            Check direct function security
                - function DividendDistributor.claimDividend(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any structure that checks or enforces that 'msg.sender' is equal or not equal to any
                  xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
                - function DividendDistributor.claimDividend(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not have any 'require' or 'if' statements checking a condition on a boolean variable and subsequently modifying that boolean
                  variable. None of the specified structures are present.

    Analyze External Address
        There are ['USDC'] should be checked in variable USDC
        Checked variables: USDC
            State variable USDC has initialized in public area after declaration.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
