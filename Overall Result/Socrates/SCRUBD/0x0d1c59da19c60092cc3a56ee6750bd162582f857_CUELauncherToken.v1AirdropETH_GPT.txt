    The modifier of function v1AirdropETH are ['onlyOwner']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The modifier enforces that only the owner can execute the function with the statement 'require(_owner == _msgSender(), ...)', which directly matches
          characteristic 1. There are no structural omissions since the condition is found and evaluated correctly. The lock operation (characteristic 2) does not apply
          here since the code does not set and reset a flag for reentrancy protection.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
