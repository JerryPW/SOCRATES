Function Security Analysis for ShortOrder.tokenFulfillmentDeposit(address[2],uint256,uint256[8],uint8,bytes32[2])
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function tokenFulfillmentDeposit.
    Check direct function security
        - function ShortOrder.tokenFulfillmentDeposit(address[2],uint256,uint256[8],uint8,bytes32[2]) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of
        msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not have a require or if statement checking for msg.sender to be equal to an owner or equivalent role. It only checks for equality
          with addresses derived from signature verification, which does not match the specified patterns.
        - function ShortOrder.tokenFulfillmentDeposit(address[2],uint256,uint256[8],uint8,bytes32[2]) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: In the given code, the require statement checks that `orderRecord[msg.sender][orderHash].tokenDeposit` is false. Later, the assignment
          `orderRecord[msg.sender][orderHash].tokenDeposit = true;` sets it to true. However, this assignment is not immediately after the require statement; main
          function logic such as transfers and balance updates occur in between. The requirement for immediate negation after state check is not met.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['Token(tokenUser[0]).transferFrom(msg.sender,this,amount)']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - Token(tokenUser[0]).transferFrom(msg.sender,this,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['Token(tokenUser[0]).transferFrom(msg.sender,this,amount)']
    Analyze External Address
        The variable 'tokenUser' in external call 'Token(tokenUser[0]).transferFrom(msg.sender,this,amount)' has no state variable assigned. Therefore we check whether it
        has been hardcoded in the function.
            No In examining the provided code, the variable `tokenUser` is passed into the function `tokenFulfillmentDeposit` as an argument, specifically as an array of
            addresses. Throughout the function, it is treated dynamically without any indication of being hardcoded. It is used in operations like computing hashes and
            transferring tokens, indicating that its value can vary based on the function's input.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
