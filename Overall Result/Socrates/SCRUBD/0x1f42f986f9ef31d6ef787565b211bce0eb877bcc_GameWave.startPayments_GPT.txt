          Reason: The code does not check the identity of `msg.sender`. It only has a `require` statement that checks `block.timestamp`. There is no condition involving
          `msg.sender` which would fit the required characteristics.

          'require(!xxx); xxx = True;', or (4) 'if (!xxx) throw; xxx = true;'. The require statement in the code checks 'block.timestamp >= paymentsTime + 30 days', which
          doesn't match any of the specified patterns.
