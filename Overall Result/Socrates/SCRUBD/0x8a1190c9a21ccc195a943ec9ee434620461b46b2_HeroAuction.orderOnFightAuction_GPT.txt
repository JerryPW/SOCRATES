Function Security Analysis for HeroAuction.orderOnFightAuction(uint256,uint256,uint256)
    The modifier of function orderOnFightAuction are ['whenNotPaused']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier whenNotPaused has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The provided modifier checks a condition related to a 'paused' state but does not directly enforce that only the owner or specific addresses can execute
          the function, nor does it utilize a lock mechanism to prevent reentrancy. Also, the name 'whenNotPaused' does not imply ownership or non-reentrancy by itself.
    Check direct function security
        - function HeroAuction.orderOnFightAuction(uint256,uint256,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any checks that involve verifying if `msg.sender` has a particular owner, address, leader, or CEO status. It only checks
          whether `msg.sender` owns a specific Yin ID and if they have enough balance. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria specified for outputting 'Yes'.
        - function HeroAuction.orderOnFightAuction(uint256,uint256,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not meet any of the specified structures. It checks conditions using `require` and performs operations based on boolean evaluations,
          but it does not toggle any boolean variable from true to false or false to true as described in the specified structures.

        Checked variables: fightAuction
            No The function `setFightAuctionAddress` is neither a constructor nor does it involve hardcoding the state variable `fightAuction`. The function takes a
            parameter and assigns it, validating it with a condition, to the state variable. Therefore, neither criterion is met.
            Function Security Analysis for HeroAuction.setFightAuctionAddress(address)
                The modifier of function setFightAuctionAddress are ['onlyLeader']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyLeader is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: Upon reviewing the code modifier, I noticed that the require statement is the key element. It checks if msg.sender equals leaderAddress,
                      ensuring that only a specific address can execute the function. This satisfies characteristic 1, which makes the judgment correct. No other
                      structural elements are necessary for this characteristic, and there's no indication of a lock/unlock pattern that would satisfy characteristic 2.
                      Hence, the initial judgment remains valid.
        There are ['fightAuction'] should be checked in variable fightAuction
        Checked variables: fightAuction
            No The function provided is named `setFightAuctionAddress`. This name neither matches the contract name `HeroAuction` nor is it named as 'constructor', so it
            is not a constructor function or special function defined as constructor.  Furthermore, the function does not hardcode any value to the `fightAuction` state
            variable. Instead, it takes an address as a parameter, verifies it, and assigns it to the `fightAuction` state variable. No hardcoded value is involved in the
            assignment to `fightAuction`.
            Function Security Analysis for HeroAuction.setFightAuctionAddress(address)
                The modifier of function setFightAuctionAddress are ['onlyLeader']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyLeader is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The code in the modifier uses 'require(msg.sender == leaderAddress);', which enforces that only the specific address identified by
                      'leaderAddress' can execute the function. This matches the first characteristic described.
        There are ['fightAuction'] should be checked in variable fightAuction
        Checked variables: fightAuction
            No The function 'setFightAuctionAddress' is not a constructor since its name does not match the contract name 'HeroAuction' and it is not explicitly declared
            as 'constructor'. Also, it does not hardcode the 'fightAuction' state variable, as it sets the state variable using the input parameter '_address' rather than
            a constant or hardcoded value.
            Function Security Analysis for HeroAuction.setFightAuctionAddress(address)
                The modifier of function setFightAuctionAddress are ['onlyLeader']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyLeader is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The code contains 'require(msg.sender == leaderAddress);' which verifies that only the specified address ('leaderAddress') can execute the
                      function. This confirms that the code enforces an owner-specific execution, corresponding to rule 1.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Function Security Analysis for HeroFighting._fight(uint32,uint32)
    The modifier of function _fight are ['whenNotPaused']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier whenNotPaused has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier 'whenNotPaused' does not enforce that only the owner or specific addresses can execute the function, nor does it utilize a lock operation.
          It only checks if a contract is paused. None of the specified characteristics are met.
    Check direct function security
        - function HeroFighting._fight(uint32,uint32) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any explicit checks for msg.sender equality or inequality with xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO. It primarily performs
          operations related to updating the state of heroes during a fight.
        - function HeroFighting._fight(uint32,uint32) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code contains an if condition that checks if a certain variable `flag` is not true (i.e., `if(!flag)`) and then performs a swap operation `(_yinId,
          _yangId) = (_yangId, _yinId);`. However, this does not include explicitly setting the variable `flag` to true, nor does it include any matching statements that
          satisfy the required conditions precisely as they were described.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

                - function HeroAuction.orderOnFightAuction(uint256,uint256,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures that directly check if msg.sender equals a specific owner, address, leader, or CEO. It
                  checks ownership through a function and does not directly compare msg.sender to a specific privileged role within the function's conditional logic.
                - function HeroAuction.orderOnFightAuction(uint256,uint256,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The function does not require a certain boolean variable to be either True or False at the start and then change it within the function. It
                  checks various conditions but does not meet any of the requested structures.

            No The provided code is not a constructor because the function name ('setMasterRecruitmentAddress') does not match the contract name ('HeroAuction') and it is
            not explicitly named 'constructor'. Additionally, the code does not hardcode the state variable 'masterRecruitment'; instead, it assigns a new value based on
            the provided address parameter and a call to a function of the candidate contract.
            Function Security Analysis for HeroFighting.setMasterRecruitmentAddress(address)
                The modifier of function setMasterRecruitmentAddress are ['onlyLeader']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyLeader is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The code enforces that only the leader can execute the function by using 'require(msg.sender == leaderAddress);', which matches the first
                      characteristic. There are no structural omissions related to characteristic one. There is no lock/unlock mechanism present in the code, so it does
                      not match characteristic two. Therefore, based on the enforcement of execution permission using the leader address, the output is 'Yes.'
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
