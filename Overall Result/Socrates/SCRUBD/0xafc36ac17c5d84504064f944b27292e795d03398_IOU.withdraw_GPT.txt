          in the listed patterns (1-4). There is no use of 'require', 'assert', or 'if' statements that check `msg.sender` against such roles.

          'if(eth_to_refund == 0 || iou_purchased[msg.sender] == 0) throw;', there isn't a corresponding statement setting the same variables to true (or in a similar
          enabling state) afterward. Thus, none of the required structures are fully present in the code.
