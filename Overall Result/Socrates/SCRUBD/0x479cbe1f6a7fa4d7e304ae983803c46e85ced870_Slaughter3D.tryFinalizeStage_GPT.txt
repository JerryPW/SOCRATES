    There are no modifiers should be examined in function tryFinalizeStage.
    Check direct function security
        - function Slaughter3D.tryFinalizeStage() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not have any conditions or assertions with msg.sender involving an owner, leader, CEO or similar. The msg.sender is not used in
          conditions like the require, if, or assert statements as specified.
        - function Slaughter3D.tryFinalizeStage() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The variable 'stageToFinalize.finalized' is checked with 'assert(!stageToFinalize.finalized)', but the negation through 'stageToFinalize.finalized =
          true;' does not happen immediately afterward. Instead, it occurs after the main logic of the function, which consists of multiple conditional checks and
          operations. Thus, the code does not satisfy the requirements.
