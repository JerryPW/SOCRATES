Function Security Analysis for SafeDif.distributeRef(uint256,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function distributeRef.
    Check direct function security
        - function SafeDif.distributeRef(uint256,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: None of the specified structural checks for 'require', 'if', or 'assert' statements with 'msg.sender' exist in the given code.
        - function SafeDif.distributeRef(uint256,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any statements with 'require' or 'if(!xxx) throw;' and does not manipulate any variable immediately after such checks
          in the way described in the prompt. Thus, it doesn't match any of the given structures.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['fallback', 'invest']
        Function Security Analysis for SafeDif.fallback()
            The modifier of function fallback are ['isActivated']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier isActivated has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier 'isActivated' does not enforce ownership or lock operations directly, nor does its name suggest such constraints. It only checks if
                  a contract or feature is activated.
            Check direct function security
                - function SafeDif.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: None of the specified structures or conditions (checking msg.sender against xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO) is present in the code.
                - function SafeDif.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The given function does not contain any of the specified structures with require statements or conditional checks involving a variable being
                  assigned and reassigned, as outlined in the characteristics.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['player_[_affID2].addr.transfer(_aff)', 'player_[_affID1].addr.transfer(_aff)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - player_[_affID2].addr.transfer(_aff) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the
        keyword '.transfer('.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - player_[_affID1].addr.transfer(_aff) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the
        keyword '.transfer('.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
