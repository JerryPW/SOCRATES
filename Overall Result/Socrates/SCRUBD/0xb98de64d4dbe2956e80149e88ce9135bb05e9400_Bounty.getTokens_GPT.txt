        - function Bounty.getTokens(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not have any condition checking msg.sender against an 'Owner', 'Address', 'Leader', or 'CEO'. It checks conditions on 'beneficiary'
          and other logical assertions to validate the function execution.

          outside of 'require()'.

            Yes 1. The function is named "Bounty," which matches the contract name. This indicates that the function is likely a constructor for the contract.
            Constructors in Solidity are special functions that are executed during the deployment of a contract, used for initial setup, such as initializing state
            variables.  2. The function does not hardcode the state variable "token". The variable "token" is being assigned a value passed as an argument "_tokenAddress"
            and the assignment depends on the input, hence it is not hardcoded.  Since the function is identified as a constructor, it satisfies the first characteristic.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
