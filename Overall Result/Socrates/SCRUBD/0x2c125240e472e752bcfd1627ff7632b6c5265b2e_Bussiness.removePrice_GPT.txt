    There are no modifiers should be examined in function removePrice.
    Check direct function security
        - function Bussiness.removePrice(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code uses require(erc721Address.ownerOf(tokenId) == msg.sender), but this usage is guided by a function call (erc721Address.ownerOf(tokenId)), which
          retrieves owner information locally and does not match any predefined structures with fixed owner/CEO variables. Thus, it doesn't count towards the specified
          structures because it's not a direct fixed reference to an owner address or similar role as required by the criteria.
        - function Bussiness.removePrice(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code block does not contain any of the specified patterns. It involves a single require statement checking ownership without altering the variable
          immediate after.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['erc721Address.ownerOf(tokenId)', 'msg.sender.transfer(prices[tokenId].fee)', 'hbwalletToken.transfer(msg.sender,prices[tokenId].hbfee)']

        - msg.sender.transfer(prices[tokenId].fee) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call
        'msg.sender.transfer(prices[tokenId].fee)' contains the '.transfer(' keyword, which satisfies rule 1.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - hbwalletToken.transfer(msg.sender,prices[tokenId].hbfee) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - erc721Address.ownerOf(tokenId) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - hbwalletToken.transfer(msg.sender,prices[tokenId].hbfee) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['erc721Address.ownerOf(tokenId)', 'hbwalletToken.transfer(msg.sender,prices[tokenId].hbfee)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['erc721Address'] should be checked in variable erc721Address
        Checked variables: erc721Address
            State variable erc721Address has initialized in public area after declaration.
        There are ['hbwalletToken'] should be checked in variable hbwalletToken
        Checked variables: hbwalletToken
            State variable hbwalletToken has initialized in public area after declaration.
