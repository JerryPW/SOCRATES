Function Security Analysis for Crowdsale.updatePrice()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function updatePrice.
    Check direct function security
        - function Crowdsale.updatePrice() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not involve any checking of msg.sender against any defined roles or addresses like xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO in a require, if, or
          assert statement.
        - function Crowdsale.updatePrice() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures with a require statement or an if(!xxx) throw statement followed by changing the
          value of `xxx`. The conditional checks and variable assignments around `pendingQueries[queryId] = true;` do not correspond to the required patterns.

Function Security Analysis for usingOraclize.oraclize_getPrice(string)
    The modifier of function oraclize_getPrice are ['oraclizeAPI']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier oraclizeAPI has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier 'oraclizeAPI' does not contain code enforcing execution only by an owner or specific addresses, nor does it use lock operations or have a
          function name that implies access restriction or reentrancy prevention.
    Check direct function security
        - function usingOraclize.oraclize_getPrice(string) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any checks or constraints related to 'msg.sender'. It only calls a function from an external API without performing any sender
          verification. Therefore, there is no structure where 'msg.sender' is compared against specific roles like xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, CEO.
        - function usingOraclize.oraclize_getPrice(string) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code is a function definition to get a price from the Oraclize API and does not contain any of the specified structures which involve
          'require' or conditional logic with variable assignments.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['__callback', '__callback', 'updatePrice']

            There are no modifiers should be examined in function __callback.
            Check direct function security
                - function usingOraclize.__callback(bytes32,string) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures checking msg.sender against an xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO.
                - function usingOraclize.__callback(bytes32,string) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided function does not contain any of the structural patterns described in the question. There is no usage of the 'require' function or
                  conditional 'throw' handling that meets the specified criteria.

Function Security Analysis for usingOraclize.oraclize_query(uint256,string,string)
    The modifier of function oraclize_query are ['oraclizeAPI']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier oraclizeAPI has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier oraclizeAPI does not contain any checks for specific addresses or ownership, nor does it use a lock mechanism or have a name suggesting
          restricted access or non-reentrancy. It only contains logic related to setting network parameters and interacting with an oracle interface.
    Check direct function security
        - function usingOraclize.oraclize_query(uint256,string,string) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not include any checks related to msg.sender or any related constructs, such as checking against ownership-related variables or
          requiring a certain sender identity. It primarily focuses on price validation for the oracle query.
        - function usingOraclize.oraclize_query(uint256,string,string) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not match any of the specified structures where a variable's state is explicitly checked with a 'require' statement or
          conditionally throws an error based on that variable's state, followed by a change in the state of the same variable as per the rules outlined in the
          characteristics.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['__callback', '__callback', 'updatePrice']

            There are no modifiers should be examined in function __callback.
            Check direct function security
                - function usingOraclize.__callback(bytes32,string) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any statements that check msg.sender against any xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO values using require, if, or
                  assert statements.
                - function usingOraclize.__callback(bytes32,string) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code does not include any 'require' statements or 'if' conditions with 'throw'. There are no variable assignments to check against
                  the specified structures, thus none of the listed patterns are satisfied.
