Function Security Analysis for SellERC20BasicTokens.fallback()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
    Check direct function security
        - function SellERC20BasicTokens.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code doesn't use any of the specified structures to check for a specific address or role using msg.sender.
        - function SellERC20BasicTokens.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code doesn't have any of the four specific structures described. It performs token sale logic with checks and balances but lacks
          conditional or transfer logic involving the setting of a boolean variable as required.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['msg.sender.transfer(weiAmount-weiExpense.mul(10**decimalDiff))', 'token.balanceOf(address(this))', 'token.transfer(msg.sender,tokenBought)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - msg.sender.transfer(weiAmount-weiExpense.mul(10**decimalDiff)) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The
        call 'msg.sender.transfer(weiAmount-weiExpense.mul(10**decimalDiff))' contains the '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - token.transfer(msg.sender,tokenBought) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - token.balanceOf(address(this)) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - token.transfer(msg.sender,tokenBought) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['token.balanceOf(address(this))', 'token.transfer(msg.sender,tokenBought)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            Yes The code snippet provided is a constructor for the contract named SellERC20BasicTokens. This is evident because the function is explicitly named
            'constructor', satisfying the first characteristic. Additionally, the state variable 'token' is hardcoded in this constructor, as seen in the line 'token =
            _token;'. Thus, the function satisfies at least one of the characteristics outlined.
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            Yes The provided function in the code is named 'constructor', which matches the criterion of being a constructor by explicit naming.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
