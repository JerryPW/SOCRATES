Function Security Analysis for Crowdsale.fallback()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
    Check direct function security
        - function Crowdsale.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any condition involving msg.sender in comparison or assertion with xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO.
        - function Crowdsale.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon re-evaluation, the code contains 'require(!crowdsaleClosed);' but does not include the subsequent 'crowdsaleClosed = True;' statement, or any
          direct statement equivalent within the required conditions of the specified structures. The presence of both statements is mandatory in order to meet any of the
          specified structures, especially structure 3. Therefore, the previous judgment was incorrect.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['beneficiary.send(amount)', 'tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,sendTokens)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - beneficiary.send(amount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call contains the '.send(' keyword..
        Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,sendTokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,sendTokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,sendTokens)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['tokenReward'] should be checked in variable tokenReward
        Checked variables: tokenReward
            Yes The function in the provided code is named 'Crowdsale', which matches the name of the contract. Hence, it is a constructor function. Therefore, it
            satisfies the first characteristic of being a constructor function.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
