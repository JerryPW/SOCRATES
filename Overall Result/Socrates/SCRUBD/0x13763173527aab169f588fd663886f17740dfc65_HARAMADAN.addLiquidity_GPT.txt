        - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.

          requiring 'msg.sender == _owner'. This matches the first characteristic, ensuring the function is restricted to the owner. There is no lock operation in the
          code, so the second characteristic does not apply. Therefore, only the first condition is applicable here, and the judgment is not based on a single matching
          statement but on the correct interpretation of the provided code.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
