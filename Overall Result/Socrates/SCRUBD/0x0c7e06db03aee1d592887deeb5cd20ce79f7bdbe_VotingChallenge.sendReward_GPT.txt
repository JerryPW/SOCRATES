Function Security Analysis for VotingChallenge.sendReward(address)
    The modifier of function sendReward are ['afterVotingPeriod']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier afterVotingPeriod has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier checks for the condition 'require(!isVotingPeriod);', which does not satisfy any of the specified characteristics. There's no check for
          ownership, specific addresses, or a lock operation in the given code.
    Check direct function security
        - function VotingChallenge.sendReward(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not include any checks involving 'msg.sender == xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO' or similar conditions, nor does it restrict access with
          '!='
        - function VotingChallenge.sendReward(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures, such as 'require' statements that modify a variable, nor does it contain an 'if'
          statement that throws an error and subsequently modifies the same variable as described.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['forwarder.forward.value(sum)(referrer2,to)', 'forwarder.forward.value(sum)(referrer1,to)', 'to.transfer(reward+voters[to].fullVotes[winner])']
    Analyze Transfer
        - to.transfer(reward+voters[to].fullVotes[winner]) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        contains '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - forwarder.forward.value(sum)(referrer2,to) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - forwarder.forward.value(sum)(referrer1,to) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['forwarder.forward.value(sum)(referrer2,to)', 'forwarder.forward.value(sum)(referrer1,to)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['forwarder'] should be checked in variable forwarder
        Checked variables: forwarder
            Yes The provided code contains a constructor function because the function name matches the contract name, 'VotingChallenge'. Therefore, it satisfies the
            first characteristic.
        There are ['forwarder'] should be checked in variable forwarder
        Checked variables: forwarder
            Yes The provided code is a constructor because its name is 'constructor', which is explicitly indicated in the code. Additionally, it involves setting the
            state variable 'forwarder' using the parameter '_forwarder', but it is not hardcoded.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
