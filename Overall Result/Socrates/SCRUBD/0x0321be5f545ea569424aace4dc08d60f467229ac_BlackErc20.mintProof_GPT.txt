Function Security Analysis for BlackErc20.mintProof(uint256,address,bytes32[])
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function mintProof.
    Check direct function security
        - function BlackErc20.mintProof(uint256,address,bytes32[]) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not check if 'msg.sender' matches any xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO condition.
        - function BlackErc20.mintProof(uint256,address,bytes32[]) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the required structures where a variable is set to false and later checked or set to true according to the
          described formats. Specifically, there's no usage of 'require(xxx == True)' followed by setting 'xxx = False' or vice versa. Also, there are no 'if(!xxx) throw'
          conditions followed by 'xxx = true'. Hence, none of the conditions match.

    Analyze External Address
        There are ['wethAddress'] should be checked in variable wethAddress
        Checked variables: wethAddress
            State variable wethAddress has initialized in public area after declaration.
        There are ['lpContract'] should be checked in variable lpContract
        Checked variables: lpContract
            No The provided code is for the function 'setLPContract', which does not match the contract name 'BlackErc20', thus it is not a constructor. The function
            updates the state variable 'lpContract' with a parameter 'lp', but it is not hardcoded as it relies on external input rather than a fixed value.
            Function Security Analysis for BlackErc20.setLPContract(address)
                The modifier of function setLPContract are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The modifier name 'onlyOwner' suggests it enforces that only the owner can execute the function, fitting rule 3. There is no indication of a
                      lock/unlock operation, fitting rule 2.
        There are ['wethAddress'] should be checked in variable wethAddress
        Checked variables: wethAddress
            State variable wethAddress has initialized in public area after declaration.
        There are ['wethAddress'] should be checked in variable wethAddress
        Checked variables: wethAddress
            State variable wethAddress has initialized in public area after declaration.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
