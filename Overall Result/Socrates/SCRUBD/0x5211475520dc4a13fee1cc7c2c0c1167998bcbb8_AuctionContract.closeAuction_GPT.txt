Function Security Analysis for AuctionContract.closeAuction()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function closeAuction.
    Check direct function security
        - function AuctionContract.closeAuction() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The assertion in the code checks if msg.sender is equal to winner, which does not match the pattern where xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO should be
          directly compared with msg.sender. The role 'winner' might be a dynamic entity and doesn't fall under the static roles specified in the criteria.
        - function AuctionContract.closeAuction() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon re-evaluation, the code does not satisfy the required structures. The presence of 'assert(isActive)' is similar to 'require(isActive == True)', but
          the second condition 'isActive = false;' alone does not complete the pattern required by the described structures. There is no setting of 'isActive = True' or
          equivalent statement that conforms to the required pattern. The function only contains a check using 'assert' without a preceding 'require' and does not follow
          with a change of 'isActive' from True to False; hence, it doesn't fulfill the full structural requirement.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['auctioneer.createAuctionContract.value(firstValue)()', 'auctioneer.createAuctionContract.value(secondValue)()', 'msg.sender.transfer(prize)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - msg.sender.transfer(prize) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call contains '.transfer(' keyword,
        hence it satisfies the characteristic 1.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - auctioneer.createAuctionContract.value(firstValue)() ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - auctioneer.createAuctionContract.value(secondValue)() ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['auctioneer.createAuctionContract.value(firstValue)()', 'auctioneer.createAuctionContract.value(secondValue)()']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['auctioneerAddress'] should be checked in variable auctioneer
        Checked variables: auctioneerAddress
            Yes The provided code is a constructor because the function is explicitly named 'constructor'. Constructors are special functions in Solidity used for setting
            up initial state variables and are executed once when the contract is deployed.
        There are ['auctioneerAddress'] should be checked in variable auctioneer
        Checked variables: auctioneerAddress
            Yes The provided code snippet is a constructor for the contract, which is indicated by the function name being 'constructor'. The constructor function also
            initializes the state variable 'auctioneerAddress' with the provided argument '_auctioneerAddress'. This satisfies the first condition of checking if the code
            is a constructor.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
