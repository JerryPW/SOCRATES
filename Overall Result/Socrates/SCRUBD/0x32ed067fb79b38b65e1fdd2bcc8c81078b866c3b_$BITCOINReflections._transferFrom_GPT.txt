Function Security Analysis for $BITCOINReflections._transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _transferFrom.
    Check direct function security
        - function $BITCOINReflections._transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code provided implements a `_transferFrom` function which handles transactions between sender and recipient. It doesn't have authorization checks
          related to 'msg.sender' such as those specified in the task (conditions involving 1 msg.sender == xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO).
        - function $BITCOINReflections._transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not contain any explicit 'require(xxx == True)' or 'require(xxx == False)' statements. There are multiple 'require' statements, but
          they check different conditions than the ones specified in the provided criteria. None of the structures match the provided conditions.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transfer', 'transferFrom']
        Function Security Analysis for $BITCOINReflections.transfer(address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transfer.
            Check direct function security
                - function $BITCOINReflections.transfer(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain any checks or assertions related to checking if msg.sender is equal to or not equal to a specific owner or address
                  mentioned (such as xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO).
                - function $BITCOINReflections.transfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not have any require or if conditions that check a boolean variable 'xxx' followed by an assignment to 'xxx' as specified in the
                  characteristics. It consists of a single return statement which calls another function, hence does not match any of the given structures.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['distributor.setShare(recipient,_balances[recipient])', 'distributor.process(distributorGas)',
    'distributor.setShare(sender,_balances[sender])']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - distributor.setShare(recipient,_balances[recipient]) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - distributor.process(distributorGas) is subjected to gas limits distributorGas <= 3000. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The
        function `setDistributorSettings` assigns a value to the variable `distributorGas` after checking that the input `gas` is less than 750,000. There is no other
        direct assignment or modification to `distributorGas` in the code other than through this function. Given that the value is required to be less than 750,000, it
        will always be less than or equal to 3,000. Therefore, the assignment to the variable `distributorGas` will always be less than or equal to 3,000.  The
        `distributorGas` is initially set to 500,000, which is also less than 3,000. Since no operation in the provided code increases this value beyond 750,000, the
        condition always holds true with the provided constraints.
        - distributor.setShare(sender,_balances[sender]) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['distributor.setShare(recipient,_balances[recipient])', 'distributor.setShare(sender,_balances[sender])']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['distributor'] should be checked in variable distributor
        Checked variables: distributor
            Yes 1. The code includes a constructor function (named 'constructor'), which matches one of the characteristics defined for determining a 'Yes' outcome. 2.
            The state variable 'distributor' is assigned without using an external call or variable, but is instantiated through 'new DividendDistributor(_dexRouter);'.
            However, this is not considered hardcoding of a state variable in this context.  Thus, the determination is based on the presence of a constructor.
        There are ['distributor'] should be checked in variable distributor
        Checked variables: distributor
            Yes The code provided is a constructor function because it is explicitly named 'constructor'. This satisfies the first characteristic of the provided rule,
            which checks whether the provided code is a constructor.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: $BITCOINReflections.swapBack()
Function Security Analysis for $BITCOINReflections.swapBack()
    The modifier of function swapBack are ['swapping']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier swapping is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The modifier includes both a lock operation (`inSwap = true;`) and an unlock operation (`inSwap = false;`) around the function call (`_;`). This
          satisfies rule 2 of using a lock operation to ensure the function enters only once.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Function Security Analysis for $BITCOINReflections.triggerAutoBuyback()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function triggerAutoBuyback.
    Check direct function security
        - function $BITCOINReflections.triggerAutoBuyback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any checks or assertions on 'msg.sender' against a variable such as xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO. It only includes specific
          operations related to triggering an auto-buyback and updating some variables.
        - function $BITCOINReflections.triggerAutoBuyback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not have any 'require(xxx == True)', 'require(xxx == False)', 'require(!xxx)', or 'if(!xxx) throw' statements, which are needed to satisfy
          any of the outlined structures. The conditions specified do not match any of the given formats precisely.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transfer', '_transferFrom', 'transferFrom']

Start analyze function: $BITCOINReflections.buyTokens(uint256,address)
Function Security Analysis for $BITCOINReflections.buyTokens(uint256,address)
    The modifier of function buyTokens are ['swapping']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier swapping is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The modifier contains both the lock and unlock operation: it sets 'inSwap' to true before running the function and resets 'inSwap' to false afterward,
          ensuring the function enters only once.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
