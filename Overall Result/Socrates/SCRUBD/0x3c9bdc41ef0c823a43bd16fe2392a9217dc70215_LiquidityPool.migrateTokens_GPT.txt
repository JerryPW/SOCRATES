Function Security Analysis for LiquidityPool.migrateTokens()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function migrateTokens.
    Check direct function security
        - function LiquidityPool.migrateTokens() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The `migrateTokens` function does not include checks specifically for `msg.sender` being equal to or not equal to 'xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO', such
          as `require(msg.sender == xxxOwner)`. The function uses other conditions like checking if migration is enabled and if the previous balance is greater than 0,
          but these do not fit the specified structure for checking authorization according to the characteristics provided.
        - function LiquidityPool.migrateTokens() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The structural pattern (structure 3) is present as initially mentioned, with 'require(!thisStaker.hasMigrated, ...);' checking the state and
          'thisStaker.hasMigrated = true;' setting the state. However, the negation (setting 'hasMigrated' to true) is performed after executing significant parts of the
          core logic, like transferring tokens, deleting balances, etc. Thus, the negation does not occur immediately after the check statement before proceeding with
          main logic.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['uniswapPair.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),previousBalance)']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - uniswapPair.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),previousBalance) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['uniswapPair.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),previousBalance)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['uniswapPair'] should be checked in variable uniswapPair
        Checked variables: uniswapPair
            Yes The given code contains a constructor function indicated by the 'constructor' keyword. This constructor initializes the state variable 'uniswapPair' and
            other variables with hardcoded addresses, thus satisfying both characteristics for an external call.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
