Function Security Analysis for IceMachine._transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _transferFrom.
    Check direct function security
        - function IceMachine._transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any checks or assertions regarding msg.sender being equal to or not equal to an owner, address, leader, or CEO.
        - function IceMachine._transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not include any of the specified structures: no require statements checking for a boolean and flipping it. There are require
          statements, but they do not fulfill the complex condition patterns specified in the task.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transfer', 'transferFrom']
        Function Security Analysis for IceMachine.transfer(address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transfer.
            Check direct function security
                - function IceMachine.transfer(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code snippet does not include any checks related to `msg.sender` against specific roles such as xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO using
                  require, if, or assert statements.
                - function IceMachine.transfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: None of the specified code structures are present in the given function. There are no 'require' or 'if' statements that check the condition of a
                  variable and then change its boolean value.

    Analyze Gas
        - distributor.setShare(recipient,_balances[recipient]) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - distributor.process(distributorGas) is subjected to gas limits distributorGas <= 3000. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The
        variable distributorGas is assigned within the setDistributorSettings function. This function has a require statement that ensures the parameter gas (which is
        assigned to distributorGas) must be less than 750,000. Since 750,000 is greater than 3,000, the gas value (and hence, distributorGas) will always satisfy the
        condition of being less than 750,000 by contract design. There is no code allowing distributorGas to be set outside of this function, which means the condition is
        enforced consistently. Therefore, distributorGas is always less than or equal to 3,000, making the answer True as per the context of the provided code.
        - distributor.setShare(sender,_balances[sender]) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['distributor.setShare(recipient,_balances[recipient])', 'distributor.setShare(sender,_balances[sender])']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['distributor'] should be checked in variable distributor
        Checked variables: distributor
            Yes The provided code is a constructor for the contract. This is evident because the function doesn't have a name but is labeled as 'constructor', which is
            typical for constructors in Solidity.
        There are ['distributor'] should be checked in variable distributor
        Checked variables: distributor
            Yes The provided function is a constructor because its name is 'constructor' and it matches the characteristic listed as the first criterion. As such, it
            satisfies the condition related to checking if the provided code is a constructor.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: IceMachine.swapBack()
Function Security Analysis for IceMachine.swapBack()
    The modifier of function swapBack are ['swapping']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier swapping is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The modifier 'swapping' includes both a lock operation, 'inSwap = true', and an unlock operation, 'inSwap = false', which conforms to the requirement of
          ensuring a function enters only once. Therefore, the judgment stands correct as it satisfies rule 2, which requires both operations to be present and matched in
          the structure.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: IceMachine.triggerAutoBuyback()
Function Security Analysis for IceMachine.triggerAutoBuyback()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function triggerAutoBuyback.
    Check direct function security
        - function IceMachine.triggerAutoBuyback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not include any checks on msg.sender for specific ownership or role verification.
        - function IceMachine.triggerAutoBuyback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code provided does not contain any 'require' statements or 'if' throw structure that match the given patterns involving setting a variable to true
          or false and optionally reversing it. The condition checks and state changes do not follow the required structures.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transfer', 'transferFrom', '_transferFrom']
        Function Security Analysis for IceMachine.transfer(address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transfer.
            Check direct function security
                - function IceMachine.transfer(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any check on msg.sender regarding ownership or role such as Owner, Leader, CEO, or equivalent conditions using
                  require, if, or assert structures. It simply returns the result of the _transferFrom function call.
                - function IceMachine.transfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code snippet does not contain any `require` statements or conditional `if` structures related to boolean variables that follow the given
                  structures.

Start analyze function: IceMachine.buyTokens(uint256,address)
Function Security Analysis for IceMachine.buyTokens(uint256,address)
    The modifier of function buyTokens are ['swapping']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier swapping is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The modifier 'swapping' sets the variable 'inSwap' to true before executing the function and resets it to false afterward, which matches both the lock
          and unlock operations needed for rule number 2.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
