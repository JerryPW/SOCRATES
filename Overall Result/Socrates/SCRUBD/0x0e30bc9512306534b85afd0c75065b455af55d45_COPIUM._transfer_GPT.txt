    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _transfer.
    Check direct function security
        - function COPIUM._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: There is a condition 'if (from != owner() && to != owner()...) {...}' but it does not match the required pattern to involve msg.sender.
        - function COPIUM._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code contains the statement: require(_isBlacklistWallet[from] == false), which corresponds to characteristic 2: require(xxx == False). However, the
          associated xxx = True statement is missing in the provided snippet, hence it does not fulfil the criteria.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transfer', 'transferFrom']
        Function Security Analysis for COPIUM.transfer(address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transfer.
            Check direct function security
                - function COPIUM.transfer(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The given code does not contain any checks or conditions using msg.sender related to xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO roles, such as require, if,
                  or assert statements.
                - function COPIUM.transfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided function does not contain any 'require' or 'if' statements for condition checks, nor does it involve setting a boolean variable.
                  Therefore, it does not match any of the specified structures.

Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: COPIUM.swapAndLiquify()
Function Security Analysis for COPIUM.swapAndLiquify()
    The modifier of function swapAndLiquify are ['lockTheSwap']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier lockTheSwap is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The modifier 'lockTheSwap' includes both the lock and unlock operations: it sets 'inSwapAndLiquify' to true before executing the function body (denoted
          by '_;') and resets it to false afterward. This fully satisfies condition 2, confirming the initial judgment was correct.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
