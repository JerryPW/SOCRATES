Function Security Analysis for SAFX._transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _transferFrom.
    Check direct function security
        - function SAFX._transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The condition 'require(tradingLive || sender == owner' does not match any of the specified structures as it does not involve 'msg.sender' directly and
          'owner' is a function parameter, not a fixed role like xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO.
        - function SAFX._transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function does not have any of the specified structures present, such as using either `require(xxx == True)` followed by `xxx = False` or similar
          patterns. It only uses regular require and balance checks without changing the boolean value as described.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transfer', 'transferFrom']
        Function Security Analysis for SAFX.transfer(address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transfer.
            Check direct function security
                - function SAFX.transfer(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any access control checks using msg.sender. It directly calls _transferFrom without verifying the sender against
                  any owner or specific address role.
                - function SAFX.transfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code provided does not have any of the specified structures involving 'require' or defensive code logic that toggles a boolean variable. It
                  is a straightforward function call without any preconditions or state changes on a boolean. Therefore, it does not match any of the outlined patterns.

Start analyze function: SAFX._sellTaxedTokens()
Function Security Analysis for SAFX._sellTaxedTokens()
    The modifier of function _sellTaxedTokens are ['swapping']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier swapping is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The modifier 'swapping' uses a lock operation by setting a flag '_swapping' to true before the function execution and resetting it to false afterward,
          ensuring the function enters only once.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
