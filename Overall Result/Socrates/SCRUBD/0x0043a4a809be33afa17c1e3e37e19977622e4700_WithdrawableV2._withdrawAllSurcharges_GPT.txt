    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _withdrawAllSurcharges.
    Check direct function security
        - function WithdrawableV2._withdrawAllSurcharges() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any checks or assertions related to msg.sender being an owner, address, or leader; it only manages internal logic related to
          balances and fees, without any access control logic.
        - function WithdrawableV2._withdrawAllSurcharges() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not include any require or if statement that mandates a condition followed by an assignment altering the state of the same
          variable. Thus, no structure matches the specified patterns.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['withdrawRamppSurcharges', 'withdrawERC20']
        Function Security Analysis for WithdrawableV2.withdrawRamppSurcharges()
            The modifier of function withdrawRamppSurcharges are ['isRampp']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier isRampp is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The modifier isRampp contains the statement 'require(msg.sender == RAMPPADDRESS, "Ownable: caller is not RAMPP");', which enforces that only the
                  specified address, RAMPPADDRESS, can execute the function. This satisfies the first characteristic. There is no indication of a lock mechanism since
                  there's no mention of setting a flag to true and then resetting it to false, which would satisfy the second characteristic.
        Function Security Analysis for WithdrawableV2.withdrawERC20(address,uint256)
            The modifier of function withdrawERC20 are ['onlyTeamOrOwner']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyTeamOrOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The modifier `onlyTeamOrOwner` uses a require statement to enforce that the caller is either the owner or a part of the team. Specifically, the
                  line `require(_isOwner || _isTeam, "Team: caller is not the owner or in Team.")` checks if `_isOwner` (where `owner() == _msgSender()`) or `_isTeam`
                  (where `inTeam(_msgSender())`) is true. This corresponds to rule 1, where the execution is restricted to specific addresses (owner or team members). No
                  lock operation is present, so rule 2 does not apply.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
