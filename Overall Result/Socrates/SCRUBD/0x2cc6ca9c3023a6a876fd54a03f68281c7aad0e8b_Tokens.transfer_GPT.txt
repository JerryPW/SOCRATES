Function Security Analysis for Tokens.transfer(address,uint256)
    The modifier of function transfer are ['notTimeLocked', 'stopInEmergency']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier notTimeLocked is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The code includes the check of specific addresses, i.e., 'msg.sender != addressSCICO && msg.sender != addressSCEscrow' in the 'if' condition, which
          ensures that only specific addresses can bypass the timelock. This enforcement corresponds to characteristic 1, as it controls the execution ability based on
          the sender's address. It does not show a locking mechanism or set/reset a flag, thus not matching characteristic 2. This review of the full code confirms the
          initial judgment based on characteristic 1, without any structural omissions.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
