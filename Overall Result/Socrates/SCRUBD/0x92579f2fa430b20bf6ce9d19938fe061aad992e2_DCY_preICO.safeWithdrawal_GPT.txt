Function Security Analysis for DCY_preICO.safeWithdrawal()
    The modifier of function safeWithdrawal are ['afterDeadline']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier afterDeadline has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier 'afterDeadline' only checks whether the current time is past the deadline, which does not match any of the specified patterns for owner
          restrictions or lock operations.
    Check direct function security
        - function DCY_preICO.safeWithdrawal() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function executes a conditional check for equality with msg.sender (`beneficiary == msg.sender`), but this check does not match any of the specified
          structures directly since `beneficiary` isn't explicitly labeled as an owner or leader. There is no label on 'beneficiary' indicating ownership or leadership
          roles explicitly which aligns with the provided patterns.
        - function DCY_preICO.safeWithdrawal() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon re-evaluation, the code does not strictly match any of the defined structures. The function includes a check for '!fundingGoalReached' but does not
          set 'fundingGoalReached = true' afterward. The only change to 'fundingGoalReached' is setting it to false, which happens under different logic not directly
          after a '!fundingGoalReached' check. Therefore, the code does not satisfy the conditions for structures 1, 2, 3, or 4 as initially thought.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['beneficiary.send(amountRaised)', 'msg.sender.send(amount)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - beneficiary.send(amountRaised) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: This external call contains the
        '.send(' keyword, which satisfies one of the specified characteristics.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - msg.sender.send(amount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: This external call contains the '.send('
        keyword, which satisfies one of the specified characteristics.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
