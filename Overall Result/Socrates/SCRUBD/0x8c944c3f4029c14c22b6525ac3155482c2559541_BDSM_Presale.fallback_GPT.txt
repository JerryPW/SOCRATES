Function Security Analysis for BDSM_Presale.fallback()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
    Check direct function security
        - function BDSM_Presale.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not have any statements where msg.sender is compared directly to an owner or specified address like in the structures given.
        - function BDSM_Presale.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function does contain the structure ```if(!tokensWithdrawn) { tokensWithdrawn = true; ... }``` but there are several operations taking place related
          to token transfer and balance fetching before the state negation of `tokensWithdrawn`. This negation does not occur immediately but rather after several
          important operations, thus it does not satisfy the additional requirement where the negation should happen immediately after the initial condition check.

    Analyze Transfer
        - msg.sender.transfer(msg.value-sendETH) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains
        the '.transfer(' keyword: 'msg.sender.transfer(msg.value-sendETH)'.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - sharesTokenAddress.transfer(safeContract,sharesTokenAddress.balanceOf(this)) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - msg.sender.transfer(msg.value-actualETHTransfer) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        contains the '.transfer(' keyword: 'msg.sender.transfer(msg.value-actualETHTransfer)'.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - owner.transfer(sendETH) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the '.transfer('
        keyword: 'owner.transfer(sendETH)'.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - sharesTokenAddress.transfer(msg.sender,tokenToBuy) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - msg.sender.transfer(msg.value) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the
        '.transfer(' keyword: 'msg.sender.transfer(msg.value)'.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - sharesTokenAddress.transfer(msg.sender,tokenFree) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - owner.transfer(actualETHTransfer) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the
        '.transfer(' keyword: 'owner.transfer(actualETHTransfer)'.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - sharesTokenAddress.balanceOf(this) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - sharesTokenAddress.transfer(safeContract,sharesTokenAddress.balanceOf(this)) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - sharesTokenAddress.transfer(msg.sender,tokenToBuy) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - sharesTokenAddress.transfer(msg.sender,tokenFree) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['sharesTokenAddress.balanceOf(this)', 'sharesTokenAddress.transfer(safeContract,sharesTokenAddress.balanceOf(this))',
    'sharesTokenAddress.transfer(msg.sender,tokenToBuy)', 'sharesTokenAddress.transfer(msg.sender,tokenFree)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['sharesTokenAddress'] should be checked in variable sharesTokenAddress
        Checked variables: sharesTokenAddress
            Yes The given code is a constructor because the function name matches the contract name BDSM_Presale. This satisfies the first characteristic of the provided
            rules. Furthermore, the code does hardcode the state variable sharesTokenAddress with the value of token(_tokenAddress), satisfying the second characteristic
            as well.
        There are ['sharesTokenAddress'] should be checked in variable sharesTokenAddress
        Checked variables: sharesTokenAddress
            Yes The provided code is a constructor function because the function name 'BDSM_Presale' matches the contract name 'BDSM_Presale'. Therefore, it satisfies the
            first characteristic in the given conditions, related to checking whether the provided code is a constructor. The state variable 'sharesTokenAddress' is set
            within the constructor but is not hardcoded, as it is assigned using the parameter '_tokenAddress'. Thus, it does not satisfy the second characteristic.
        There are ['sharesTokenAddress'] should be checked in variable sharesTokenAddress
        Checked variables: sharesTokenAddress
            Yes The given function is named 'BDSM_Presale', which matches the contract name 'BDSM_Presale'. This indicates that the function is a constructor, meeting
            characteristic 1.
        There are ['sharesTokenAddress'] should be checked in variable sharesTokenAddress
        Checked variables: sharesTokenAddress
            Yes The function name 'BDSM_Presale' matches the contract name 'BDSM_Presale', indicating that it is a constructor. Constructors in Solidity do not require
            the 'function' keyword and the name matching is sufficient for older versions of Solidity. This satisfies characteristic 1.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
