Function Security Analysis for Contagion.Sort()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function Sort.
    Check direct function security
        - function Contagion.Sort() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not check for the identity of `msg.sender` against any kind of owner or authorized address.
        - function Contagion.Sort() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not have any 'require' statements or 'if' statements with 'throw' that match the specified structures. It only initializes and modifies
          some variables and arrays.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['fallback']
        Function Security Analysis for Contagion.fallback()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
            Check direct function security
                - function Contagion.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The provided function does not have any restrictive or assertive condition based on 'msg.sender != xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO' or equivalent
                  as per the specified structures. The check 'if (msg.sender == owner)' is using the 'msg.sender == xxxOwner' condition, which is not restrictive or
                  assertive and thus does not match the specified structures for restriction or assertion.
                - function Contagion.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the required structures specifying a variable check followed by a change in its value as per specified
                  patterns.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['owner.send(feecounter)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - owner.send(feecounter) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the '.send('
        keyword, which is one of the specified characteristics to look for.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
