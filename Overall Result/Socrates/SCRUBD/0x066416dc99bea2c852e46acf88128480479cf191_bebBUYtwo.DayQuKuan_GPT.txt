Function Security Analysis for bebBUYtwo.DayQuKuan()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function DayQuKuan.
    Check direct function security
        - function bebBUYtwo.DayQuKuan() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not use 'msg.sender' in any of the specified conditional structures or require statements.
        - function bebBUYtwo.DayQuKuan() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code checks a `require` condition but does not contain any of the specified structures where a boolean variable is flipped after a requirement. None
          of the specified structures are present in the code.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['bebTokenTransfer.transfer(msg.sender,_bebs)', 'msg.sender.transfer(_users.dayamount)', 'bebTokenTransfer.transfer(msg.sender,_bebss)',
    'bebTokenTransfer.transfer(msg.sender,_values)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - bebTokenTransfer.transfer(msg.sender,_bebs) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - msg.sender.transfer(_users.dayamount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains
        '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - bebTokenTransfer.transfer(msg.sender,_bebss) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - bebTokenTransfer.transfer(msg.sender,_values) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - bebTokenTransfer.transfer(msg.sender,_bebs) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - bebTokenTransfer.transfer(msg.sender,_bebss) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - bebTokenTransfer.transfer(msg.sender,_values) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['bebTokenTransfer.transfer(msg.sender,_bebs)', 'bebTokenTransfer.transfer(msg.sender,_bebss)',
    'bebTokenTransfer.transfer(msg.sender,_values)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['bebTokenTransfer'] should be checked in variable bebTokenTransfer
        Checked variables: bebTokenTransfer
            Yes The code contains a function named 'bebBUYtwo', which matches the contract name 'bebBUYtwo'. This suggests that the function is a constructor for the
            contract. Even though the Solidity compiler version is not specified and the function is not explicitly marked as 'constructor', the matching function name
            and contract name indicate that it is likely intended to be a constructor.
        There are ['bebTokenTransfer'] should be checked in variable bebTokenTransfer
        Checked variables: bebTokenTransfer
            Yes The function name 'bebBUYtwo' matches the contract name, 'bebBUYtwo', which indicates that this function is a constructor. Constructors are special
            functions that have the same name as the contract before Solidity version 0.4.22 or are specifically labeled as 'constructor' in newer versions.
        There are ['bebTokenTransfer'] should be checked in variable bebTokenTransfer
        Checked variables: bebTokenTransfer
            Yes The function name 'bebBUYtwo' matches the contract name 'bebBUYtwo'. This indicates that the function is acting as a constructor in the context of this
            smart contract, thus satisfying the first characteristic.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
