Function Security Analysis for KittyBreeding.giveBirth(uint256)
    The modifier of function giveBirth are ['whenNotPaused']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier whenNotPaused has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier checks if the contract is paused, but it does not enforce specific ownership or lock mechanism based on the rules provided.
    Check direct function security
        - function KittyBreeding.giveBirth(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain structures that involve checking the msg.sender directly against an owner or similar administrative role (e.g.,
          xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO) using any of the specified conditions.
        - function KittyBreeding.giveBirth(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not match any of the structures described. It includes checks and subsequent operations, but not in the format specified by the
          conditions, such as requiring a condition between true/false and then resetting a variable to its opposite value straight after.

    Analyze External Address
        There are ['geneScience'] should be checked in variable geneScience
        Checked variables: geneScience
            No The function 'setGeneScienceAddress' is not a constructor as its name does not match the contract name 'KittyBreeding', nor is it explicitly named
            'constructor'. Additionally, the function sets the 'geneScience' state variable using a parameter and a contract interface, not a hard-coded value.
            Function Security Analysis for KittyBreeding.setGeneScienceAddress(address)
                The modifier of function setGeneScienceAddress are ['onlyCEO']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyCEO is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The modifier contains the statement 'require(msg.sender == ceoAddress);', which enforces that only the CEO can execute the function. This
                      matches the structure described in the first characteristic, specifically enforcing ownership control. There is no lock structure present in the
                      code that would match the description of the second characteristic.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
