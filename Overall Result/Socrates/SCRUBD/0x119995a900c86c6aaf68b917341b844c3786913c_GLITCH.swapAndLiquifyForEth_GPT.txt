Function Security Analysis for GLITCH.swapAndLiquifyForEth(uint256)
    The modifier of function swapAndLiquifyForEth are ['lockTheSwap']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier lockTheSwap is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The modifier `lockTheSwap` uses a lock operation by setting `inSwapAndLiquify` to true before the function and resets it to false afterward, ensuring
          the function enters only once. Both lock and unlock operations are present, fulfilling the requirements of structure 2 completely.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

    Check direct function security
        - function GLITCH._sendRewardInterestToPool() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The provided function does not include any statements that check the sender address against a specified owner, address, leader, or CEO. It does not
          match any of the listed structures.
        - function GLITCH._sendRewardInterestToPool() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided function does not contain any 'require' or 'throw' statements, nor does it modify or check any boolean variable ('xxx'). Hence, it does not
          match any of the four specified structures.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['swapAndLiquifyForTokens', 'transfer', 'transferFrom', 'swapAndLiquifyForEth', '_transfer']
        Function Security Analysis for GLITCH.swapAndLiquifyForTokens(address,uint256)
            The modifier of function swapAndLiquifyForTokens are ['lockTheSwap']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier lockTheSwap is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The modifier lockTheSwap sets the flag inSwapAndLiquify to true before the function executes and resets it to false afterward, matching the lock
                  and unlock operation criteria fully. Thus, it satisfies characteristic 2.
        Function Security Analysis for GLITCH.transfer(address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transfer.
            Check direct function security
                - function GLITCH.transfer(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not check or make assertions about the msg.sender being a specific owner or address role like Owner/Leader/CEO. It only uses
                  it to transfer tokens.
                - function GLITCH.transfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures. It is a simple transfer function that calls another function and returns
                  true.

    Analyze External Address
        There are ['currentPoolAddress'] should be checked in variable currentPoolAddress
        Checked variables: currentPoolAddress
            Yes The provided code contains a constructor function for the contract named 'GLITCH'. This is evident as the code snippet includes a function explicitly
            named 'constructor'. In this constructor, the state variable 'currentPoolAddress' is being set using hardcoded logic in combination with the provided function
            arguments. This satisfies both characteristics listed for identification: the function is a constructor, and it also hardcodes a state variable.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Function Security Analysis for GLITCH._transfer(address,address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _transfer.
    Check direct function security
        - function GLITCH._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not include any control structure that exactly matches the structures mentioned, such as checking msg.sender against an owner or
          authorized address.
        - function GLITCH._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures involving the 'require' statements and variable assignments as per the given patterns.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['swapAndLiquifyForTokens', 'transferFrom', 'swapAndLiquifyForEth', 'transfer', '_transfer']
        Function Security Analysis for GLITCH.swapAndLiquifyForTokens(address,uint256)
            The modifier of function swapAndLiquifyForTokens are ['lockTheSwap']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier lockTheSwap is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The modifier lockTheSwap contains both a lock operation (inSwapAndLiquify = true;) and an unlock operation (inSwapAndLiquify = false;). These
                  operations ensure that the function is executed in a non-reentrant way. Since both operations are present, it satisfies the lock operation requirement
                  for structure 2.
        Function Security Analysis for GLITCH.transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transferFrom.
            Check direct function security
                - function GLITCH.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any checks or assertions related to msg.sender's value, such as requiring, checking with if, throwing, or
                  asserting that msg.sender matches a specific owner or leader address.
                - function GLITCH.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures (1, 2, 3, or 4). There are no 'require' statements or 'if throw' statements along with
                  assignment operations as described.

Start analyze function: GLITCH.swapAndLiquifyForTokens(address,uint256)
Function Security Analysis for GLITCH.swapAndLiquifyForTokens(address,uint256)
    The modifier of function swapAndLiquifyForTokens are ['lockTheSwap']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier lockTheSwap is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The modifier "lockTheSwap" sets the flag "inSwapAndLiquify" to true before and resets it to false after the function execution, which matches the
          requirement for a lock operation. Both lock and unlock operations are present in the code structure, satisfying rule 2.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
