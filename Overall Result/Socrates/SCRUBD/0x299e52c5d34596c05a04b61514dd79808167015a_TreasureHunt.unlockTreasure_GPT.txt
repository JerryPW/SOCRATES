Function Security Analysis for TreasureHunt.unlockTreasure(bytes32)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function unlockTreasure.
    Check direct function security
        - function TreasureHunt.unlockTreasure(bytes32) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The given code does not check the sender against any specified Owner/Address/Leader/CEO conditions. No msg.sender validations against specific roles or
          addresses are present.
        - function TreasureHunt.unlockTreasure(bytes32) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon re-evaluation, the code does not strictly follow the structure required for the conditions provided. It does not contain the sequences needed as it
          only has the first statement `require(isActive, "treasure inactive");` but does not have a corresponding `isActive = true;` statement preceding the usage of
          `isActive = false;`. Thus, the conditions of either structure being fully met are not satisfied.

    Analyze Transfer
        - IERC20(DGX_TOKEN_ADDRESS).transfer(msg.sender,_dgxBalance) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - IERC20(DGX_TOKEN_ADDRESS).transfer(msg.sender,_dgxBalance) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['IERC20(DGX_TOKEN_ADDRESS).transfer(msg.sender,_dgxBalance)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['DGX_TOKEN_ADDRESS'] should be checked in variable DGX_TOKEN_ADDRESS
        Checked variables: DGX_TOKEN_ADDRESS
            Yes The function in the provided code is explicitly named 'constructor', indicating that it is a constructor function. In Solidity, constructor functions are
            special functions that are executed once when the contract is deployed. They have the same name as the contract in older Solidity versions or are explicitly
            named 'constructor'. This function also sets the state variable 'DGX_TOKEN_ADDRESS', but it does not hardcode it (it's set via the '_dgx_token_address'
            parameter). Therefore, the function satisfies the first characteristic of being a constructor.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
