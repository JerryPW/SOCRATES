Function Security Analysis for NamiPool._withdrawNAC(address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _withdrawNAC.
    Check direct function security
        - function NamiPool._withdrawNAC(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not include any checks involving msg.sender and therefore does not satisfy any of the specified structures that involve msg.sender
          verification.
        - function NamiPool._withdrawNAC(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code contains a line `require(namiPool[_roundIndex][_shareAddress].stake > 0);` which does not match any of the structures specified in the
          prompt. There are no subsequent assignments to the variable checked in the require statement that would match the patterns described.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['withdrawNonTopForTeam', 'withdrawTopForTeam', 'withdrawTop', 'withdrawNonTop']
        Function Security Analysis for NamiPool.withdrawNonTopForTeam(address,uint256)
            The modifier of function withdrawNonTopForTeam are ['onlyEscrow']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyEscrow is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The code contains a require statement that enforces that only the escrow address can execute the function. The line `require(msg.sender ==
                  escrow);` matches rule 1, which verifies that the function is only executable by a specific address. There are no lock and unlock operations present, so
                  rule 2 is not applicable.
        Function Security Analysis for NamiPool.withdrawTopForTeam(address,uint256)
            The modifier of function withdrawTopForTeam are ['onlyEscrow']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyEscrow is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The code contains the statement 'require(msg.sender == escrow);' in the modifier 'onlyEscrow', which checks if the sender of the message is the
                  'escrow' address. This structure enforces that only a specific address ('escrow') can execute the function, satisfying characteristic 1. There is no
                  evidence of a lock operation structure, so characteristic 2 does not apply here.
        Function Security Analysis for NamiPool.withdrawTop(uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function withdrawTop.
            Check direct function security
                - function NamiPool.withdrawTop(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code has checks using require that relate to the function of the contract but does not verify the authority of the msg.sender against an
                  'Owner' or similar control entity.
                - function NamiPool.withdrawTop(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures since it uses 'require' statements, but they do not assign a value to the same
                  variable that was checked with 'require'.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['namiToken.balanceOf(this)', 'namiToken.transfer(_shareAddress,namiPool[_roundIndex][_shareAddress].stake)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - namiToken.transfer(_shareAddress,namiPool[_roundIndex][_shareAddress].stake) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - namiToken.balanceOf(this) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - namiToken.transfer(_shareAddress,namiPool[_roundIndex][_shareAddress].stake) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['namiToken.balanceOf(this)', 'namiToken.transfer(_shareAddress,namiPool[_roundIndex][_shareAddress].stake)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['NamiAddr'] should be checked in variable namiToken
        Checked variables: NamiAddr
            Yes The function NamiPool matches the contract name and initializes its state variables, indicating it is a constructor. Hence, it satisfies the first
            characteristic.
        There are ['NamiAddr'] should be checked in variable namiToken
        Checked variables: NamiAddr
            Yes 1. The function name 'NamiPool' matches the contract name, indicating that it is a constructor. 2. The function also assigns the value of the parameter
            '_namiAddress' to the state variable 'NamiAddr' and does not hardcode a specific value for 'NamiAddr'. Thus, it does not satisfy the second characteristic
            evaluated.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
