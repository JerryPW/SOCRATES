Function Security Analysis for Multiplier.singleRefunding()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function singleRefunding.
    Check direct function security
        - function Multiplier.singleRefunding() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: There's no check of 'msg.sender' against any specific owner or leader address in the function.
        - function Multiplier.singleRefunding() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures with 'require' or 'if'.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['fallback']
        Function Security Analysis for Multiplier.fallback()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
            Check direct function security
                - function Multiplier.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not check for msg.sender to be a specific 'Owner', 'Address', 'Leader', or 'CEO'. It mainly checks the condition related to
                  msg.value, msg.sender for being an owner but not using keywords mentioned, and uses msg.sender in transaction logic without restricting to owner or
                  certain address specifically based on msg.sender. Hence, none of the specific structures of interest are matched.
                - function Multiplier.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: Upon closer inspection, the code only contains 'require(!isContract(msg.sender));'. The requirement '!isContract(msg.sender)' is present, but
                  there is no subsequent 'isContract(msg.sender) = True;' or similar statement that matches patterns 2 or 3. Therefore, the code does not fit any of the
                  required structures as both required statements are not present.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['dep.depositor.send(amount)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - dep.depositor.send(amount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains '.send('
        keyword, satisfying the second characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
