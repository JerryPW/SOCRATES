    Analyze External Address
        The variable 'token' in external call 'IERC20(token).transfer(_msgSender(),rewardsSent)' has no state variable assigned. Therefore we check whether it has been
        hardcoded in the function.
            No The function 'claimTokenRewards' takes 'token' as an argument, which is an address. The 'token' is used in the function to interact with the IERC20
            interface methods 'balanceOf' and 'transfer'. The presence of 'token' as an argument indicates that this function is modular and can handle different ERC20
            tokens as specified by the user. This means 'token' is not hardcoded, as the function caller can specify the token address each time the function is called.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
