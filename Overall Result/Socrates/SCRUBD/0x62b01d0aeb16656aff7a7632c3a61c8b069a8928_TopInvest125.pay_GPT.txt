Function Security Analysis for TopInvest125.pay()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function pay.
    Check direct function security
        - function TopInvest125.pay() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any conditions or assertions that compare msg.sender to an owner or leader address.
        - function TopInvest125.pay() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures using 'require' or 'if' with a throw statement for variable xxx.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['fallback']
        Function Security Analysis for TopInvest125.fallback()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
            Check direct function security
                - function TopInvest125.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures such as a require or if statement checking if msg.sender is or isn't equal to an
                  owner, address, leader, or CEO. The checks in the code are related to gas and value limits instead.
                - function TopInvest125.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code includes require statements for specific gas and value constraints, but these do not match the required structures involving boolean
                  state changes of a variable. The criteria need the specific sequence of checking a boolean condition and changing the state of the same boolean
                  variable, which is not present here.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['dep.depositor.send(dep.expect)', 'dep.depositor.send(money)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - dep.depositor.send(dep.expect) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains '.send('
        keyword, satisfying the condition for matching rule 2.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - dep.depositor.send(money) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains '.send('
        keyword, satisfying the condition for matching rule 2.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
