Function Security Analysis for BEAST._transfer(address,address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _transfer.
    Check direct function security
        - function BEAST._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code includes if (msg.sender != pair) {...}, but does not involve a check against an xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO type of entity.
        - function BEAST._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code doesn't fulfill any of the specified structures precisely: there is no 'require' statement followed by both changing the same variable to true
          or false, or using if-throw structure with logical assignment as described. It checks for 'require(xxx == True)' or 'require(xxx == False)' patterns with
          accompanying opposite assignments to the same variable, which do not occur in the given code.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transferFrom', 'transfer']
        Function Security Analysis for BEAST.transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transferFrom.
            Check direct function security
                - function BEAST.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not include any authorization checks related to a specific address like xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO with either 'require',
                  'if', or 'assert' as specified.
                - function BEAST.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the required structures: there are no 'require' statements or 'if' conditions with 'throw' related to
                  the same variable being updated subsequently as specified in the conditions.

    Analyze External Address
        There are ['bensRevival'] should be checked in variable bensRevival
        Checked variables: bensRevival
            Yes 1. The function code provided is a constructor for the contract 'BEAST'. It is explicitly named 'constructor', which matches the requirement for
            characteristic 1. 2. The state variable 'bensRevival' is being set with a new instance of 'BensRevival', demonstrating that this variable is hardcoded
            directly in the constructor.
        There are ['bensRevival'] should be checked in variable bensRevival
        Checked variables: bensRevival
            Yes The provided code is a constructor for the contract BEAST. This is determined by the presence of a function named 'constructor'. In Solidity, a function
            explicitly named 'constructor' is recognized as a constructor function, which satisfies the first characteristic listed for evaluation.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: BEAST.swapBack()
Function Security Analysis for BEAST.swapBack()
    The modifier of function swapBack are ['lockTheSwap']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier lockTheSwap is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The code segment provided shows that the modifier 'lockTheSwap' employs a lock mechanism by setting 'inSwapAndLiquify' to 'true' before the execution of
          the function and resetting it to 'false' afterwards. This matches the lock operation structure described in rule 2.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
