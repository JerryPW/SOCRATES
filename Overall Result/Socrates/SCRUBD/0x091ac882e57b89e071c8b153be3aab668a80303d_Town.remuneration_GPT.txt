Function Security Analysis for Town.remuneration(uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function remuneration.
    Check direct function security
        - function Town.remuneration(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not have any require, if, or assert statements checking msg.sender against a specific owner, address, leader, or CEO pattern as mentioned
          in the conditions.
        - function Town.remuneration(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided function does not contain any of the required code patterns. It is mostly focused on transferring tokens and calculating debt without any
          of the specified require patterns or if-throw statements.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['_token.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),restOfTokens)', '_token.transferFrom(msg.sender,user,amount)',
    'msg.sender.transfer(address(this).balance)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - msg.sender.transfer(address(this).balance) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        'msg.sender.transfer(address(this).balance)' contains '.transfer(' keyword. So it satisfies the first characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - _token.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),restOfTokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - _token.transferFrom(msg.sender,user,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['_token.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),restOfTokens)', '_token.transferFrom(msg.sender,user,amount)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['_token'] should be checked in variable _token
        Checked variables: _token
            Yes The provided code is a constructor function. This is evident because the function is explicitly named 'constructor'. According to rule 1, constructors
            satisfy the characteristic we are checking for.
        There are ['_token'] should be checked in variable _token
        Checked variables: _token
            Yes The provided function is explicitly named 'constructor', which matches the constructor requirement as per the first characteristic. The code initializes
            various state variables, including '_token', but since the function is a constructor, it inherently satisfies the first characteristic regardless of its
            operations.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
