Function Security Analysis for Lottery10ETH.drawing()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function drawing.
    Check direct function security
        - function Lottery10ETH.drawing() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The given function does not contain any require, if, or assert statements that check msg.sender against xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
        - function Lottery10ETH.drawing() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code snippet provided does not match any of the given required structures because it does not contain any 'require' statements with a 'true'/
          'false' condition or 'if(!xxx) throw' constructs that fulfill these specific patterns. The only 'require' statement checks if 'block.number > futureblock',
          which is unrelated to checking a boolean variable in the specified manner.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['fallback']
        Function Security Analysis for Lottery10ETH.fallback()
            The modifier of function fallback are ['notFromContract']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier notFromContract has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier checks if the call is made by a contract or not, but it does not enforce that only the owner or specific addresses can execute the
                  function, and it does not implement a lock operation to ensure the function enters only once. It also doesn't imply these characteristics through its
                  name.
            Check direct function security
                - function Lottery10ETH.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not have any of the specified checks or structures related to msg.sender.
                - function Lottery10ETH.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures with 'require(xxx == True);', 'require(xxx == False);', 'require(!xxx);', or
                  'if(!xxx) throw;'. None of these conditions are followed by the same variable being set to 'True' or 'False'.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['msg.sender.send(txCost)', 'WT.emitEvent(players[winnerIdx])', 'x.count()', 'WT.emitEvent(winner)', 'RS.sendBonus(addresses[k])',
    'owner.send(fee)', 'x.draw(goldenWinners)', 'players[winnerIdx].send(brilliant[1])', 'winner.send(silver[1])', 'WT.emitEvent(addresses[k])',
    'addresses[k].send(goldenPrize)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - msg.sender.send(txCost) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call 'msg.sender.send(txCost)' contains
        the '.send(' keyword, satisfying characteristic 2.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - owner.send(fee) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call 'owner.send(fee)' contains the '.send('
        keyword, satisfying characteristic 2.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - players[winnerIdx].send(brilliant[1]) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call
        'players[winnerIdx].send(brilliant[1])' contains the '.send(' keyword, satisfying characteristic 2.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - winner.send(silver[1]) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call 'winner.send(silver[1])' contains
        the '.send(' keyword, satisfying characteristic 2.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - addresses[k].send(goldenPrize) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call
        'addresses[k].send(goldenPrize)' contains the '.send(' keyword, satisfying characteristic 2.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - WT.emitEvent(players[winnerIdx]) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - x.count() ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - WT.emitEvent(winner) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - RS.sendBonus(addresses[k]) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - x.draw(goldenWinners) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - WT.emitEvent(addresses[k]) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['WT.emitEvent(players[winnerIdx])', 'x.count()', 'WT.emitEvent(winner)', 'RS.sendBonus(addresses[k])', 'x.draw(goldenWinners)',
    'WT.emitEvent(addresses[k])']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['WT'] should be checked in variable WT
        Checked variables: WT
            Yes The provided code is a constructor since the function name 'constructor' explicitly indicates it. Additionally, the state variable 'WT' is explicitly
            assigned a new instance of the 'WinnerTicket()', which is a hardcoded value in this context.
        There are ['x'] should be checked in variable x
        Checked variables: x
            Yes 1. The function 'constructor' in the provided code matches the contract name 'Lottery10ETH'. This means it is a constructor for the contract. 2. The
            function initializes the state variable `x` by creating a new `Storage` instance, which is part of typical constructor behavior to establish the initial
            state.
        There are ['WT'] should be checked in variable WT
        Checked variables: WT
            Yes The function provided in the code has the same name 'constructor', which matches characteristic 1 for a constructor.
        There are ['RS'] should be checked in variable RS
        Checked variables: RS
            Yes The function provided in the code snippet is explicitly named 'constructor'. According to the characteristic that checks if the function name matches
            'constructor', it indicates that this function is indeed a constructor. Constructors in Solidity are special functions that are executed once when the
            contract is deployed and often used for setting up the initial states and variables. This satisfies the first characteristic provided.
        There are ['x'] should be checked in variable x
        Checked variables: x
            Yes 1. The code contains a constructor: The function named 'constructor' is the constructor, as identified by the explicit naming of 'constructor'. This
            matches Rule 1. 2. The code does not have any other occurrences of hardcoded state variables from those provided.
        There are ['WT'] should be checked in variable WT
        Checked variables: WT
            Yes The provided code is a constructor for the contract 'Lottery10ETH' as it does not appear to have a name but is explicitly indicated by the keyword
            'constructor'.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
