Function Security Analysis for BoomerangLiquidity.payout()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function payout.
    Check direct function security
        - function BoomerangLiquidity.payout() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any check or condition that restricts the function execution based on the sender's address. It lacks any require, if,
          or assert statements related to msg.sender being checked against an owner, address, etc.
        - function BoomerangLiquidity.payout() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code contains the statement `require(balance > 1);` but there is no subsequent assignment to `balance = False` or `balance = True`. Therefore, none
          of the specified structures are present in the code.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['weak_hands.buy.value(investment).gas(1000000)(msg.sender)', 'participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.send(payoutToSend)',
    'participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.call.value(payoutToSend).gas(1000000)()']
    Analyze Transfer
        - participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.send(payoutToSend) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The
        external call contains the '.send(' keyword, satisfying the second characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - The gas limit in weak_hands.buy.value(investment).gas(1000000)(msg.sender) is 1000000, which is too high. Therefore, it will not prevent REE problem.
        - The gas limit in participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.call.value(payoutToSend).gas(1000000)() is 1000000, which is too high. Therefore, it will not prevent
        REE problem.
    Remaining external call: ['weak_hands.buy.value(investment).gas(1000000)(msg.sender)',
    'participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.call.value(payoutToSend).gas(1000000)()']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['weak_hands'] should be checked in variable weak_hands
        Checked variables: weak_hands
            Yes The function named 'BoomerangLiquidity' matches the contract name 'BoomerangLiquidity', indicating that this function is likely a constructor. Typically,
            constructors are used to initialize state variables during contract deployment, which is the purpose of this function as it sets initial values for
            'multiplier', 'powh_address', and 'weak_hands'. Therefore, it satisfies characteristic 1.
        There are ['participants'] should be checked in variable participants
        Checked variables: participants
            No 1. The function is not named after the contract name 'BoomerangLiquidity' nor is it explicitly named 'constructor', so it is not a constructor. 2. The
            function does not hardcode the state variable 'participants'. The state variable 'participants' is manipulated programmatically through operations like
            'push', but it is not assigned a hardcoded value.
            Function Security Analysis for BoomerangLiquidity.deposit()
                There are no modifiers should be examined in function deposit.
                Check direct function security
                    - function BoomerangLiquidity.deposit() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                      Reason: The code provided does not contain any checks or conditions related to the `msg.sender` identity such as a comparison to an owner or
                      specific address, nor does it restrict function access based on the sender.
                    - function BoomerangLiquidity.deposit() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                      Reason: The provided code does not satisfy any of the given structures.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
