Start analyze function: Brave3d.buyByAddress(address)
Function Security Analysis for Brave3d.buyByAddress(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function buyByAddress.
    Check direct function security
        - function Brave3d.buyByAddress(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The provided function does not perform any checks matching the specified characteristics involving msg.sender with respect to specific roles like
          xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO.
        - function Brave3d.buyByAddress(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code has a 'require(false)' statement but does not follow with an assignment related to the variable mentioned in the structures provided.
          Therefore, the code does not match any of the outlined structures.

Start analyze function: Brave3d.overStage(uint8)
Function Security Analysis for Brave3d.overStage(uint8)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function overStage.
    Check direct function security
        - function Brave3d.overStage(uint8) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The given function does not include any checks involving msg.sender that relate to ownership, leadership or specific address checks as outlined in the
          characteristics provided.
        - function Brave3d.overStage(uint8) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon re-evaluating, the code contains 'assert(!finishStage.isFinish);' but does not explicitly set 'finishStage.isFinish = True;' right after. Instead,
          it sets 'finishStage.isFinish = true;' after some other operations, but not directly following the assertion. Therefore, the complete structure for pattern 3
          does not fully match because both the require and immediate setting to True must occur in short sequence for a full match. Therefore, none of the given
          structures 1, 2, 3, or 4 strictly match as originally evaluated.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['forceOverStage', 'buyByName', 'buyByAddress', 'setName', 'buyFromValue', 'withdraw']
        Function Security Analysis for Brave3d.forceOverStage()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function forceOverStage.
            Check direct function security
                - function Brave3d.forceOverStage() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function forceOverStage has no checks or conditions involving msg.sender, so no structures that would lead to a 'Yes' judgment are present.
                - function Brave3d.forceOverStage() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The given code does not include any structure that matches the provided patterns. There are no 'require' or 'if' statements with conditions
                  related to the variable changing as specified.
