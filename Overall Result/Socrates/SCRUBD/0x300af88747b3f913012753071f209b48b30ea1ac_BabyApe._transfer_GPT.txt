    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _transfer.
    Check direct function security
        - function BabyApe._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not include any require, if, or assert statements that check if msg.sender is or is not xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO or similar roles.
        - function BabyApe._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon re-evaluation, the previous response was incorrect. The code contains the statement `require(!bots[sender] && !bots[recipient]);`, which partially
          matches the structure `{require(!xxx);}`, but it does not contain a subsequent statement `xxx = True;`. Since both statements are required for a match, none of
          the specified structures are fully satisfied.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transfer', 'transferFrom']
        Function Security Analysis for BabyApe.transfer(address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transfer.
            Check direct function security
                - function BabyApe.transfer(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures related to the use of msg.sender in security checks.
                - function BabyApe.transfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The function does not contain any require statement or an if statement with a throw. It is simply a function that performs actions and returns
                  true directly.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['dividendDistributor.process(distributorGas)', 'dividendDistributor.setShare(sender,_balances[sender])',
    'dividendDistributor.setShare(recipient,_balances[recipient])']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - dividendDistributor.process(distributorGas) is subjected to gas limits distributorGas <= 3000. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason:
        The code provided is a smart contract written in Solidity defining the 'BabyApe' token. Within this contract, there is a variable named 'distributorGas' which is
        assigned a value of 500,000 at the time of contract deployment. The 'distributorGas' represents the maximum gas amount that will be used when processing dividend
        distributions.   Upon reviewing the entire contract code, there are no sections where this 'distributorGas' variable is being modified or reassigned; it remains
        constant. Therefore, based on this code, the 'distributorGas' will always have a value of 500,000, which is indeed less than 3,000. There is no operation or
        function that alters this initial assignment.  Thus, because 'distributorGas' is always assigned a value of 500,000, which is less than 3,000, the answer is True.
        - dividendDistributor.setShare(sender,_balances[sender]) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - dividendDistributor.setShare(recipient,_balances[recipient]) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['dividendDistributor.setShare(sender,_balances[sender])', 'dividendDistributor.setShare(recipient,_balances[recipient])']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['dividendDistributor'] should be checked in variable dividendDistributor
        Checked variables: dividendDistributor
            Yes The provided code includes a function named 'constructor', which matches the second characteristic criteria since it's explicitly named as a constructor.
            Whether there is a state variable hardcoded is irrelevant here because the first condition is already satisfied.
        There are ['dividendDistributor'] should be checked in variable dividendDistributor
        Checked variables: dividendDistributor
            Yes The provided code is a constructor for the contract named 'BabyApe'. It is explicitly defined as a constructor and matches the contract's name, thus
            satisfying the first characteristic.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: BabyApe.swapBack()
Function Security Analysis for BabyApe.swapBack()
    The modifier of function swapBack are ['lockTheSwap']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier lockTheSwap is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: Upon reviewing the given code, the 'lockTheSwap' modifier sets a flag 'inSwapAndLiquify' to true before the function runs and resets it to false
          afterward. This clearly matches both the lock and unlock operations required to ensure that the function enters only once (rule 2).
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
