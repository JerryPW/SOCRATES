    There are no modifiers should be examined in function getMoney.
    Check direct function security
        - function EscrowGoods.getMoney(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code doesn't contain any access control mechanism that checks if msg.sender equals or doesn't equal a specific owner or role, such as Owner, Leader,
          CEO, etc., through the require, if, or assert statements.
        - function EscrowGoods.getMoney(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures, such as 'require' or 'if(!xxx) throw' followed by an alteration of the same
          variable. The function is performing checks using 'if' statements and follows by actions within different branches but does not strictly match any of the given
          structures.

Function Security Analysis for EscrowGoods.safeSend(address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function safeSend.
    Check direct function security
        - function EscrowGoods.safeSend(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function only checks for an `atomicLock` before proceeding with its operation, and does not contain msg.sender conditions to restrict access based
          on ownership or authority.
        - function EscrowGoods.safeSend(address,uint256) has security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The code matches structure 4. However, after the check 'if(atomicLock) throw;', which matches the first condition in the structure 4, 'atomicLock =
          true;' is immediately executed, which negates the state of 'atomicLock'. This occurs before any main logic or critical operation, like address calls, is
          performed. The main logic only starts after setting 'atomicLock' to true, satisfying the structural requirement for immediate negation.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
