    Check direct function security
        - function CRYPTOVATOR._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function checks whether 'from', 'to', or other addresses are the owner (using owner() function), but it does not explicitly check 'msg.sender'
          against 'owner' or other designated roles in any require/assert/if statement.
        - function CRYPTOVATOR._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon reviewing the code and requirements again, the previous assessment was incorrect. Based on the structures provided, both statements of a structure
          need to be present to qualify. While the statement 'require(!blackListAdd[from], "You are blacklisted, contact owner to solve this problem.");' matches the
          'require(!xxx)' part of the third structure, there is no subsequent 'blackListAdd[from] = True;' statement. Additionally, there is the statement
          'boughtEarly[to] = true;', but it's associated with a different variable and context, not 'blackListAdd'. Thus, it only partially matches the required pattern
          without fulfilling the requirement of using the same variable for 'xxx'. Therefore, none of the specified structures fully match in the code, leading to a 'No'
          judgment.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transfer', 'transferFrom']
        Function Security Analysis for CRYPTOVATOR.transfer(address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transfer.
            Check direct function security
                - function CRYPTOVATOR.transfer(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain any checks or requirements on msg.sender comparing it to xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO.
                - function CRYPTOVATOR.transfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The given code does not contain any of the specified structures. There is no use of the 'require' keyword or any condition checking and
                  assignment of true/false to a variable named 'xxx'.

Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: CRYPTOVATOR.swapBack()
Function Security Analysis for CRYPTOVATOR.swapBack()
    The modifier of function swapBack are ['lockTheSwap']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier lockTheSwap is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The modifier sets `inSwapAndLiquify` to true before the function runs and resets it to false after, ensuring exclusive entry, which satisfies the lock
          operation requirement in rule 2.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
