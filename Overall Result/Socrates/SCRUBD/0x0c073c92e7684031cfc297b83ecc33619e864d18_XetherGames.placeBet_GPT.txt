    Check direct function security
        - function XetherGames.placeBet(uint256,uint32,uint256,uint256,uint256,bytes32,bytes32) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of
        msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any checks for specific identities of msg.sender, such as checking if msg.sender is equal to an owner or specific address
          like xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO. It only checks general input constraints and signature validity without considering the sender's identity.
        - function XetherGames.placeBet(uint256,uint32,uint256,uint256,uint256,bytes32,bytes32) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: There is no structure in the code that fulfills any of the specified conditions. The required patterns involve a require statement directly followed by
          setting the observed variable. None of the other conditions, such as a direct negation in the require statements followed by a specific assignment, are present
          in this code.

Start analyze function: XetherGames.sendDividends()
Function Security Analysis for XetherGames.sendDividends()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function sendDividends.
    Check direct function security
        - function XetherGames.sendDividends() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not include any checks for msg.sender being a specific owner, leader, or address related to the roles mentioned, such as Owner,
          Leader, or CEO.
        - function XetherGames.sendDividends() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code doesn't follow any of the specified structures involving the use of 'require' or 'if...throw'. The code checks if 'xEtherTokensContract'
          address is not zero and executes corresponding logic, but doesn't use any variable assignments or modify any state inversely as required by the conditions.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['xEtherTokensContract.ecosystemDividends.value(tmpDividends)()']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - xEtherTokensContract.ecosystemDividends.value(tmpDividends)() ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['xEtherTokensContract.ecosystemDividends.value(tmpDividends)()']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['xEtherTokensContract'] should be checked in variable xEtherTokensContract
        Checked variables: xEtherTokensContract
            No 1. The function name 'setXEtherContract' does not match the contract name 'XetherGames', nor is it named 'constructor'. Therefore, it does not satisfy the
            first characteristic.  2. The function 'setXEtherContract' is setting the state variable 'xEtherTokensContract' based on an input parameter 'xEtherContract',
            and not a hardcoded value. Hence, it does not satisfy the second characteristic.
            Function Security Analysis for XetherGames.setXEtherContract(address)
                The modifier of function setXEtherContract are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The modifier onlyOwner contains the statement `require(msg.sender == owner, "OnlyOwner methods called by non-owner.");`, which matches the
                      characteristic listed in rule 1: enforcing that only the owner can execute the function. No lock operation is present, thus rule 2 is not
                      applicable. Rule 3 doesn't apply here as the modifier's function name doesn't provide additional context beyond rule 1 verification.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
