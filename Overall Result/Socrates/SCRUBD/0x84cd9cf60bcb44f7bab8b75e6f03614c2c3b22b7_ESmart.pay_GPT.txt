Start analyze function: ESmart.pay()
Function Security Analysis for ESmart.pay()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function pay.
    Check direct function security
        - function ESmart.pay() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not include any of the specified structures that involve checking the msg.sender against an owner or authority role like xxxOwner,
          xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO.
        - function ESmart.pay() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified patterns, such as checking a condition with 'require' followed by changing a boolean variable.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['fallback']
        Function Security Analysis for ESmart.fallback()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
            Check direct function security
                - function ESmart.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The given function does not contain any of the specified structures checking the identity of the message sender against a specific owner,
                  address, Leader, or CEO. It primarily conducts checks on value, gas requirements, stage, and deposit conditions.
                - function ESmart.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code snippet does not exhibit any of the specified structures that we are checking for.  1. There is no `require(xxx == True)`
                  followed by `xxx = False`. 2. There is no `require(xxx == False)` followed by `xxx = True`. 3. There is no `require(!xxx)` followed by `xxx = True`. 4.
                  There is no `if(!xxx) throw` followed by `xxx = true`.  The `require` statements in the code are performing other checks such as `require(gasleft() >=
                  220000)`, `require(msg.value >= INVESTMENT)`, and other conditions that do not match the required pattern.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['dep.depositor.send(dep.expect)', 'dep.depositor.send(money)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - dep.depositor.send(dep.expect) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: This external call contains the
        '.send(' keyword, which satisfies the second characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - dep.depositor.send(money) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: This external call contains the '.send('
        keyword, which satisfies the second characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
