Function Security Analysis for BabyDubbz._transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _transferFrom.
    Check direct function security
        - function BabyDubbz._transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any conditional checks involving `msg.sender` with roles such as xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO.
        - function BabyDubbz._transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code doesn't match any of the specified structures. It contains 'require' statements, but they are not paired with modifying the same
          boolean variable as per the given patterns.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transfer', 'transferFrom']

            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transfer.
            Check direct function security
                - function BabyDubbz.transfer(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified access control structures like require, if, or assert statements checking msg.sender against
                  a specific owner or leader.
                - function BabyDubbz.transfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain a structure where a variable is required to be true or false and then later set to a different value (true or false).
                  There is no use of 'require' or 'if' with a throw related to a boolean variable that is later altered.

    'distributor.setShare(recipient,balanceOf(recipient))']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - distributor.process(distributorGas) is subjected to gas limits distributorGas <= 3000. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: In the
        provided code snippet, the variable `distributorGas` is set within the function `setDistributorSettings`. The function is controlled by the `require` statement,
        which enforces the condition `gas < 900000`. This guarantees that any assignment to `distributorGas` will always be less than 900,000.  Since there is no way in
        the contract for `distributorGas` to exceed 900,000 and since 900,000 is significantly more than 3,000, it logically follows that `distributorGas` will always be
        less than or equal to 3,000 when this particular variable setting is considered. Therefore, the assignment is always less than or equal to 3,000.
        - distributor.setShare(sender,balanceOf(sender)) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - distributor.setShare(recipient,balanceOf(recipient)) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['distributor.setShare(sender,balanceOf(sender))', 'distributor.setShare(recipient,balanceOf(recipient))']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['distributor'] should be checked in variable distributor
        Checked variables: distributor
            Yes The provided code is a constructor because the function name is omitted, indicating it's an explicit constructor using the 'constructor' keyword.
            Additionally, the code initializes the state variable 'distributor' within this constructor.
        There are ['distributor'] should be checked in variable distributor
        Checked variables: distributor
            Yes The provided code sample is a constructor named 'constructor', which matches the second part of the first characteristic that the function should be named
            'constructor' to be considered. Additionally, within this constructor, the state variable 'distributor' is initialized with a hardcoded value, specifically
            with 'new DividendDistributor(address(router))', satisfying the second characteristic of having hardcoded state variables.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: BabyDubbz.swapBack()
Function Security Analysis for BabyDubbz.swapBack()
    The modifier of function swapBack are ['swapping']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier swapping is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The modifier 'swapping' sets the flag 'inSwap' to true before the function runs and sets it back to false after, indicating both lock and unlock
          operations. Hence, the code structure enforces a lock operation, which satisfies rule 2.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: BabyDubbz.triggerAutoBuyback()
Function Security Analysis for BabyDubbz.triggerAutoBuyback()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function triggerAutoBuyback.
    Check direct function security
        - function BabyDubbz.triggerAutoBuyback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function triggerAutoBuyback lacks any checks that involve msg.sender or similar access control mechanisms focusing on owner or leader roles.
        - function BabyDubbz.triggerAutoBuyback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain 'require' or 'if' statements that match the specified structures.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

        Function Security Analysis for BabyDubbz.transfer(address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transfer.
            Check direct function security
                - function BabyDubbz.transfer(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: None of the required structures (require, if, or assert statements checking msg.sender) are present in the code.
                - function BabyDubbz.transfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The given code does not contain any of the specified structures such as 'require(xxx == True); xxx = False;', 'require(xxx == False); xxx =
                  True;', 'require(!xxx); xxx = True;', or 'if(!xxx) throw; xxx = true;'. It simply executes a transfer operation without additional conditions or
                  modifications of a boolean variable.

Start analyze function: BabyDubbz.buyTokens(uint256,address)
Function Security Analysis for BabyDubbz.buyTokens(uint256,address)
    The modifier of function buyTokens are ['swapping']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier swapping is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The code in the modifier sets the flag 'inSwap' to true at the start and resets it to false at the end, which matches both parts of the lock operation
          indicating the function can only be entered once at a time.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
