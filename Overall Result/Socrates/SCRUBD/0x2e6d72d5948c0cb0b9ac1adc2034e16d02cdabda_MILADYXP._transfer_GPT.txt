    Check direct function security
        - function MILADYXP._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified patterns related to msg.sender checking for owner or specific addresses.
        - function MILADYXP._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified patterns with the 'require' or 'if' statements directly leading to setting a boolean variable to true or
          false.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transfer', 'transferFrom']
        Function Security Analysis for MILADYXP.transfer(address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transfer.
            Check direct function security
                - function MILADYXP.transfer(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function code provided does not include any check or assertion that compares `msg.sender` to a specific owner or authorized address. It
                  simply calls another function `_transfer` with `msg.sender` as one of the parameters, and there are no conditional structures that match the criteria
                  given.
                - function MILADYXP.transfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code provided does not contain any `require` or `if(!xxx) throw` statement, nor does it involve changing a boolean variable within those
                  conditional structures as described in any of the mentioned patterns.

Start analyze function: MILADYXP.swapBack()
Function Security Analysis for MILADYXP.swapBack()
    The modifier of function swapBack are ['lockTheSwap']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier lockTheSwap is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: Upon review, the modifier lockTheSwap does indeed use a flag (inSwapAndLiquify) by setting it to true at the start and false at the end, ensuring the
          function is entered only once. Both lock (setting true) and unlock (setting false) operations are present, which aligns with rule 2.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
