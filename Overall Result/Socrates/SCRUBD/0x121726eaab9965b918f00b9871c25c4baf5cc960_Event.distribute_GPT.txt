Function Security Analysis for Event.distribute()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function distribute.
    Check direct function security
        - function Event.distribute() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The provided code does not include any require, if, or assert statements referencing msg.sender with a comparison to xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO or
          involving restrictions based on msg.sender. The checks focus on time (block.timestamp) and distribution conditions (totalClaps) which do not involve sender-
          specific conditions.
        - function Event.distribute() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures such as requiring a boolean to be true and then setting it to false, or vice versa. It
          primarily performs actions based on conditions related to time and a total claps variable, and involves transferring rewards to attendees.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['attendees[i].call.value(reward)()']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - attendees[i].call.value(reward)() ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['attendees[i].call.value(reward)()']
    Analyze External Address
        The variable 'i' in external call 'attendees[i].call.value(reward)()' has no state variable assigned. Therefore we check whether it has been hardcoded in the
        function.
            No The variable 'i' is used as a loop index initialized to 0 and is incremented by 1 in each iteration. It is not hardcoded to a specific value; instead, it
            serves to iterate over the length of the 'attendees' array.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
