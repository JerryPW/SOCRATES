    Check direct function security
        - function Crowdsale.safeWithdrawal() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function `safeWithdrawal` checks if `msg.sender` is equal to a local variable `beneficiary` rather than a structural variable like
          xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
        - function Crowdsale.safeWithdrawal() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures, such as require(xxx == True); xxx = False; or require(!xxx); xxx = True; etc.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['beneficiary.send(amountRaised)', 'tokenReward.transfer(buyerId,amount)', 'tokenReward.balanceOf(address(this))']
    Analyze Transfer
        - beneficiary.send(amountRaised) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        'beneficiary.send(amountRaised)' contains the keyword '.send('. Thus, it satisfies the condition.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - tokenReward.transfer(buyerId,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - tokenReward.transfer(buyerId,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - tokenReward.balanceOf(address(this)) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['tokenReward.transfer(buyerId,amount)', 'tokenReward.balanceOf(address(this))']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['tokenReward'] should be checked in variable tokenReward
        Checked variables: tokenReward
            Yes The provided code is a constructor, as the function is explicitly named 'constructor'.
        There are ['tokenReward'] should be checked in variable tokenReward
        Checked variables: tokenReward
            Yes The provided code is a constructor with the name 'constructor'. Constructors satisfy the first characteristic as they are explicitly named 'constructor'.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
