    Check direct function security
        - function PoCGame.donateToWhale(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The provided function does not check for specific 'msg.sender' roles such as xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO through any of the listed structures.
        - function PoCGame.donateToWhale(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any 'require', 'if', or '!xxx' statements as specified in the given structures. It directly makes a call to a function and
          performs some operations.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

            Check direct function security
                - function PoCGame.donate() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function 'donate' does not contain any of the specified structures that involve msg.sender and access restrictions or checks based on
