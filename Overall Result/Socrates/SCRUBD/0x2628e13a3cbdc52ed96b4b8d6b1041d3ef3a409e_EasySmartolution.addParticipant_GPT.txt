Function Security Analysis for EasySmartolution.addParticipant(address,address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function addParticipant.
    Check direct function security
        - function EasySmartolution.addParticipant(address,address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function  addParticipant does not contain any checks specifically involving msg.sender being compared to xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO or related
          logic structures as per the criteria provided.
        - function EasySmartolution.addParticipant(address,address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The examined code snippet does not contain any of the specified structures. It uses 'require' statements that check conditions but not in the specified
          logical sequences or variable assignments. The variables 'xxx' are not present in the required form as both assignment and logical checks.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['processing.send(msg.value/20)', '_referrer.send(msg.value/20)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - processing.send(msg.value/20) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the
        '.send(' keyword, which satisfies the characteristic outlined in instruction 2.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - _referrer.send(msg.value/20) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the '.send('
        keyword, which satisfies the characteristic outlined in instruction 2.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: EasySmartolution.processPayment(address)
Function Security Analysis for EasySmartolution.processPayment(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function processPayment.
    Check direct function security
        - function EasySmartolution.processPayment(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified conditions related to checking 'msg.sender'.
        - function EasySmartolution.processPayment(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified patterns, such as checking a condition with 'require' or 'if' for a variable and then explicitly
          modifying that variable in the structure described.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['participant.processPayment.value(participant.daily())()']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - participant.processPayment.value(participant.daily())() ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['participant.processPayment.value(participant.daily())()']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['participants'] should be checked in variable participant
        Checked variables: participants
            No There is no constructor function in the provided code as there is no function whose name matches the contract name 'EasySmartolution', nor is there any
            function explicitly named 'constructor'. Additionally, the code uses the 'participants' state variable by retrieving values from it and storing new values
            into it based on variable inputs, not any hardcoded values, which means the second characteristic does not apply.
            Function Security Analysis for EasySmartolution.addParticipant(address,address)
                There are no modifiers should be examined in function addParticipant.
                Check direct function security
                    - function EasySmartolution.addParticipant(address,address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                      Reason: The function 'addParticipant' does not include any of the specified structures related to restrictions on 'msg.sender'. There is no
                      'require', 'if', or 'assert' statement checking 'msg.sender' against any owner, address, leader, or CEO. The function requirements are about
                      particular conditions on '_address', 'msg.value' and involve participant addition and payment processing.
                    - function EasySmartolution.addParticipant(address,address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                      Reason: The code does not contain any 'require' or 'if' statements with the specified structures related to a boolean variable being checked and
                      then negated or changed. The 'require' statements check for address comparators and value boundaries, but they do not fit the specified pattern for
                      boolean changes from true/false to its opposite.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
