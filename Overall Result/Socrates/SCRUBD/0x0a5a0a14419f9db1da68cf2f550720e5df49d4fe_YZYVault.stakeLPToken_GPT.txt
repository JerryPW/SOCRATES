Function Security Analysis for YZYVault.stakeLPToken(uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function stakeLPToken.
    Check direct function security
        - function YZYVault.stakeLPToken(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any instance of `msg.sender` being checked directly against variables like `xxxOwner`, `xxxAddress`, `Leader`, or `CEO`. The
          `require`, `if` statements, and `assert` do not involve any comparison of `msg.sender` with such variables or roles in attributes.
        - function YZYVault.stakeLPToken(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon re-evaluation, the function contains the statement `require(!isContract(_msgSender()), ...);` but it does not contain any subsequent statements
          that assign a new value to the variable `isContract`. Hence, there is no full match to the specified structures, which require both the `require` and assignment
          statements to be present for the same variable.

        Checked variables: _yzyETHV2Pair
            No The function 'changeYzyETHPair' is not a constructor as the function name does not match the contract name 'YZYVault', nor is it explicitly named
            'constructor'. The function directly changes the state variable '_yzyETHV2Pair' based on the input parameter 'yzyETHPair', rather than using a hardcoded value
            within the function body. Hence, neither of the characteristics are satisfied.
            Function Security Analysis for YZYVault.changeYzyETHPair(address)
                The modifier of function changeYzyETHPair are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: Reevaluation confirms that the modifier uses 'require(_owner == _msgSender())' to ensure that only the owner can execute the function, which
                      matches characteristic 1. No structural omissions were found as this requires statement fulfills the condition for characteristic 1.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

    Check direct function security
        - function YZYVault.claimSwapReward() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function doesn't contain any checks using msg.sender related to ownership, specific address roles (Owner/Address/Leader/CEO), or assert/require
          statements enforcing such conditions.
        - function YZYVault.claimSwapReward() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not have any of the required structures such as if (condition) throw, require(condition), or any assignment to xxx variable after one of
          these checks.

        There are ['_yzy'] should be checked in variable _yzy
        Checked variables: _yzy
            No The function 'changeYzyAddress' is not a constructor since its name does not match the contract name 'YZYVault' and it is not explicitly named
            'constructor'. Additionally, the function does not hardcode the state variable '_yzy'; instead, it assigns the state variable based on the input parameter
            'yzy'. Therefore, the function does not satisfy any of the provided characteristics.
            Function Security Analysis for YZYVault.changeYzyAddress(address)

                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The code contains a structure checking whether the caller is the owner by using 'require(_owner == _msgSender(), "Ownable: caller is not the
                      owner")', satisfying rule 1 by enforcing ownership authorization. There are no structural omissions regarding this rule.

        - function YZYVault._sendLotteryAmount() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not have any of the specified code structures that involve checking the sender's address or role against an owner, address, leader, or
          CEO.
        - function YZYVault._sendLotteryAmount() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon re-evaluation, the code contains the statement 'if (!_enabledLottery || _lotteryAmount <= 0) return false;'. However, it does not include a
          subsequent assignment 'xxx = true;' or 'xxx = True;' that would satisfy any of the given structures. All the specified structures require both a conditional
          check and an assignment, which are not fully met in this code.

                - function YZYVault.claimYzyAvailableReward() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The provided function does not have any of the specified structures related to checking the sender against a specific owner, address, or role
                  like Owner/Leader/CEO. It mainly focuses on verifying reward availability and transferring tokens.
                - function YZYVault.claimYzyAvailableReward() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the exact structures as described. It only uses require statements to check conditions, but they do not
                  explicitly match the structures prefixed with a variable assignment as given.

                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The modifier 'onlyOwner' uses 'require(_owner == _msgSender())', which matches the first characteristic, ensuring only the owner can execute
                      the function. There is no mention of a lock operation for characteristic two. Therefore, the judgment of 'Yes' based on characteristic one is
                      correct.

                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The modifier onlyOwner enforces that only the owner can execute the function by using the require statement to check if the caller
                      (_msgSender()) is the owner (_owner). This satisfies the first characteristic as mentioned in the instruction. There are no structural omissions
                      related to the lock operation as it is not applicable in this context.
            There are ['_weth'] should be checked in variable _weth
            Checked variables: _weth
                Yes The code provided is a constructor for the contract named 'YZYVault'. The function is explicitly named 'constructor', which matches one of the
                characteristics to satisfy the condition. The constructor initializes several state variables, one of which is '_weth', but it is not hardcoded; instead,
                it is initialized using a parameter 'weth'. The presence of the 'constructor' keyword confirms it is a constructor.
            There are ['_weth'] should be checked in variable _weth
            Checked variables: _weth
                Yes The code provided is clearly a constructor for the contract. This can be identified because the function is named 'constructor', which satisfies the
                rule for judging it as a constructor function. The state variable '_weth' is not hardcoded but is passed as a parameter to the constructor. Hence, this
                satisfies the first characteristic, and the answer is 'Yes'.
        There are ['_uniswapV2Router'] should be checked in variable _uniswapV2Router
        Checked variables: _uniswapV2Router
            Yes 1. The function is a constructor as indicated by its name being 'constructor'. This matches the characteristic of being a contract constructor.  2. The
            state variable `_uniswapV2Router` is hardcoded with the address `0x7a250d5630B4cF539739dF2C5dAcb4c659F2488D` within the constructor.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
