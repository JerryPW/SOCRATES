Function Security Analysis for BrokerV2.bid(uint256,address,uint256)
    The modifier of function bid are ['onSaleOnly', 'activeAuction']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier onSaleOnly has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier checks whether a token is open for sale but does not enforce owner or specific address restrictions nor does it implement a lock operation.
          It purely checks a state variable related to sales.
        - modifier activeAuction has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier 'activeAuction' does not enforce owner-only execution, use lock operations, or have a name suggesting such restrictions like Onlyxxx or
          nonReentrant. It only checks if the auction time is still active.
    Check direct function security
        - function BrokerV2.bid(uint256,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any conditions checking msg.sender against an owner or similar designation, like xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, CEO, nor
          does it use any of the specified assertion or exception patterns relevant to msg.sender.
        - function BrokerV2.bid(uint256,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures where a variable is set to true or false with the given conditions. The operations like
          comparisions with true (if(_auction.buyer == true) or false are not followed by similar variable reset or throw statements.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['erc20Token.transfer(_auction.highestBidder,_auction.currentBid)', 'erc20Token.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),amount)',
    '_auction.highestBidder.transfer(_auction.currentBid)', 'Token.safeTransferFrom(Token.ownerOf(tokenID),address(this),tokenID)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - erc20Token.transfer(_auction.highestBidder,_auction.currentBid) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - _auction.highestBidder.transfer(_auction.currentBid) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external
        call contains '.transfer(' keyword: '_auction.highestBidder.transfer(_auction.currentBid)'.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - erc20Token.transfer(_auction.highestBidder,_auction.currentBid) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - erc20Token.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - Token.safeTransferFrom(Token.ownerOf(tokenID),address(this),tokenID) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['erc20Token.transfer(_auction.highestBidder,_auction.currentBid)', 'erc20Token.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),amount)',
    'Token.safeTransferFrom(Token.ownerOf(tokenID),address(this),tokenID)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['auctions'] should be checked in variable erc20Token
        Checked variables: auctions
            No The provided code contains several functions, but none of them are constructors. The function names include 'bid', 'collect', 'buy', 'putOnSale',
            'updatePrice', and 'putSaleOff', none of which match the contract name 'BrokerV2' or are named 'constructor'. Furthermore, although the state variable
            'auctions' is used several times throughout the code, it is not hardcoded in any of the functions. The state variable 'auctions' is being accessed with
            dynamic keys (inputs) which are function parameters like '_mintableToken' and 'tokenID'. Therefore, none of the functions satisfy the conditions given in the
            task to output 'Yes'.
            Function Security Analysis for BrokerV2.bid(uint256,address,uint256)
                The modifier of function bid are ['onSaleOnly', 'activeAuction']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onSaleOnly has no relation with controlled by owner.
                      Reason: The code in the modifier does not enforce any ownership or specific address execution restriction. It checks if a token is open for sale,
                      which is not related to access control by sender address, nor does it use locking techniques. Moreover, the modifier's name 'onSaleOnly' doesn't
                      imply access control by specific addresses or locking operation.
                    - modifier activeAuction has no relation with controlled by owner.
                      Reason: The modifier checks if block.timestamp is less than the auction's closingTime, but it doesn't enforce owner-only execution, nor does it use
                      a lock operation. It also doesn't have an indicative name suggesting restricted access or non-reentrancy.
                Check direct function security
                    - function BrokerV2.bid(uint256,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                      Reason: The code does not have any guard checks that specifically require, assert, or conditionally handle `msg.sender` in comparison to an owner,
                      address, leader, or CEO role. It only checks `msg.sender` in the context of standard validations such as allowance and payable checks, which do not
                      fall under the provided conditions.
                    - function BrokerV2.bid(uint256,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                      Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures involving a variable and its state changes as per the given conditions.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
