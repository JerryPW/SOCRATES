Function Security Analysis for BrokerV2.buy(uint256,address)
    The modifier of function buy are ['onSaleOnly', 'flatSaleOnly']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier onSaleOnly has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier provided does not contain any checks for ownership, specific address enforcement, or lock operations based on the code provided. It only
          checks if a token is open for sale based on a mapping. Thus, it does not satisfy any of the conditions specified for outputting 'Yes'.
        - modifier flatSaleOnly has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The provided modifier code does not satisfy any of the specified characteristics. There are no checks to restrict execution to the owner or specific
          addresses, nor is there any lock mechanism or indication of such protections based on the modifier's name.
    Check direct function security
        - function BrokerV2.buy(uint256,address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any statement like 'require(msg.sender == xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO);', 'if (msg.sender !=
          xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO) {...}', 'if (msg.sender != xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO) throw;', or 'assert(msg.sender == xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO);'.
          Hence, it does not meet any of the specified conditions.
        - function BrokerV2.buy(uint256,address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function does not have any 'require' statement that sets a condition on a boolean variable and then toggles its value as described in the
          structures. The variable 'tokenOpenForSale[_tokenDet.NFTAddress][_tokenDet.tokenID]' is set to false, but there is no preceding 'require' statement that matches
          any of the specified patterns.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['Token.safeTransferFrom(Token.ownerOf(_tokenDet.tokenID),msg.sender,_tokenDet.tokenID)',
    'erc20Token.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),brokerageAmount)', 'erc20Token.transferFrom(msg.sender,lastOwner2,lastOwner_funds)', 'creator.transfer(royality)',
    'lastOwner2.transfer(lastOwner_funds)', 'erc20Token.transferFrom(msg.sender,creator,royality)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - creator.transfer(royality) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        'creator.transfer(royality)' contains '.transfer('. Thus, it satisfies the mentioned characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - lastOwner2.transfer(lastOwner_funds) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        'lastOwner2.transfer(lastOwner_funds)' contains '.transfer('. Thus, it satisfies the mentioned characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - Token.safeTransferFrom(Token.ownerOf(_tokenDet.tokenID),msg.sender,_tokenDet.tokenID) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - erc20Token.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),brokerageAmount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - erc20Token.transferFrom(msg.sender,lastOwner2,lastOwner_funds) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - erc20Token.transferFrom(msg.sender,creator,royality) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['Token.safeTransferFrom(Token.ownerOf(_tokenDet.tokenID),msg.sender,_tokenDet.tokenID)',
    'erc20Token.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),brokerageAmount)', 'erc20Token.transferFrom(msg.sender,lastOwner2,lastOwner_funds)',
    'erc20Token.transferFrom(msg.sender,creator,royality)']
    Analyze External Address
        The variable 'Token' in external call 'Token.safeTransferFrom(Token.ownerOf(_tokenDet.tokenID),msg.sender,_tokenDet.tokenID)' has no state variable assigned.
        Therefore we check whether it has been hardcoded in the function.
            No The provided function `buy` utilizes the variable `tokenID` as a parameter in its logic. This parameter is required to invoke the function and is
            interacted with throughout the function's execution. The value of `tokenID` is based on what is passed when the function is called, rather than being
            determined or set to a fixed value inside the function itself. This indicates that `tokenID` is dynamic and not hardcoded within the function, meaning its
            value is not predetermined by a constant or static content inside the body of the function.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
