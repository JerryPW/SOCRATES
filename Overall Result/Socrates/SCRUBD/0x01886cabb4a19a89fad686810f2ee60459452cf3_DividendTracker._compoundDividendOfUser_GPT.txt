    Check direct function security
        - function DividendTracker._compoundDividendOfUser(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The given function `_compoundDividendOfUser` does not contain any of the specified structures that perform checks on `msg.sender`. The function works
          with an `account` parameter and performs various operations related to dividends and token swapping without explicit conditions or requirements involving
          `msg.sender`.
        - function DividendTracker._compoundDividendOfUser(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any `require(xxx == True); xxx = False;`, `require(xxx == False); xxx = True;`, `require(!xxx); xxx = True;`, or `if(!xxx)
          throw; xxx = true;` structure. There is an if condition with `!success`, but no throw statement and no variable setting pattern described in the initial check.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['compoundAccount']
        Function Security Analysis for DividendTracker.compoundAccount(address)
            The modifier of function compoundAccount are ['onlyOwner']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The code has a 'require' statement that ensures only the owner can execute the function: 'require(owner() == _msgSender())'. This matches
                  criterion 1, which specifies that ownership checks should be enforced using a 'require' statement. There are no lock/unlock operations in this modifier,
                  so criterion 2 does not apply.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
