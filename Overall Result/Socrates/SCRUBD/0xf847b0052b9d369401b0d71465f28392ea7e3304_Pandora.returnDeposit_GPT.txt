Function Security Analysis for Pandora.returnDeposit()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function returnDeposit.
    Check direct function security
        - function Pandora.returnDeposit() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not include any statements that directly compare msg.sender to an owner, address, Leader, or CEO. It only uses msg.sender as a key to
          retrieve and update data from a mapping.
        - function Pandora.returnDeposit() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not match any of the predefined structures as it does not contain any 'require' statement or '!xxx' condition followed by 'throw'.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['fallback']
        Function Security Analysis for Pandora.fallback()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
            Check direct function security
                - function Pandora.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures that check the identity of 'msg.sender' against 'xxxOwner', 'xxxAddress', 'Leader', or
                  'CEO'. The function checks the value of 'msg.value' and invokes different functions accordingly, but does not restrict operations based on the sender's
                  identity in the specified manner.
                - function Pandora.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not include any of the specified patterns with 'require' or 'if (!xxx) throw' combined with setting the variable to true or false
                  as per the given structures.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['msg.sender.transfer(getPay)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - msg.sender.transfer(getPay) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the
        '.transfer(' keyword, indicating it satisfies the specified characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
