Start analyze function: EbyteDistribution.fallback()
Function Security Analysis for EbyteDistribution.fallback()
    The modifier of function fallback are ['onlyWhitelist', 'isUnlocked']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier onlyWhitelist has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier only checks if msg.sender is not in a blacklist. It does not check for a specific owner or address (Rule 1) nor does it refer to any
          locking mechanism (Rule 2). The function name 'onlyWhitelist' does not inherently suggest ownership or reentrancy protection without additional context (Rule
          3).
        - modifier isUnlocked has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: Upon re-evaluating the modifier 'isUnlocked', it uses 'require(!contractLocked);', which indeed only checks if the contract is not locked before
          proceeding with the function. However, there is no evidence of resetting or setting this flag within this modifier to ensure it enters only once, hence it does
          not fully implement both lock and unlock operations required for a lock operation mechanism. Therefore, this does not satisfy the conditions for characteristic
          2.
    Check direct function security
        - function EbyteDistribution.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures where msg.sender is checked for equivalence or inequality with an identifier like
          xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
        - function EbyteDistribution.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code snippet does not contain any of the specified structures. It lacks 'require(xxx == True/False)' or 'if(!xxx) throw', as well as the
          subsequent assignment of 'xxx = False/True'.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['ebyteToken.transfer(investor,toGiveT)', 'ebyteToken.transfer(investor,toGiveE)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - ebyteToken.transfer(investor,toGiveT) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - ebyteToken.transfer(investor,toGiveE) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - ebyteToken.transfer(investor,toGiveT) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - ebyteToken.transfer(investor,toGiveE) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['ebyteToken.transfer(investor,toGiveT)', 'ebyteToken.transfer(investor,toGiveE)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['ebyteToken'] should be checked in variable ebyteToken
        Checked variables: ebyteToken
            Yes The provided function is named 'EbyteDistribution', which matches the contract name, indicating that it is a constructor. Therefore, it satisfies the
            first characteristic.
        There are ['ebyteToken'] should be checked in variable ebyteToken
        Checked variables: ebyteToken
            Yes The provided function is named 'EbyteDistribution', which matches the contract name 'EbyteDistribution'. This indicates that the function is a constructor
            based on its name matching the contract name.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: EbyteDistribution.getTokenBalance(address)
Function Security Analysis for EbyteDistribution.getTokenBalance(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function getTokenBalance.
    Check direct function security
        - function EbyteDistribution.getTokenBalance(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures related to checking or asserting the identity of msg.sender against a specific owner or leader
          address.
        - function EbyteDistribution.getTokenBalance(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code snippet does not contain any 'require' or 'if' statements nor any assignment to a boolean variable, which are necessary components for the
          structures specified in the criteria.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['ebyteToken.balanceOf(who)']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - ebyteToken.balanceOf(who) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['ebyteToken.balanceOf(who)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['ebyteToken'] should be checked in variable ebyteToken
        Checked variables: ebyteToken
            Yes The function name 'EbyteDistribution' matches the contract name 'EbyteDistribution', indicating that this function is a constructor. Constructors do not
            satisfy the characteristic of having hardcoded state variables as they are used for initializing state variables.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
