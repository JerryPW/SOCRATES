          statement. In structure 4, both 'if(!xxx) throw;' and 'xxx = true;' must be found, but only the multiple 'if' statements are present in this context, not
          followed by the second required part of setting 'xxx = true;'. Therefore, it does not match completely with any of the specified structures.
