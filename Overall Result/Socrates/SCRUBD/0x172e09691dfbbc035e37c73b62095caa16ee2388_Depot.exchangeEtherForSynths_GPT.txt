Function Security Analysis for Depot.exchangeEtherForSynths()
    The modifier of function exchangeEtherForSynths are ['pricesNotStale', 'notPaused']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier pricesNotStale has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier 'pricesNotStale' does not explicitly enforce owner-only execution nor use a lock mechanism, and does not indicate these via its name either
          according to the provided conditions.
        - modifier notPaused has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier checks if the contract is paused, not owner or specific address validation, nor does it handle reentrancy.
    Check direct function security
        - function Depot.exchangeEtherForSynths() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function `exchangeEtherForSynths` does not contain any of the specified structures involving `msg.sender` checking against owner, address, leader,
          or CEO variables that are explicitly required or asserted.  It doesn't have a require(msg.sender == xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO);, if (msg.sender !=
          xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO) {...}, if (msg.sender != xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO) throw;, or assert(msg.sender == xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO);
          statement matching the given patterns.
        - function Depot.exchangeEtherForSynths() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any require statement or if statement that meets any of the specified structures. The structures require a specific pattern
          such as a requirement on a boolean variable followed by an assignment to that variable, but no such pattern is present in the code.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['fundsWallet.transfer(ethToSend)', 'deposit.user.send(ethToSend)', 'synth.transfer(msg.sender,remainingToFulfill)',
    'msg.sender.transfer(remainingToFulfill.divideDecimal(usdToEthPrice))', 'synth.transfer(msg.sender,deposit.amount)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - fundsWallet.transfer(ethToSend) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: This external call contains the
        '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - deposit.user.send(ethToSend) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: This external call contains the
        '.send(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - synth.transfer(msg.sender,remainingToFulfill) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - msg.sender.transfer(remainingToFulfill.divideDecimal(usdToEthPrice)) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason:
        This external call contains the '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - synth.transfer(msg.sender,deposit.amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - synth.transfer(msg.sender,remainingToFulfill) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - synth.transfer(msg.sender,deposit.amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['synth.transfer(msg.sender,remainingToFulfill)', 'synth.transfer(msg.sender,deposit.amount)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['synth'] should be checked in variable synth
        Checked variables: synth
            Yes The code provided includes a constructor for the "Depot" contract as the function is explicitly named 'constructor'. The given external function
            'setSynth' sets the state variable 'synth', but it does not hardcode it as it accepts an input to update its value. Therefore, the construction of the smart
            contract is the reason it satisfies one of the characteristics.
        There are ['synth'] should be checked in variable synth
        Checked variables: synth
            Yes The contract contains a constructor function that matches characteristic 1, as it is explicitly named 'constructor'.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
