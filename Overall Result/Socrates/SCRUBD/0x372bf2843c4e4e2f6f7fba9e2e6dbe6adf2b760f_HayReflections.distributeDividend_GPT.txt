Function Security Analysis for HayReflections.distributeDividend(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function distributeDividend.
    Check direct function security
        - function HayReflections.distributeDividend(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not have any checks or asserts for msg.sender related to specific roles like xxxOwner or xxxAddress. It primarily operates on the
          shareholder's data, distributing dividends if conditions are met, without any restrictions or checks based on the caller's address.
        - function HayReflections.distributeDividend(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code checks if 'shares[shareholder].amount' is 0 and returns if true. It does not modify this variable to switch between true and false as per the
          provided structure requirements. Instead, it performs operations related to dividend distribution without changing the truth value of the checked condition,
          which is different from the required structures in the prompt.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['gibTokens', 'process', 'setShare']
        Function Security Analysis for HayReflections.gibTokens(address)
            The modifier of function gibTokens are ['onlyToken']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyToken is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: Rule 1 applies because the code uses 'require(msg.sender == _token)' to enforce that only the address stored in _token can execute the function.
                  The entire structure aligns with the requirement.
        Function Security Analysis for HayReflections.process(uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function process.
            Check direct function security
                - function HayReflections.process(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain any require, if, or assert statement checking if msg.sender equals or does not equal xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
                - function HayReflections.process(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures, such as requiring a boolean variable to hold a specific value and then changing its
                  value, or a throw statement based on a boolean variable's value and then changing that boolean's state.

        - IERC20(HAY).transfer(shareholder,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - IERC20(HAY).transfer(shareholder,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['IERC20(HAY).transfer(shareholder,amount)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['HAY'] should be checked in variable HAY
        Checked variables: HAY
            Yes The provided code is a constructor, and within this constructor, the state variable 'HAY' is hardcoded with the address
            '0xfA3E941D1F6B7b10eD84A0C211bfA8aeE907965e'. Since the function is explicitly named 'constructor', it satisfies the first characteristic, and by hardcoding
            the 'HAY' variable, it also satisfies the second characteristic.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
