Start analyze function: Crowdsale.buyTokens(address)
Function Security Analysis for Crowdsale.buyTokens(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function buyTokens.
    Check direct function security
        - function Crowdsale.buyTokens(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not have any statements involving role verification against 'msg.sender', such as 'require(msg.sender == xxxOwner)' or 'if (msg.sender !=
          xxxOwner)'. It is only checking the validity of the purchase and beneficiary.
        - function Crowdsale.buyTokens(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code checks if the 'beneficiary' is not the zero address using the statement `require(beneficiary != address(0));`. However, there are no
          structures that match the specified conditions, particularly changing a boolean variable's state based on a requirement or condition.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['token.transfer(beneficiary,tokens)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - token.transfer(beneficiary,tokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - token.transfer(beneficiary,tokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['token.transfer(beneficiary,tokens)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            Yes The function provided matches the contract name, 'Crowdsale', indicating it is a constructor. Additionally, the state variable 'token' is assigned a
            hardcoded address within the function ('0x6A09e1b7cC5cb52FfdfC585a8dF51CED7063915C'). Thus, it satisfies both characteristics.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: Crowdsale.forwardFunds()
Function Security Analysis for Crowdsale.forwardFunds()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function forwardFunds.
    Check direct function security
        - function Crowdsale.forwardFunds() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The provided code does not have any checks or constraints related to `msg.sender`. It merely forwards funds to a wallet.
        - function Crowdsale.forwardFunds() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not have any require statements, variable assignments, or if conditions with a throw. It consists solely of a function that calls
          a transfer method.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['fallback', 'buyTokens']
        Function Security Analysis for Crowdsale.fallback()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
            Check direct function security
                - function Crowdsale.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not include any require, if, or assert statements that check msg.sender against xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
                - function Crowdsale.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided function does not contain any 'require' or 'if' statements as described in the specified structures.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['wallet.transfer(msg.value)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - wallet.transfer(msg.value) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains '.transfer(',
        so it satisfies the characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
