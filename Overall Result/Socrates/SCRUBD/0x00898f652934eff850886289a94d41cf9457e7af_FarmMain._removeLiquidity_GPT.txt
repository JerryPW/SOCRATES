Function Security Analysis for FarmMain._removeLiquidity(uint256,uint256,bool,uint256,bool)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _removeLiquidity.
    Check direct function security
        - function FarmMain._removeLiquidity(uint256,uint256,bool,uint256,bool) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not have any conditions or assertions checking if `msg.sender` is equal or not equal to a specific address such as xxxOwner, xxxAddress,
          Leader, CEO, or similar within its control structures or assertions.
        - function FarmMain._removeLiquidity(uint256,uint256,bool,uint256,bool) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon re-evaluation of the given code, none of the specified structures are fully satisfied. Although there is the segment 'if (!setupInfo.free &&
          _setups[setupIndex].active && !isUnlock) { _toggleSetup(setupIndex); }', it does not fully correspond to any of the specified structures as it does not involve
          setting the same variable to true or false as required in the conditions.  For instance, none of these chunks involve explicitly requiring or ensuring 'xxx' to
          be False or True, followed by setting 'xxx' to the opposite Boolean. In the existing code, it checks conditions but does not directly set 'xxx' as required by
          the given structures.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['unlock', 'withdrawLiquidity']
        Function Security Analysis for FarmMain.unlock(uint256,bool)
            The modifier of function unlock are ['byPositionOwner']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier byPositionOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: Upon reviewing the code, it includes `require(_positions[positionId].uniqueOwner == msg.sender...)`, which checks if the `msg.sender` is the
                  owner of the position, thus satisfying rule 1.
        Function Security Analysis for FarmMain.withdrawLiquidity(uint256,uint256,bool,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function withdrawLiquidity.
            Check direct function security
                - function FarmMain.withdrawLiquidity(uint256,uint256,bool,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function only checks msg.sender against farmingPosition.uniqueOwner, which is a local variable, and this does not match any of the required
                  structures involving direct checks against specific roles like xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO.
                - function FarmMain.withdrawLiquidity(uint256,uint256,bool,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code does not fit any of the specified structures involving manipulation of the same variable alongside require statements. There
                  are require statements present, but they do not reset the same variable before and after the checking condition as described in the provided templates.

            No 1. The functions provided do not have names matching the contract name 'FarmMain', nor are they explicitly designated as 'constructor', indicating that
            neither function is a constructor.   2. There is no hardcoded use of the state variable '_setupsInfo' in the provided function code. The variable appears in
            indexed operations and assignments but without any hardcoded values that could be altered.
            Function Security Analysis for FarmMain._setOrAddFarmingSetupInfo(FarmingSetupInfo,bool,bool,uint256)
                There are no modifiers should be examined in function _setOrAddFarmingSetupInfo.
                Check direct function security
                    - function FarmMain._setOrAddFarmingSetupInfo(FarmingSetupInfo,bool,bool,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of
                    msg.sender
                      Reason: The code does not have any of the specified structures where it checks `msg.sender` against a specific owner, address, leader, or CEO role
                      in the require or if statements.
                    - function FarmMain._setOrAddFarmingSetupInfo(FarmingSetupInfo,bool,bool,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                      Reason: In the provided code, the only relevant conditional statement involving a 'require' is:  `require(setup.active, "Not possible");`  However,
                      this does not match the pattern `require(xxx == True); xxx = False;` or the other specified patterns. It only checks if 'setup.active' is true,
                      resulting in an exception if not. No corresponding 'setup.active = false;' statement exists in the scope as required by the pattern.
                Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
                The reachable functions are ['init', 'setFarmingSetups']
                    Function Security Analysis for FarmMain.init(address,bytes,address,address,bytes)
                        There are no modifiers should be examined in function init.
                        Check direct function security
                            - function FarmMain.init(address,bytes,address,address,bytes) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                              Reason: The function code does not include any of the characteristics or structures defined in the condition, such as checks on msg.sender
                              against a specific owner, address, leader, or CEO.
                            - function FarmMain.init(address,bytes,address,address,bytes) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                              Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures. It contains 'require' statements and a variety of functional operations
                              but none matching the conditions outlined.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
