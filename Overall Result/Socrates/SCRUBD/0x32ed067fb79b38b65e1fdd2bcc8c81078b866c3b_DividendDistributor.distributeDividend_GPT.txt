Function Security Analysis for DividendDistributor.distributeDividend(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function distributeDividend.
    Check direct function security
        - function DividendDistributor.distributeDividend(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not check or compare `msg.sender` to any owner or specific address, nor uses the assert function for sender verification, thus doesn't
          match any of the specified structures.
        - function DividendDistributor.distributeDividend(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code checks if 'shares[shareholder].amount == 0' and returns if true, but it does not revert or throw an error. Moreover, it does not modify the
          value of 'shares[shareholder].amount' post the check, nor does it rely on the require or throw mechanism to enforce logic. Therefore, the code does not match
          any specified pattern.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['process', 'claimDividend', 'setShare']
        Function Security Analysis for DividendDistributor.process(uint256)
            The modifier of function process are ['onlyToken']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyToken is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The code structure is "require(msg.sender == _token);" which falls under rule 1 where only a specific address (_token) can execute the function.
                  There's no evidence of structural omissions or presence of a lock/unlock mechanism for rule 2.
        Function Security Analysis for DividendDistributor.claimDividend()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function claimDividend.
            Check direct function security
                - function DividendDistributor.claimDividend() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain any checks on msg.sender against xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
                - function DividendDistributor.claimDividend() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code provided for the function does not contain any of the specified structures involving a conditional require statement or a conditional
                  throw followed by setting a boolean variable as described in the characteristics. It simply calls another function, distributeDividend, with msg.sender
                  as an argument.

    Analyze Gas
        - BITCOIN.transfer(shareholder,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['BITCOIN.transfer(shareholder,amount)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['BITCOIN'] should be checked in variable BITCOIN
        Checked variables: BITCOIN
            State variable BITCOIN has initialized in public area after declaration.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
