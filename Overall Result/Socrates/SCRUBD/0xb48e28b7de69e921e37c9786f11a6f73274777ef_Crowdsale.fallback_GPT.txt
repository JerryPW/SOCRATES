Function Security Analysis for Crowdsale.fallback()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
    Check direct function security
        - function Crowdsale.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specific structures that check or assert the identity of the msg.sender against an owner, address, or
          leader. It only has a require statement checking a boolean condition (!crowdsaleClosed), but nothing involving msg.sender in the specified ways.
        - function Crowdsale.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon re-evaluation of the code, it becomes apparent that only the statement `require(!crowdsaleClosed);` is present. There is no subsequent statement in
          the function that sets `crowdsaleClosed` to either `True` or `False`, which is a necessary part of the defined structures to yield a 'Yes' judgment. As a
          result, the function does not completely match any of the specified structures because the assignment to `True` or `False` is not found. Therefore, the initial
          judgment should be corrected to 'No'.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,amount/price)', 'beneficiary.send(amountRaised)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,amount/price) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - beneficiary.send(amountRaised) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the
        '.send(' keyword indicating that it satisfies the second characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,amount/price) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,amount/price)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['tokenReward'] should be checked in variable tokenReward
        Checked variables: tokenReward
            Yes 1. The provided code is a constructor of the 'Crowdsale' contract since the function name matches the contract name 'Crowdsale'. Therefore, it satisfies
            the first characteristic. 2. The state variable 'tokenReward' in the function code is not hardcoded but instead assigned using a parameter. Therefore, it does
            not satisfy the second characteristic.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
