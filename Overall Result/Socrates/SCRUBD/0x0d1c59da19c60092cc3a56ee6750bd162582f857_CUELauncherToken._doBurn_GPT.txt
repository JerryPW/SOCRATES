    Check direct function security
        - function CUELauncherToken._doBurn(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code snippet does not contain any checks or conditions related to 'msg.sender == xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO' or equivalent logical expressions.
        - function CUELauncherToken._doBurn(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any require() statements or if() conditions that throw an error based on a condition, nor any Boolean state changes
          corresponding to the specified patterns.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

                - function CUELauncherToken._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The provided code does not contain any expressions that check if the `msg.sender` is equal to or not equal to an owner or specific address role
                  like xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO. It primarily enforces checks and conditions on sender and recipient addresses for transfer limits and tax
                  logic without involving owner or specific address role checks.
                - function CUELauncherToken._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The given function does not include any of the specified patterns. All 'require' statements in the code verify conditions without immediately
                  changing the values of the variables involved in these conditions.
            Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

                        - function CUELauncherToken.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                          Reason: No condition involves checking if msg.sender is or isn't equal to xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
                        - function CUELauncherToken.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                          Reason: The code provided does not contain any of the required patterns specified. There is no 'require' statement checking a boolean variable,
                          no manipulation of such a variable, and no logic throwing an exception based on the boolean variable as described in the patterns.

Function Security Analysis for CUELauncherToken._transfer(address,address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _transfer.
    Check direct function security
        - function CUELauncherToken._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The given code does not contain any direct checks on `msg.sender` in the context of authorization. It only enforces checks on `sender` and `recipient`
          parameters for various conditions, such as ensuring they are not the zero address or imposing transaction limits and taxations. Since `msg.sender` is not used
          in the context of checking against an owner or specific address for access control, it does not meet any of the specified structures.
        - function CUELauncherToken._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code checks some requirements but does not toggle Boolean variables between true and false with the specified structures. It primarily uses
          conditions, if-statements, and function calls without involving assignments of Boolean variables designed to switch states as required by the described
          patterns.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

                - function CUELauncherToken.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the structures mentioned. There's neither a require nor an if statement that checks a variable against true or
                  false conditions and then changing its value to the opposite within the function.

        - function CUELauncherToken._doMarketing(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any access control statements checking against msg.sender.
        - function CUELauncherToken._doMarketing(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code provided does not include any 'require' statements or any variable initialization and checks, thus it does not match any of the specified
          structures.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

                  Reason: The function does not contain any checks involving `msg.sender` such as those listed in the criteria above. It mainly checks conditions against
                  `sender` and `recipient` addresses, which are function parameters, not `msg.sender`.
                - function CUELauncherToken._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any structure mentioned in the prompt that uses require with variable assignment immediately before or after it as
