Function Security Analysis for DividendPayingToken._withdrawDividendOfUser(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _withdrawDividendOfUser.
    Check direct function security
        - function DividendPayingToken._withdrawDividendOfUser(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any use of msg.sender comparison with any ownership or authorized addresses, nor does it handle any permissions related to
          msg.sender. The logic focuses solely on handling dividend withdrawal.
        - function DividendPayingToken._withdrawDividendOfUser(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function checks for success with an 'if(!success)' block and manipulates the state of 'withdrawnDividends' based on the condition. However, it does
          not set 'success' to true, so it does not fully match any given structure.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['withdrawDividend']
        Function Security Analysis for DividendPayingToken.withdrawDividend()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function withdrawDividend.
            Check direct function security
                - function DividendPayingToken.withdrawDividend() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code snippet does not contain any condition that checks the sender against a specific owner or address like xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or
                  CEO.
                - function DividendPayingToken.withdrawDividend() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided function does not contain any of the required structures such as assignments of a boolean variable after a require statement, or an
                  if statement throwing an exception. It simply calls another function.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['user.call{gas:gasForTransfer,value:_withdrawableDividend}()']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - user.call{gas:gasForTransfer,value:_withdrawableDividend}() is subjected to gas limits gasForTransfer <= 3000. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here
        is the reason: The code provided shows a constructor function in a smart contract, which is part of an Ethereum solidity codebase. In the constructor, the
        variable `gasForTransfer` is directly assigned the value `3000`. There are no other operations or conditional logic altering this assignment within the snippet
        shown. Based on this snippet only, `gasForTransfer` is always initialized to and remains at 3000 when the contract is deployed, hence it is indeed less than or
        equal to 3000 as per the question.
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
