Function Security Analysis for DecentralizedExchangeHotPotato.revoke(uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function revoke.
    Check direct function security
        - function DecentralizedExchangeHotPotato.revoke(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: They are checking msg.sender against a local structure (orderBook[_id].owner) which does not fit the specified conditions as it is not globally set as
          xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO.
        - function DecentralizedExchangeHotPotato.revoke(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code doesn't satisfy any of the given conditions. The require statements do not check a boolean variable to then flip it or otherwise fit the
          specified patterns.

    Analyze Gas
        - issuer.transfer(msg.sender,orderBook[_id].tokenId) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['issuer.transfer(msg.sender,orderBook[_id].tokenId)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['orderBook'] should be checked in variable issuer
        Checked variables: orderBook
            No 1. The code provided does not include a constructor function. While the contract name is "DecentralizedExchangeHotPotato", there is no function named
            "DecentralizedExchangeHotPotato" or "constructor", which indicates there is no constructor present in the given code. 2. The state variable mentioned is
            "orderBook". In the provided code, the state variable "orderBook" is not hardcoded with a specific value. Instead, it is populated and manipulated
            dynamically, such as when creating new orders in the 'put' function or when updating orders in the 'buy' and 'revoke' functions. There are no explicit
            hardcoded values for "orderBook" in this context.
            Function Security Analysis for DecentralizedExchangeHotPotato.put(address,uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256)
                There are no modifiers should be examined in function put.
                Check direct function security
                    - function DecentralizedExchangeHotPotato.put(address,uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority
                    of msg.sender
                      Reason: The code checks whether the owner of a token is the same as the sender using `require(issuer.ownerOf(_tokenId) == msg.sender);`. This
                      satisfies the second criterion where it indirectly checks the sender against ownership held in another contract.
                    - function DecentralizedExchangeHotPotato.put(address,uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock
                    machinism.
                      Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures where a variable is checked for a boolean condition and then set to a boolean
                      value.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
