    Check direct function security
        - function Bussiness.buyByUsdt(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The provided code does not have any condition or requirement that directly checks msg.sender against xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO. It only has checks
          related to usdtPrices, erc721Address approvals, and usdtToken transfers.
        - function Bussiness.buyByUsdt(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code doesn't contain any of the specified structural patterns, such as requiring a boolean to be true or false and then setting it to the opposite
          value.  The code uses require statements for conditions related to price and approval, not specifically checking a boolean and then altering it. The variable
          manipulations are related to transferring tokens and resetting prices, without toggling a boolean flag in the specified manner.
