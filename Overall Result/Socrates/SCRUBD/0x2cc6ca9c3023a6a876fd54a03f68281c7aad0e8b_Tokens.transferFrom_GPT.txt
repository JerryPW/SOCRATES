    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier notTimeLocked is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The modifier notTimeLocked enforces that specific addresses cannot execute the function if the current time is before timelockEndTime, unless they are
          addressSCICO or addressSCEscrow. This matches the first rule as it checks msg.sender against specific addresses. The condition "msg.sender != addressSCICO &&
          msg.sender != addressSCEscrow" ensures only these specified addresses can bypass the timelock restriction.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
