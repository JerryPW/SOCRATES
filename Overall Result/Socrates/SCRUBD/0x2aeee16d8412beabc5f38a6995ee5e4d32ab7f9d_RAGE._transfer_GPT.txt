Function Security Analysis for RAGE._transfer(address,address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _transfer.
    Check direct function security
        - function RAGE._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not include any statements that check if msg.sender is equal or not equal to any variable like xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO as required
          by the rules given.
        - function RAGE._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: None of the provided structures are present in the given code. There is a `require` statement in the code, but it does not relate to the setting of a
          variable to True or False as specified in the structures. Additionally, the variable manipulation regarding 'takeFee' does not follow the described patterns.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transferFrom', 'transfer']
        Function Security Analysis for RAGE.transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transferFrom.
            Check direct function security
                - function RAGE.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain any access control checks related to 'msg.sender'. It doesn't include any 'require', 'if', or 'assert' statements that
                  compare 'msg.sender' with specific 'xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO' roles or identities.
                - function RAGE.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code doesn't have a requirement or conditional statement that manipulates a boolean variable as described in the criteria. It involves
                  checking and updating an allowance which is numerical rather than boolean.

Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: RAGE.swapTokenForETH(uint256)
Function Security Analysis for RAGE.swapTokenForETH(uint256)
    The modifier of function swapTokenForETH are ['lockTheSwap']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier lockTheSwap is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The modifier 'lockTheSwap' sets a flag 'inSwap' to true at the beginning and resets it to false at the end. This indicates a lock operation, satisfying
          characteristic 2, which ensures the function runs once by utilizing a locking mechanism.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
