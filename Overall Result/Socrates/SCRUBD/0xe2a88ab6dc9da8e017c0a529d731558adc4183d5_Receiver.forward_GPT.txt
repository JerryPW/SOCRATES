Function Security Analysis for Receiver.forward(address,bytes,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function forward.
    Check direct function security
        - function Receiver.forward(address,bytes,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code contains 'require(msg.sender == implementation, ...);' where 'implementation' isn't explicitly one of the specified keywords like Owner,
          Address, Leader, or CEO.
        - function Receiver.forward(address,bytes,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code doesn't contain any of the required structures such as require(xxx == True); xxx = False;, require(xxx == False); xxx = True;, or any
          equivalent patterns.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['_to.call.value(_value+msg.value)(_data)']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - _to.call.value(_value+msg.value)(_data) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['_to.call.value(_value+msg.value)(_data)']
    Analyze External Address
        The variable '_to' in external call '_to.call.value(_value+msg.value)(_data)' has no state variable assigned in Receiver.forward(address,bytes,uint256). Therefore
        we check whether it has been hardcoded in the function.
            No In the given code, the variable '_to' is used as a function parameter, meaning it is expected to be provided as an argument when the function is called. It
            is not assigned a specific, constant value within the function body, and its value will depend on who calls the function and the arguments they pass to it.
            Therefore, '_to' is not hardcoded in the function.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
