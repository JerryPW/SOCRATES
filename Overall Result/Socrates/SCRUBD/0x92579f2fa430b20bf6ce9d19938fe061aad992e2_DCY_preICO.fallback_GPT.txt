Function Security Analysis for DCY_preICO.fallback()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
    Check direct function security
        - function DCY_preICO.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any require, if, or assert statements directly checking msg.sender against any specified owner or leader roles.
        - function DCY_preICO.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon reviewing the code more carefully, the structure only has the `require(!crowdsaleClosed);` statement, but does not have the subsequent
          `crowdsaleClosed = true;` within the function. The condition that would set `crowdsaleClosed = true;` is inside an `if` statement, hence it is conditional and
          not structurally directly after `require(!crowdsaleClosed);`. Therefore, it does not strictly match any of the defined structures in the rules given.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['tokenReward.getBalanceOf(address(this))', 'tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,amount/price)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,amount/price) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - tokenReward.getBalanceOf(address(this)) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,amount/price) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['tokenReward.getBalanceOf(address(this))', 'tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,amount/price)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['tokenReward'] should be checked in variable tokenReward
        Checked variables: tokenReward
            Yes 1. The function name 'DCY_preICO' matches the contract name, indicating it might be the constructor. 2. The state variable 'tokenReward' is set using a
            parameter 'addressOfTokenUsedAsReward', not hardcoded.
        There are ['tokenReward'] should be checked in variable tokenReward
        Checked variables: tokenReward
            Yes 1. The function 'DCY_preICO' matches the contract name 'DCY_preICO', indicating that it is a constructor. 2. The state variable 'tokenReward' is set
            within the function using a parameter 'addressOfTokenUsedAsReward', so it is not hardcoded. Given these reasons, the function satisfies one of the criteria by
            being a constructor.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
