Start analyze function: ProductionUnitToken.exit()
Function Security Analysis for ProductionUnitToken.exit()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function exit.
    Check direct function security
        - function ProductionUnitToken.exit() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code doesn't have any checks or assertions related to msg.sender being equal or not equal to a specific owner or leader address.
        - function ProductionUnitToken.exit() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided function does not contain any of the specified structures such as 'require(xxx == True); xxx = False;', 'require(!xxx); xxx = True;', or
          'if(!xxx) throw; xxx = true;'.

Start analyze function: ProductionUnitToken.withdraw()
Function Security Analysis for ProductionUnitToken.withdraw()
    The modifier of function withdraw are ['onlyStronghands']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier onlyStronghands has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier checks if 'myDividends(true) > 0' and doesn't inherently restrict access to specific owner or address, nor does it show a lock mechanism.
          It also doesn't have a name implying any restriction like owning or locking.
    Check direct function security
        - function ProductionUnitToken.withdraw() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function uses a modifier called 'onlyStronghands' to restrict access, but we do not have the definition of 'onlyStronghands' to determine if it
          specifically checks msg.sender against any owner or leader address.
        - function ProductionUnitToken.withdraw() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures involving 'require' statements or specific conditional logic as outlined in the
          characteristics to search for.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['_customerAddress.transfer(_dividends)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - _customerAddress.transfer(_dividends) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        '_customerAddress.transfer(_dividends)' contains the '.transfer(' keyword, satisfying the specified characteristic for this check.. Parameter in
        'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: ProductionUnitToken.sell(uint256)
Function Security Analysis for ProductionUnitToken.sell(uint256)
    The modifier of function sell are ['onlyBagholders']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier onlyBagholders has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier onlyBagholders checks if the caller has a token balance greater than 0 using require(myTokens() > 0). It does not enforce ownership or
          address-specific execution, nor does it implement a lock mechanism. It is not evidently an ownership or non-reentrancy modifier from its name.
    Check direct function security
        - function ProductionUnitToken.sell(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not use any conditional statements or assertions to directly check if msg.sender holds a specific role such as Owner, xxxAddress,
          Leader, or CEO. It uses the onlyBagholders modifier, but it is not included in the predefined structures in the criteria.
        - function ProductionUnitToken.sell(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any require statements or conditions that match the specified patterns involving a boolean variable being checked and then
          updated from true to false or vice versa.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['moonIncContract.handleProductionDecrease.value(_dividends)(_customerAddress,_tokens*cookieProductionMultiplier)']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - moonIncContract.handleProductionDecrease.value(_dividends)(_customerAddress,_tokens*cookieProductionMultiplier) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['moonIncContract.handleProductionDecrease.value(_dividends)(_customerAddress,_tokens*cookieProductionMultiplier)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['moonIncContract'] should be checked in variable moonIncContract
        Checked variables: moonIncContract
            Yes The function name "ProductionUnitToken" matches the contract name "ProductionUnitToken", indicating that this function is a constructor.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
