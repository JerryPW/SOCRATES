    Check direct function security
        - function WithdrawContract.withdraw() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any checks or assertions on msg.sender being a specific owner or address, as listed in the characteristics (1) to (4).
        - function WithdrawContract.withdraw() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code doesn't contain any of the required structures. The `require` statements in the code are not followed by the specified pattern of setting a
          variable to `False` or `True`, and subsequently setting it to the opposite value. No variable satisfies the entire structure required by the conditions given.

        Checked variables: rewardToken
            Yes The function name 'WithdrawContract' matches the contract name 'WithdrawContract', indicating that it is a constructor. Thus, it satisfies the first
            characteristic: being a constructor.
        There are ['rewardToken'] should be checked in variable rewardToken
        Checked variables: rewardToken
            Yes The function 'WithdrawContract' is a constructor because the function name matches the contract name 'WithdrawContract'. Constructors in Solidity are
            special functions and have the same name as the contract or are explicitly named 'constructor' in newer Solidity versions. This aligns with characteristics 1
            of the guidelines provided.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

                - function WithdrawContract.withdraw() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The given code does not contain any of the specified patterns related to checking `msg.sender` against a variable like
                  xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO. There are no explicit or implicit owner/leader checks based on the provided structures.
                - function WithdrawContract.withdraw() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures. It includes require statements and manipulations of the "i" and
                  "currentToken" variable, but none match the specified patterns involving setting and resetting a boolean variable around a require or if statement.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['_dest.send(_amount)', '_token.transfer(_dest,_amount)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - _dest.send(_amount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call '_dest.send(_amount)' contains
        the keyword '.send(', hence it satisfies the characteristic of containing '.send('.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - _token.transfer(_dest,_amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - _token.transfer(_dest,_amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['_token.transfer(_dest,_amount)']
    Analyze External Address
        The variable '_token' in external call '_token.transfer(_dest,_amount)' has no state variable assigned in
        WithdrawContract.doPayment(uint256,address,ERC20,uint256). Considering that it is an internal/private function, we analyze the function inputs.

            Checked variables: deposits
                No None of the functions in the provided code are named 'WithdrawContract' or 'constructor', or explicitly mentioned to be constructors. Furthermore, the
                state variable 'deposits' is not hardcoded in the newEtherDeposit or newTokenDeposit functions. Instead, deposits.length is used dynamically. Therefore,
                none of the two characteristics are met.
            Function Security Analysis for WithdrawContract.newEtherDeposit(uint256)
                The modifier of function newEtherDeposit are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The code in the modifier enforces that only the owner can execute the function by using require(msg.sender == owner); which directly matches
                      the characteristic noted in rule 1. Thus, the code satisfies characteristic 1.
            Function Security Analysis for WithdrawContract.newTokenDeposit(ERC20,uint256,uint256)
                The modifier of function newTokenDeposit are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The modifier contains a require statement 'require(msg.sender == owner);' which checks if the sender of the function call is the owner,
                      matching characteristic 1. No structural omissions are present as it directly matches the specified criteria.
            Function Security Analysis for WithdrawContract.cancelPaymentGlobally(uint256)
                The modifier of function cancelPaymentGlobally are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The code 'require (msg.sender == owner);' matches rule 1, enforcing that only the owner can execute the function. There are no omissions
                      since the modifier comprehends a complete structure based on this rule. There is no lock or unlock operation to consider, excluding rule 2.
            There are ['deposits'] should be checked in variable currentToken
            Checked variables: deposits
                No The provided functions are not constructors. The function names do not match the contract name 'WithdrawContract', nor are they explicitly named
                'constructor'. Additionally, none of the functions hardcode the 'deposits' state variable; instead, they dynamically manage it with operations like
                'deposits.length++' and 'deposits[_idDeposit]'. Therefore, none of the characteristics are satisfied.
