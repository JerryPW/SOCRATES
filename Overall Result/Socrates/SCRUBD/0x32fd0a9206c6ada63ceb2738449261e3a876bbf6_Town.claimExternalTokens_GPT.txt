Function Security Analysis for Town.claimExternalTokens(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function claimExternalTokens.
    Check direct function security
        - function Town.claimExternalTokens(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any checks or statements that involve 'msg.sender' compared to an 'Owner', 'Address', 'Leader', or 'CEO'. Therefore, it
          does not meet any of the specified structures.
        - function Town.claimExternalTokens(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code provided does not explicitly contain any of the required structures involving 'require' or 'if' statements as described in the problem
          statement. The function iterates over an array and performs operations, but it does not involve checking or updating any boolean variable in the required
          pattern.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['Token(externalTokensForHolder[i]).transfer(holder,_townHoldersLedger[holder][externalTokensForHolder[i]])']
    Analyze Transfer
        - Token(externalTokensForHolder[i]).transfer(holder,_townHoldersLedger[holder][externalTokensForHolder[i]]) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in
        'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - Token(externalTokensForHolder[i]).transfer(holder,_townHoldersLedger[holder][externalTokensForHolder[i]]) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['Token(externalTokensForHolder[i]).transfer(holder,_townHoldersLedger[holder][externalTokensForHolder[i]])']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['_ledgerExternalTokensAddresses'] should be checked in variable i
        Checked variables: _ledgerExternalTokensAddresses
            No 1. The provided code does not contain a constructor as neither of the function names match the contract name 'Town', nor is there any explicitly defined
            'constructor'. 2. The state variable '_ledgerExternalTokensAddresses' is used within the 'claimExternalTokens' function. In this function, it is used to
            retrieve the list of token addresses for a given holder, check its length, and then manipulate it (popping elements from it). However, this does not mean it
            is hardcoded in the function. Hardcoding implies that a value or decision logic is directly embedded into the code based on constants or specific known
            values.  Neither of these functions satisfies any of the characteristics mentioned.
            Function Security Analysis for Town.distributionSnapshot()
                There are no modifiers should be examined in function distributionSnapshot.
                Check direct function security
                    - function Town.distributionSnapshot() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                      Reason: The code does not contain any `require`, `if`, or `assert` statements that check the identity of `msg.sender` against predefined roles such
                      as `Owner`, `Address`, `Leader`, or `CEO`. Therefore, it does not satisfy any of the given characteristics.
                    - function Town.distributionSnapshot() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                      Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified patterns (e.g., 'require(xxx == True); xxx = False;', etc.)
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
