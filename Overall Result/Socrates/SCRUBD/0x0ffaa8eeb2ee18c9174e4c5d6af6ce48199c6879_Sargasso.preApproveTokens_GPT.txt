    There are no modifiers should be examined in function preApproveTokens.
    Check direct function security
        - function Sargasso.preApproveTokens(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function preApproveTokens does not contain any checks involving msg.sender against an xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, CEO, or similar entity. It
          checks conditions like secondaryUserLock, checkSubscription, hasKey, and specifiedToken against v2Address instead.
        - function Sargasso.preApproveTokens(address,uint256) has security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: In the provided code, the initial state check with 'require(secondaryUserLock[msg.sender] == false);' is followed by a state negation with
          'secondaryUserLock[msg.sender] = true;'. This change of state is immediately after the check and before the main logic of the function, which involves
          transferring tokens and updating amounts, executes. Therefore, the structure satisfies the requirements for performing the state negation before executing the
          main function logic.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
