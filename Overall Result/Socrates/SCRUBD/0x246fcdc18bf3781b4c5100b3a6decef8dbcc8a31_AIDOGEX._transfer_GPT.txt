    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _transfer.
    Check direct function security
        - function AIDOGEX._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified patterns related to checking `msg.sender`. There is no condition using `require`, `if`, or `assert` to
          specifically check `msg.sender` against a variable like xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO.
        - function AIDOGEX._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon reviewing the code again, I realize that I made a mistake in my previous response. The code contains `require(tradingEnabled, "Trading is not
          enabled yet");`, which is a requirement check, but it doesn't immediately follow with `tradingEnabled = false;` or `tradingEnabled = true;`. Likewise, for
          `inSwapAndLiquify`, it sets `inSwapAndLiquify = true;` and later `inSwapAndLiquify = false;`, but this assignment is not prefaced by
          `require(!inSwapAndLiquify);` or similar. Therefore, none of the structures as described are fully matched in the code.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transferFrom', 'transfer']
        Function Security Analysis for AIDOGEX.transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transferFrom.
            Check direct function security
                - function AIDOGEX.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not check if msg.sender is any Owner/Address/Leader/CEO.
                - function AIDOGEX.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code does not contain any 'require' statements or any 'if' statements that throw an error based on a condition involving a single
                  variable 'xxx'. It primarily deals with transferring a token and approving an allowance without the specified patterns.

    Analyze External Address
        There are ['uniswapV2Router'] should be checked in variable uniswapV2Router
        Checked variables: uniswapV2Router
            Yes 1. The provided code is a constructor because the function is explicitly named 'constructor'. 2. The constructor contains logic that assigns values to
            state variables, including 'uniswapV2Router', using hardcoded addresses based on the blockchain's ID. Therefore, it hardcodes the state variable specifically
            for different blockchains.
        There are ['marketingWallet'] should be checked in variable marketingWallet
        Checked variables: marketingWallet
            Yes The code provided includes a constructor for the contract, as identified by the 'constructor()' function in the code, which means it initializes variables
            and sets up state variables when the contract is deployed. Furthermore, the constructor explicitly sets the 'marketingWallet' state variable to a hardcoded
            address ('0xF88Db7a0e6fA4f0a36Bfc0e71AcC3F587aCCd700'). This satisfies the condition of checking whether the function is a constructor and whether it
            hardcodes the state variable. Therefore, the function satisfies the criteria.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Function Security Analysis for AIDOGEX.buybackAndBurn(uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function buybackAndBurn.
    Check direct function security
        - function AIDOGEX.buybackAndBurn(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures that check if msg.sender is equal to an owner's address.
        - function AIDOGEX.buybackAndBurn(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any 'require' or 'if' statements related to any variable and its modification. The logic check and update structure specified
          in the task description is missing.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

        Function Security Analysis for AIDOGEX.transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transferFrom.
            Check direct function security
                - function AIDOGEX.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The provided code does not have any checks or conditionals specifically involving 'msg.sender' compared against roles like 'xxxOwner',
                  'xxxAddress', 'Leader', or 'CEO'. There's no usage of 'require', 'assert', or 'if' with respect to 'msg.sender', as specified in the characteristics
                  list for evaluation.
                - function AIDOGEX.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the required structures involving the use of a variable 'xxx' with require statements or if(!xxx)
                  throw statements as described in the conditions.

            Yes The provided code snippet is indeed a constructor as identified by the presence of the keyword 'constructor'. Furthermore, the variable 'uniswapV2Router'
            is hardcoded within the constructor by assigning it to a specific address based on different blockchain IDs.
