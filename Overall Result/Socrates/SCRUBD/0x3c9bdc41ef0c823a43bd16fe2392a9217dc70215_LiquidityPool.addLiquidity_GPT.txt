    Analyze External Address
        There are ['pampToken'] should be checked in variable pampToken
        Checked variables: pampToken
            Yes The provided code snippet contains a constructor for the contract. It is indicated by the function named 'constructor' which initializes several state
            variables, including the 'pampToken'. The presence of the constructor satisfies the first characteristic because it is explicitly named 'constructor' and is
            used for initializing state variables when the contract is deployed. Additionally, the state variable 'pampToken' is hardcoded within the constructor, as seen
            by its assignment with a specific address, which satisfies the second characteristic as well.
        There are ['uniswapV2'] should be checked in variable uniswapV2
        Checked variables: uniswapV2
            Yes The code includes a constructor function, as indicated by the presence of the 'constructor()' function, which matches the typical constructor naming
            convention. This function initializes multiple state variables, including the 'uniswapV2'. It hardcodes the state variable 'uniswapV2' by assigning it a
            specific contract address (0x7a250d5630B4cF539739dF2C5dAcb4c659F2488D).
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
