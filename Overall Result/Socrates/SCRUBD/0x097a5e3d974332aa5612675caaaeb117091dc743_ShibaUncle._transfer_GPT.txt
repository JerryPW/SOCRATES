Function Security Analysis for ShibaUncle._transfer(address,address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _transfer.
    Check direct function security
        - function ShibaUncle._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The if condition checks if the addresses are not 'owner', but the check is against a variable (owner) and not explicitly against 'msg.sender', which
          does not match the required structure.
        - function ShibaUncle._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not match any of the provided structures since there are no require statements directly asserting `require(xxx == True)` or `require(xxx
          == False)` and then toggling `xxx` or similar logic structures with `if(!xxx) throw`.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transferFrom', 'transfer']
        Function Security Analysis for ShibaUncle.transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transferFrom.
            Check direct function security
                - function ShibaUncle.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not have any checks involving msg.sender with respect to specific roles like Owner or Leader.
                - function ShibaUncle.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any 'require' or 'if(!xxx) throw' statements, and it does not follow any of the specified structures: 1, 2, 3, or 4 as
                  no boolean assignments or conditions that match the pattern are present.

    Analyze External Address
        There are ['coolUncle'] should be checked in variable coolUncle
        Checked variables: coolUncle
            Yes The provided code includes a constructor function which is explicitly named 'constructor'. This satisfies the first characteristic in the criteria since
            constructors are specifically mentioned. Although there is a mention of the state variable 'coolUncle', it is not hardcoded as it is assigned a new instance
            of 'CoolUncle'.
        There are ['coolUncle'] should be checked in variable coolUncle
        Checked variables: coolUncle
            Yes The provided code is a constructor because it is named 'constructor' which matches the special function name in Solidity that defines a constructor. The
            constructor is hardcoding a state variable called 'coolUncle' as it is initialized with 'new CoolUncle();', showing that a new instance of 'CoolUncle' is
            being directly set without varying parameters.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: ShibaUncle.swapBack()
Function Security Analysis for ShibaUncle.swapBack()
    The modifier of function swapBack are ['lockTheSwap']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier lockTheSwap is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The modifier 'lockTheSwap' sets 'inSwapAndLiquify' to true before executing the function and sets it back to false after the function is executed,
          clearly demonstrating both lock and unlock operations within the same modifier. This enforces a lock mechanism, satisfying rule 2.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
