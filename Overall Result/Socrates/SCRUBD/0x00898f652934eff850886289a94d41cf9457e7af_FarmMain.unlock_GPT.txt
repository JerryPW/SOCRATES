        - modifier byPositionOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The code includes a requirement that checks if the message sender (msg.sender) is equal to the uniqueOwner of the position. This matches Rule 1, which
          involves ensuring that only the owner or specific addresses can execute the function. The relevant code segment is: 'require(_positions[positionId].uniqueOwner
          == msg.sender ...'. No lock operation is present, so Rule 2 does not apply.
