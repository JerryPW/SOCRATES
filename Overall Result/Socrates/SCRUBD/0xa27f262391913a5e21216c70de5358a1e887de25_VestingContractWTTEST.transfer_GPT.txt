Function Security Analysis for VestingContractWTTEST.transfer(address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function transfer.
    Check direct function security
        - function VestingContractWTTEST.transfer(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the specific checks for `msg.sender` being a specific owner or address (like Owner/Address/Leader/CEO) as outlined
          in the characteristics. Hence, it does not match the structure.
        - function VestingContractWTTEST.transfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not have any 'require(xxx == True)' or 'require(xxx == False)' structure, nor 'require(!xxx)' or 'if(!xxx) throw' structure defined under
          the given structural conditions. The 'require' statement is used with multiple conditions, but they do not match the specified structural patterns with the use
          of a single variable.

        - we_test_token.transfer(to,value) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['we_test_token.balanceOf(this)', 'we_test_token.transfer(to,value)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['we_test_token'] should be checked in variable we_test_token
        Checked variables: we_test_token
            Yes The function provided in the code is named 'VestingContractWTTEST', which matches the given contract name 'VestingContractWTTEST'. This indicates that it
            is a constructor function for the contract. Constructor functions are used for initializing a contract and setting up its initial state, typically by
            instantiating state variables like 'we_test_token'.
        There are ['we_test_token'] should be checked in variable we_test_token
        Checked variables: we_test_token
            Yes The function 'VestingContractWTTEST' shares its name with the contract, suggesting it's likely a constructor. Additionally, the state variable
            'we_test_token' is set using a parameter '_we_test_token', which is not hardcoded, meaning it does not satisfy the second characteristic.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
