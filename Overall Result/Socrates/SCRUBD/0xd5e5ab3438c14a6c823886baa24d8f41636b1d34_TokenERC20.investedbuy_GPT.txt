Function Security Analysis for TokenERC20.investedbuy(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function investedbuy.
    Check direct function security
        - function TokenERC20.investedbuy(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The check uses `require(msg.sender != _owner);` where `_owner` is a function parameter, making it a local variable rather than a predefined role like
          xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO specified in the rule.
        - function TokenERC20.investedbuy(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not contain any require statements checking for a boolean condition directly. Neither does it contain an 'if(!xxx) throw;'
          structure. The require statement used checks for inequality of addresses, not equality of a boolean.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['sender.send(amount)', 'a.send(msg.value*8/100)', 'a.send(msg.value*3/100)', 'a.send(msg.value*1/100)', 'a.send(msg.value*5/100)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - sender.send(amount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the '.send(' keyword,
        therefore it satisfies characteristic 2.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - a.send(msg.value*8/100) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the '.send('
        keyword, therefore it satisfies characteristic 2.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - a.send(msg.value*3/100) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the '.send('
        keyword, therefore it satisfies characteristic 2.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - a.send(msg.value*1/100) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the '.send('
        keyword, therefore it satisfies characteristic 2.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - a.send(msg.value*5/100) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the '.send('
        keyword, therefore it satisfies characteristic 2.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
