    Check direct function security
        - function EthTokenToSmthSwaps.withdrawNoMoney(bytes32,address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not have any checks related to `msg.sender` for specific owner or leader roles.
        - function EthTokenToSmthSwaps.withdrawNoMoney(bytes32,address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not contain any of the structures specified, such as requiring a specific Boolean condition on a variable and then changing that
          variable within the function body.

        There are ['swaps'] should be checked in variable swap
        Checked variables: swaps
            No 1. None of the functions in the provided code have the same name as the contract (`EthTokenToSmthSwaps`), nor is there any function explicitly named
            `constructor`. Thus, none of these functions are constructors. 2. The "swaps" state variable is used (e.g., as a mapping) within multiple functions (such as
            `createSwap`, `createSwapTarget`, `withdraw`, etc.) but there is no "hardcoded" use of "swaps" meaning it is not set to a specific, fixed value within these
            functions. Instead, it is being used dynamically based on input parameters and logic, which does not satisfy the criteria for hardcoding the state variable.
            Function Security Analysis for EthTokenToSmthSwaps.createSwap(bytes20,address,uint256,address)
                There are no modifiers should be examined in function createSwap.
                Check direct function security
                    - function EthTokenToSmthSwaps.createSwap(bytes20,address,uint256,address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                      Reason: The function does not contain any conditional checks involving msg.sender compared to an ownership or leadership role.
                    - function EthTokenToSmthSwaps.createSwap(bytes20,address,uint256,address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                      Reason: The given code does not contain any of the specified structures such as checking a variable with require followed by modifying that
                      variable.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
