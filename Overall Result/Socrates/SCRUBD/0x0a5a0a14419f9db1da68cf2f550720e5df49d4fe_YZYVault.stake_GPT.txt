Function Security Analysis for YZYVault.stake()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function stake.
    Check direct function security
        - function YZYVault.stake() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any access control checks related to specific addresses like 'xxxOwner', 'xxxAddress', 'Leader', or 'CEO'. It does not include
          any `require`, `if`, or `assert` statements with msg.sender being compared to an owner or leader address.
        - function YZYVault.stake() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon re-evaluation, the function contains 'require(!isContract(_msgSender())...' which matches the structure 3 pattern as \(!xxx\). However, it does not
          set \(isContract\) to true after that; hence, this does not meet the condition completely. No other structure fits the pattern provided.

    Check direct function security
        - function YZYVault.claimYzyReward() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function claimYzyReward does not contain any of the specified structures involving direct checks on msg.sender against an owner address or similar
          roles.
        - function YZYVault.claimYzyReward() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not match any of the given structures as it does not involve setting any boolean variable after a require statement or a conditional
          throw. It primarily involves require statements related to numeric checks and calls to other functions.

    Check direct function security
        - function YZYVault.claimSwapReward() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any specific check that aligns with the provided patterns for judging whether it has owner-specific conditions that limit the
          function execution to certain accounts or addresses. There are no checks like 'require(msg.sender == xxxOwner)', 'if (msg.sender != xxxOwner)', or
          'assert(msg.sender == xxxOwner)'. Therefore, the conditions are not met.
        - function YZYVault.claimSwapReward() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not have any require or if statements handling a boolean variable as specified in the conditions. The function mainly consists of
          processing rewards and updating staker information without requiring conditions based on boolean variables set or checked as 'true' or 'false'.

            No 1. The provided function name 'changeYzyAddress' does not match the contract name 'YZYVault', nor is it explicitly named 'constructor'. Hence, it is not a
            constructor. 2. The state variable '_yzy' is not hardcoded in the function 'changeYzyAddress'. It takes a parameter 'yzy' and assigns it to '_yzy', meaning it
            is dynamically set based on the input. Therefore, it does not satisfy this condition either.

                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: Rule 1 is satisfied because the code includes a require statement (require(_owner == _msgSender(), "Ownable: caller is not the owner")) that
                      enforces only the owner can execute the function. This directly checks if the message sender is the owner.

        - function YZYVault.safeYzyTransfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function does not contain any 'require' statement, nor any explicit check against a condition of a variable to control the flow as outlined in the
          structures. It only contains conditional logic to check if the amount is greater than the balance, and performs a transfer accordingly. Therefore, it doesn't

                  using require, if, or assert statements.
                - function YZYVault.claimYzyAvailableReward() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code doesn't match any of the required structures. There are no 'require(xxx == True)' or 'require(xxx == False)' statements, nor is there a
                  'require(!xxx)' or 'if(!xxx) throw'. The 'require' statements check if 'available' is greater than zero and if the transfer is successful, neither of

                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The modifier requires that _owner is equal to _msgSender(), enforcing only the owner can execute the function, which corresponds to
                      characteristic 1.
        There are ['_yzy'] should be checked in variable _yzy
        Checked variables: _yzy

                  xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO).
                - function YZYVault.stake() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code contains the statement "require(!isContract(_msgSender()), 'Vault: Could not be contract.');" where '!' is used to check a boolean
                  condition of a variable 'isContract' and throws if the condition is true. Then we have "require(swapAndLiquifyForYZY(msg.value), 'Vault: Failed to get
                  LP tokens.');" which doesn't modify that variable. So it satisfies the pattern 'require(!xxx);'. There is no sequence here where it is followed by 'xxx
                  = True'. Therefore, the code fits structure 3 only partially, but there seems to be a misunderstanding as it doesn't fit completely to satisfy the
                  pattern requirements strictly.

                  statement 'xxx = True;' is not present in the code. Thus, the structure is not fully matched.

        There are ['_uniswapV2Router'] should be checked in variable _uniswapV2Router
        Checked variables: _uniswapV2Router
            Yes The provided code is a constructor for the contract "YZYVault" as indicated by the function name "constructor" and the fact that it initializes several
            state variables. The function also assigns a hardcoded value to the state variable "_uniswapV2Router" by setting it to the address
            "0x7a250d5630B4cF539739dF2C5dAcb4c659F2488D". This satisfies both the characteristics laid out in the task: it is a constructor function, and it contains
            hardcoded values for state variables.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

    Check direct function security
        - function YZYVault.swapTokensForTokens(address,address,uint256,address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any condition that checks if msg.sender is a specific owner or address, nor does it involve assert or require statements
          with msg.sender checks.
        - function YZYVault.swapTokensForTokens(address,address,uint256,address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any require or if statement that matches any pattern provided in the characteristics.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['claimSwapReward', 'unstake', 'stake', 'stakeLPToken', '_swapAndClaimTokens', 'claimSwapAvailableReward']
        Function Security Analysis for YZYVault.claimSwapReward()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function claimSwapReward.
            Check direct function security
                - function YZYVault.claimSwapReward() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures that check if `msg.sender` is a specific owner or address.
                - function YZYVault.claimSwapReward() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code provided does not have a requirement or conditional statement modifying a boolean variable with the specific patterns described. It
                  primarily checks and operates based on numeric conditions and does not demonstrate any of the outlined structures involving a `require` or conditional
                  `throw` statement with consistent boolean manipulation.

    Analyze External Address
        There are ['_uniswapV2Router'] should be checked in variable _uniswapV2Router
        Checked variables: _uniswapV2Router
            Yes The provided code includes a constructor for the contract YZYVault. The function is explicitly named 'constructor'. The state variable '_uniswapV2Router'
            is indeed hardcoded within this constructor.
        The variable 'fromTokenAddress' in external call 'IERC20(fromTokenAddress).approve(address(_uniswapV2Router),tokenAmount)' has no state variable assigned in
        YZYVault.swapTokensForTokens(address,address,uint256,address). Considering that it is an internal/private function, we analyze the function inputs.
        Analyze External Address
            There are ['_yzy'] should be checked in variable _yzy
            Checked variables: _yzy
                No The external call in the function 'changeYzyAddress' modifies the state variable '_yzy'. However, this variable is not hardcoded within the function;
                instead, it is updated using a parameter 'yzy' which is passed into the function. Additionally, the function is not a constructor since its name
                'changeYzyAddress' does not match the contract name 'YZYVault' and it is not explicitly named 'constructor'.
            Function Security Analysis for YZYVault.changeYzyAddress(address)
                The modifier of function changeYzyAddress are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: Rule 1 is satisfied because the modifier contains the statement 'require(_owner == _msgSender())', which enforces that only the owner can
                      execute the function. The complete structure for Rule 1 is present, as the ownership is checked by requiring the caller to be the owner.
            There are ['_weth'] should be checked in variable _weth
            Checked variables: _weth
                Yes The code provided is a constructor for a contract named YZYVault. This is evident because the function is explicitly named 'constructor'.
                Additionally, the state variable _weth is not hardcoded but is set using a constructor parameter.
            There are ['_weth'] should be checked in variable _weth
            Checked variables: _weth
                Yes The code provided is a constructor function because the function is explicitly named 'constructor'. In Solidity, constructors are special functions
                that are executed only once when the contract is deployed. The presence of the 'constructor' keyword confirms that this function is a constructor.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
