Function Security Analysis for dexBlue.spendGasTokens(uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function spendGasTokens.
    Check direct function security
        - function dexBlue.spendGasTokens(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not involve any requirement, condition, or assertion checking the sender's address against an owner, address, leader, or similar role,
          which are the conditions specified to consider the function structure valid for the answer 'Yes'.
        - function dexBlue.spendGasTokens(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any structure that matches the specified patterns regarding the use of a variable with require or throw statement and
          subsequent assignments as described in the conditions.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['settleReserveReserveTradeWithData', 'settleTrade', 'userSigWithdrawal', 'settleRingTrade', 'settleReserveReserveTrade',
    'batchSettleTrades', 'settleReserveTradeWithData', 'settleReserveTrade', 'settleRingTradeWithData']
        Function Security Analysis for dexBlue.settleReserveReserveTradeWithData(dexBlueStructs.TradeInputPacked,bytes32[],bytes32[])
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function settleReserveReserveTradeWithData.
            Check direct function security
                - function dexBlue.settleReserveReserveTradeWithData(dexBlueStructs.TradeInputPacked,bytes32[],bytes32[]) has no security assurance protected by checking
                the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code contains a condition that checks if `msg.sender` is an arbiter through `require(arbiters[msg.sender] && marketActive);`, but it does
                  not explicitly use any identifiers like xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO as required by the problem statement.
                - function dexBlue.settleReserveReserveTradeWithData(dexBlueStructs.TradeInputPacked,bytes32[],bytes32[]) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing
                a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified patterns such as require(xxx == True), require(xxx == False), require(!xxx), or if(!xxx) throw
                  followed by specific variable assignment operations.

        There are ['gas_token_nonce_tail'] should be checked in variable i
        Checked variables: gas_token_nonce_tail
            No The function spendGasTokens is not a constructor since its name doesn't match the contract name 'dexBlue', nor is it explicitly named 'constructor'.
            Additionally, it does not have the state variable 'gas_token_nonce_tail' hardcoded, instead, it assigns the variable to a local variable 'tail' and operates
            on it first before re-assigning to the state variable at the end of the function. The function only uses 'gas_token_nonce_tail', making it dynamic rather than
            hardcoded.

                There are no modifiers should be examined in function spendGasTokens.
                Check direct function security
                    - function dexBlue.spendGasTokens(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                      Reason: The function has no checks involving msg.sender against xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO.
                    - function dexBlue.spendGasTokens(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                      Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures ("require" or `if` statements with logical checks against a variable
                      followed by mutable operations on the same variable).
                Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
                The reachable functions are ['settleReserveReserveTradeWithData', 'settleTrade', 'userSigWithdrawal', 'settleRingTrade', 'settleReserveReserveTrade',

                        Check direct function security
                            - function dexBlue.settleReserveReserveTradeWithData(dexBlueStructs.TradeInputPacked,bytes32[],bytes32[]) has no security assurance protected
                            by checking the authority of msg.sender
                              Reason: The code does not verify msg.sender to be equal or not equal to any xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
                            - function dexBlue.settleReserveReserveTradeWithData(dexBlueStructs.TradeInputPacked,bytes32[],bytes32[]) has no apparent security assurance
                            by utilizing a lock machinism.
                              Reason: The code does not satisfy any of the specified structural patterns. There are no 'require(xxx == True)' or 'require(xxx == False)'
                              statements setting a variable to the opposite boolean, nor are there 'require(!xxx)' or 'if(!xxx) throw' patterns present.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
