External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['msg.sender.send(eth)', 'namiToken.transferFrom(msg.sender,_buyer,maxToken)', 'namiToken.allowance(msg.sender,this)',
    'msg.sender.send(ethOfBuyer)', 'namiToken.transferFrom(msg.sender,_buyer,_value)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - msg.sender.send(eth) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains 'send(' keyword
        indicating a call with potential for gas-related issues.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - msg.sender.send(ethOfBuyer) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains 'send('
        keyword indicating a call with potential for gas-related issues.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - namiToken.transferFrom(msg.sender,_buyer,maxToken) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - namiToken.allowance(msg.sender,this) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - namiToken.transferFrom(msg.sender,_buyer,_value) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['namiToken.transferFrom(msg.sender,_buyer,maxToken)', 'namiToken.allowance(msg.sender,this)',
    'namiToken.transferFrom(msg.sender,_buyer,_value)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['NamiAddr'] should be checked in variable namiToken
        Checked variables: NamiAddr
            Yes The function given in the code snippet is named 'NamiExchange', which matches the contract name 'NamiExchange'. This indicates that the function is acting
            as a constructor, fulfilling the first characteristic for satisfying the conditions.  Additionally, the function assigns the parameter '_namiAddress' to the
            state variable 'NamiAddr'. Since '_namiAddress' is provided as an argument and not hardcoded within the function, it does not satisfy the second
            characteristic of having a hardcoded state variable.
        There are ['NamiAddr'] should be checked in variable namiToken
        Checked variables: NamiAddr
            Yes The provided function `NamiExchange` matches the contract name, indicating that it is a constructor.
        There are ['NamiAddr'] should be checked in variable namiToken
        Checked variables: NamiAddr
            Yes The provided function named 'NamiExchange' matches the contract name 'NamiExchange', indicating that it is a constructor function.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
