Function Security Analysis for EscrowGoods.yes(uint256,string,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function yes.
    Check direct function security
        - function EscrowGoods.yes(uint256,string,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code uses 'msg.sender' in a conditional check against local variables 'info.buyer' and 'seller', but it does not match any of the specified
          structures as 'info.buyer' and 'seller' are not explicitly defined contract owner variables like 'xxxOwner', 'xxxAddress', 'Leader', or 'CEO'.
        - function EscrowGoods.yes(uint256,string,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not meet any of the specified structures which include requirement clauses (like require or if-throw pairs) and specific assignment
          patterns.

Start analyze function: EscrowGoods.safeSend(address,uint256)
Function Security Analysis for EscrowGoods.safeSend(address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function safeSend.
    Check direct function security
        - function EscrowGoods.safeSend(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not address the identity of the msg.sender nor does it check against anything like xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO. Therefore, it doesn't
          match any of the provided structures.
        - function EscrowGoods.safeSend(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon reviewing the code again, the requirement checks are if(atomicLock) throw and atomicLock = true. These do not align with the required structures
          because the check should be if(!atomicLock) throw. Therefore, the structure doesn't match any of the specified patterns.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

            There are no modifiers should be examined in function yes.
            Check direct function security
                - function EscrowGoods.yes(uint256,string,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The condition if(msg.sender != info.buyer && msg.sender != seller) involves checking msg.sender against local variables (info.buyer and seller),
                  which does not satisfy the criteria for being considered as comparing against a specified owner/leader role such as xxxOwner or xxxAddress.
                - function EscrowGoods.yes(uint256,string,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures: There are conditional checks using `if` statements with `return`, yet they neither
                  explicitly require assignments to the same variable outlined in the criteria nor use a `require` statement.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['addr.call.gas(safeGas).value(value)()']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - addr.call.gas(safeGas).value(value)() is subjected to gas limits safeGas <= 3000. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The provided
        code snippet is a smart contract written in Solidity for a blockchain environment (likely Ethereum). Within the code, the variable `safeGas` is a constant set to
        25000, which is much less than 3000. This is determined by this line of code:  ```solidity uint constant safeGas = 25000; ```  As `safeGas` is explicitly defined
        as a constant with a specific value, it will always hold the value of 25000 whenever it is referenced in the contract. Given this, `safeGas` will always be less
        than or equal to 3000 regardless of how it is used within the function calls or what operations are performed with it. Hence, True is returned because `safeGas`
        remains constant at 25000 throughout the contract's execution.  The only arithmetic operations or logical conditions that could alter the value are those that
        might depend on its usage within conditionals or other calculations. Yet, these operations do not modify the constant but use it as an unchanging reference. Thus,
        the actual value of `safeGas` itself remains unchanged.  Therefore, the value assigned to `safeGas` in this code is definitely always less than or equal to 3000.
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
