    The modifier of function claim are ['noContractsAllowed', 'nonReentrant']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier noContractsAllowed has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier does not match any of the given rules, as it does not restrict execution to owner or specific addresses, and it does not include any lock
          operation or indicate such with its name.
        - modifier nonReentrant is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The modifier includes a lock operation by setting `_status = _ENTERED;` at the beginning and resetting it with `_status = _NOT_ENTERED;` at the end of
          the modifier, ensuring the modifier structure for preventing re-entrancy is complete. This matches rule 2, as it uses both lock and unlock operations to enforce
          single entry during function execution.
