Function Security Analysis for DCY_preICO.bringBackTokens()
    The modifier of function bringBackTokens are ['afterDeadline']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier afterDeadline has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier checks if the current time is greater than or equal to a 'deadline', which is unrelated to ownership or reentrancy prevention.
    Check direct function security
        - function DCY_preICO.bringBackTokens() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function uses 'if (msg.sender == beneficiary)', but 'beneficiary' is not a term like 'Owner', 'Address', 'Leader', or 'CEO' required by the prompt.
          Therefore, it does not match the specified structure based on the variable name requirement.
        - function DCY_preICO.bringBackTokens() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code contains a 'require' statement that checks if 'tokensLeft > 0'. However, there is no subsequent assignment of 'tokensLeft = False' or
          'tokensLeft = True'. Therefore, none of the specified structures are present in the code.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['tokenReward.transfer(beneficiary,tokensLeft)', 'tokenReward.getBalanceOf(address(this))']
    Analyze Transfer
        - tokenReward.transfer(beneficiary,tokensLeft) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - tokenReward.transfer(beneficiary,tokensLeft) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - tokenReward.getBalanceOf(address(this)) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['tokenReward.transfer(beneficiary,tokensLeft)', 'tokenReward.getBalanceOf(address(this))']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['tokenReward'] should be checked in variable tokenReward
        Checked variables: tokenReward
            Yes The provided code is likely a constructor because the function name 'DCY_preICO' matches the contract name 'DCY_preICO'. Additionally, the code sets the
            state variable 'tokenReward' directly using the parameter 'addressOfTokenUsedAsReward'. Therefore, this satisfies the first characteristic of checking whether
            the provided code is a constructor.
        There are ['tokenReward'] should be checked in variable tokenReward
        Checked variables: tokenReward
            Yes The function name 'DCY_preICO' matches the contract name 'DCY_preICO', indicating that the function is a constructor. Constructors typically initialize
            state variables, which is what is happening here with the 'tokenReward' state variable being set. Therefore, the first characteristic (the function being a
            constructor) is satisfied.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
