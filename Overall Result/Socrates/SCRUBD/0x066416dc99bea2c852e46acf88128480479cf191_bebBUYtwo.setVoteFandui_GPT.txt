Function Security Analysis for bebBUYtwo.setVoteFandui()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function setVoteFandui.
    Check direct function security
        - function bebBUYtwo.setVoteFandui() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code checks if msg.sender has voted by requiring !_user.vote, but doesn't restrict actions based on msg.sender being a particular owner or leader.
        - function bebBUYtwo.setVoteFandui() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code structure involving 'require(!_user.vote)' and '_user.vote = true' does not meet the additional requirement that the state negation operation
          (i.e., '_user.vote = true') must occur immediately after the check and before the main logic. In this code, there are statements executing the main logic like
          'bebTokenTransferBET.transferFrom', 'BEBfandui+=_value', and '_user.amounts=_value'. Thus, the structure does not fully satisfy the given conditions for
          immediate state negation before the main logic.

        - bebTokenTransferBET.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),_value) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['bebTokenTransferBET.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),_value)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['bebTokenTransferBET'] should be checked in variable bebTokenTransferBET
        Checked variables: bebTokenTransferBET
            Yes 1. The function name 'bebBUYtwo' matches the contract name 'bebBUYtwo', which indicates that the provided code is a constructor. 2. The state variable
            'bebTokenTransferBET' is hardcoded within the constructor through the call to 'tokenTransferBET(_BETadderss)'.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: bebBUYtwo.getTokenBalanceBET(address)
Function Security Analysis for bebBUYtwo.getTokenBalanceBET(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function getTokenBalanceBET.
    Check direct function security
        - function bebBUYtwo.getTokenBalanceBET(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code only retrieves the token balance from a specified address and does not involve any sender check or require statement.
        - function bebBUYtwo.getTokenBalanceBET(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code provided is a simple function to get the token balance of a specific address using another function 'balanceOf'. This code does not satisfy any
          of the predefined structures where there is a 'require' or 'if' statement followed by a change in boolean variable value.
External Call Analysis

    Analyze Gas
        - bebTokenTransferBET.balanceOf(_addr) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['bebTokenTransferBET.balanceOf(_addr)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['bebTokenTransferBET'] should be checked in variable bebTokenTransferBET
        Checked variables: bebTokenTransferBET
            Yes The function 'bebBUYtwo' matches the contract name 'bebBUYtwo', indicating that this is the constructor for the contract as per characteristic 1.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
