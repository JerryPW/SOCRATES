Function Security Analysis for FUEGO.transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function transferFrom.
    Check direct function security
        - function FUEGO.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any condition checking if 'msg.sender' is equal to or not equal to Owner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO roles.
        - function FUEGO.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not fulfill any of the required structures. The 'require' keyword is used but not with a boolean variable being explicitly set to True or
          False afterwards.

Start analyze function: FUEGO._transfer(address,address,uint256)
Function Security Analysis for FUEGO._transfer(address,address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _transfer.
    Check direct function security
        - function FUEGO._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not include any checks where `msg.sender` is directly compared to an owner, leader, or CEO address, which are the conditions listed in the
          provided characteristics.
        - function FUEGO._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any structures matching the defined patterns, which involve checking and flipping boolean variable states.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transferFrom', '_transfer', 'transfer', 'swapForTokenomics']
        Function Security Analysis for FUEGO.transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transferFrom.
            Check direct function security
                - function FUEGO.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures that involve checking 'msg.sender'.
                - function FUEGO.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not satisfy any of the given structures because it contains a 'require' statement with a condition on 'amount', not a boolean
                  variable being set to true or false. The pattern requires checking a boolean variable, which is not present in the require statement of this function.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: []
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: FUEGO.swapForTokenomics(uint256)
Function Security Analysis for FUEGO.swapForTokenomics(uint256)
    The modifier of function swapForTokenomics are ['lockTheSwap']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier lockTheSwap is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The modifier `lockTheSwap` sets the variable `inSwapAndLiquify` to true before the function execution and resets it to false afterward, fulfilling both
          conditions of a lock-then-unlock mechanism, indicating a reentrancy lock.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
