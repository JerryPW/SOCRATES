Function Security Analysis for DogeviathanBasic.createCollectible()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function createCollectible.
    Check direct function security
        - function DogeviathanBasic.createCollectible() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any specification that restricts msg.sender to be a specific owner (like xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO) in the require, if,
          or assert statements.
        - function DogeviathanBasic.createCollectible() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not include either structure 1, 2, 3, or 4, as there's no matching require or if check with subsequent variable assignment to a
          negated state in the way described.

    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _safeMint.
    Check direct function security
        - function ERC721._safeMint(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The given code does not include any require, if, or assert statements that check if msg.sender is equal to specific roles like xxxOwner, xxxAddress,
          Leader, or CEO, nor does it prevent access with such conditions.
        - function ERC721._safeMint(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given function does not contain any of the required structures. There are no requirements, assignments, or conditional throws involving a boolean
          variable as specified.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

                - function DogeviathanBasic.createCollectible() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain any conditional checks or assertions involving msg.sender as xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO.
                - function DogeviathanBasic.createCollectible() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures that involve changing a variable's boolean state after a require statement checking
                  the opposite boolean state.

Function Security Analysis for ERC721._checkOnERC721Received(address,address,uint256,bytes)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _checkOnERC721Received.
    Check direct function security
        - function ERC721._checkOnERC721Received(address,address,uint256,bytes) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The provided function does not contain any conditions that check the msg.sender against any xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO identifiers as per the
          specified characteristics.
        - function ERC721._checkOnERC721Received(address,address,uint256,bytes) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not satisfy any of the specified structures because it does not contain any statement matching the specified patterns such as
          require(xxx == True); or setting a value to True or False based on any conditional check related to a require(!xxx); structure.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

            Check direct function security
                - function ERC721.safeTransferFrom(address,address,uint256,bytes) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function only checks if the caller is an approved operator or owner, not specifically if it is a particular owner/address, such as a
                  Leader/CEO.
                - function ERC721.safeTransferFrom(address,address,uint256,bytes) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The function does not match any of the specified structures. It lacks both the required statements and the optional statements outlined in the
                  patterns.

    Analyze External Address
        The variable 'to' in external call 'to.functionCall(abi.encodeWithSelector(IERC721Receiver(to).onERC721Received.selector,_msgSender(),from,tokenId,_data),ERC721:t
        ransfertononERC721Receiverimplementer)' has no state variable assigned in ERC721._checkOnERC721Received(address,address,uint256,bytes). Considering that it is an
        internal/private function, we analyze the function inputs.
        Analyze External Address
            The variable 'to' in external call 'to' has no state variable assigned in ERC721._safeTransfer(address,address,uint256,bytes). Considering that it is an
            internal/private function, we analyze the function inputs.
            Analyze External Address
                The variable 'to' in external call 'to' has no state variable assigned in ERC721.safeTransferFrom(address,address,uint256,bytes). Therefore we check
                whether it has been hardcoded in the function.
                    No The variable 'to' is used as a parameter in the function 'safeTransferFrom' and is not hardcoded within the function body. It is passed as an
                    argument when the function is called, so its value can vary depending on the caller's input.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
