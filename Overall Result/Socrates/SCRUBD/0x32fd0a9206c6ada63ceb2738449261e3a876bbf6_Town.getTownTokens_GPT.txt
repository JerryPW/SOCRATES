          assignments that match the described patterns.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['_token.transfer(holder,tokenBalance)', '_remunerationsQueue[i]._address.transfer(amount)', 'msg.sender.transfer(change)',
    '_remunerationsQueue[i_scope_1]._address.transfer(amount)', '_remunerationsQueue[i]._address.transfer(_remunerationsQueue[i]._amount)',
    '_remunerationsQueue[i_scope_1]._address.transfer(_remunerationsQueue[i_scope_1]._amount)', '_token.transfer(holder,tokenAmount)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - _token.transfer(holder,tokenBalance) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - _remunerationsQueue[i]._address.transfer(amount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        '_remunerationsQueue[i]._address.transfer(amount)' contains the '.transfer(' keyword, satisfying the condition.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - msg.sender.transfer(change) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        'msg.sender.transfer(change)' includes the '.transfer(' keyword, thereby satisfying the condition.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - _remunerationsQueue[i_scope_1]._address.transfer(amount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: This call
        '_remunerationsQueue[i_scope_1]._address.transfer(amount)' includes the '.transfer(' keyword, thus it satisfies the condition.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - _remunerationsQueue[i]._address.transfer(_remunerationsQueue[i]._amount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the
        reason: The call '_remunerationsQueue[i]._address.transfer(_remunerationsQueue[i]._amount)' contains the '.transfer(' keyword. Hence, it meets the guideline..
        Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - _remunerationsQueue[i_scope_1]._address.transfer(_remunerationsQueue[i_scope_1]._amount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem.
        Here is the reason: The call '_remunerationsQueue[i_scope_1]._address.transfer(_remunerationsQueue[i_scope_1]._amount)' contains '.transfer(', fulfilling the
        condition.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - _token.transfer(holder,tokenAmount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - _token.transfer(holder,tokenBalance) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - _token.transfer(holder,tokenAmount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['_token.transfer(holder,tokenBalance)', '_token.transfer(holder,tokenAmount)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['_token'] should be checked in variable _token
        Checked variables: _token
            Yes The provided code includes a constructor, as indicated by the function named 'constructor'. This matches one of the specified characteristics to look out
            for: a constructor named according to the contract name or explicitly named 'constructor'. This confirms that the function is indeed designed to initialize
            the contract when it is deployed.
        There are ['_token'] should be checked in variable _token
        Checked variables: _token
            Yes The provided function is a constructor because it is explicitly named 'constructor'. According to the rules, any function explicitly named 'constructor'
            is identified as such, satisfying the first characteristic.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
