Function Security Analysis for MappingTokenFactory.createTokenMapped(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function createTokenMapped.
    Check direct function security
        - function MappingTokenFactory.createTokenMapped(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any condition that checks msg.sender against being a specific owner type entity such as Owner, Leader, CEO, or Address.
        - function MappingTokenFactory.createTokenMapped(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code contains a `require` statement and subsequently changes the state of a variable related to the condition checked; however, none of the
          specified structures (checking and updating a boolean condition on the same variable) are present.

        - InitializableProductProxy(address(tokenMapped)).__InitializableProductProxy_init(address(this),_TokenMapped_,abi.encodeWithSignature(__TokenMapped_init(address,
        address),address(this),token)) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.

    Analyze External Address
        The variable 'tokenMapped' in external call 'InitializableProductProxy(address(tokenMapped)).__InitializableProductProxy_init(address(this),_TokenMapped_,abi.enco
        deWithSignature(__TokenMapped_init(address,address),address(this),token))' has no state variable assigned. Therefore we check whether it has been hardcoded in the
        function.
            No The variable 'tokenMapped' in the code is not hardcoded. Rather, it is assigned dynamically to the result of a deployment of a new contract instance using
            the 'create2' opcode, which generates an address based on certain inputs such as the deployment code and salt value. This indicates that the 'tokenMapped'
            address is computed at runtime and depends on the 'token' address and the current chain's state, rather than being fixed or hardcoded in the code.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
