        There are ['xEtherTokensContract'] should be checked in variable xEtherTokensContract
        Checked variables: xEtherTokensContract
            No 1. The function name 'setXEtherContract' does not match the contract name 'XetherGames' and is not explicitly named 'constructor', so it is not a
            constructor. 2. The function code assigns a value to 'xEtherTokensContract' but does not use a hardcoded value; it takes 'xEtherContract' as a parameter.
            Hence, it is dynamic and not hardcoded. Therefore, the function does not satisfy any of the given conditions.
            Function Security Analysis for XetherGames.setXEtherContract(address)
                The modifier of function setXEtherContract are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The modifier contains 'require(msg.sender == owner)' which matches the criteria of enforcing that only the owner can execute the function.
                      This corresponds to structure 1, which checks whether the code enforces that only the owner can execute the function.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
