    Check direct function security
        - function X3ProfitMainFundTransfer.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not involve a direct or logical check ensuring msg.sender is equal or not equal to an Owner/Address/Leader/CEO before executing
          sensitive operations. It only checks msg.sender in context of conditions like safe status or specific contract addresses which are not qualifying indicators for
          security controls against roles like Owner/Leader or similar.
        - function X3ProfitMainFundTransfer.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon reevaluation, the code does not fulfill any of the specified structures completely. In the provided code, `isResend` is set to `msg.sender ==
          ADDRESS_EIFP2_CONTRACT` and later to `false`, but it is not used in a condition like `require(!isResend)` or `require(isResend == True)`. Furthermore, it
          doesn't contain both required statements as listed in any one of the four structures. Thus, the judgement of 'Yes' was incorrect; it should be 'No'.
