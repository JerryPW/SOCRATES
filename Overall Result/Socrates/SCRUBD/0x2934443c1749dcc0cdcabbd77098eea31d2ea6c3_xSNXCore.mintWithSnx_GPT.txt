    Analyze External Address
        There are ['snxAddress'] should be checked in variable snxAddress
        Checked variables: snxAddress
            Yes The code provided is a constructor function because it matches the typical characteristics of a constructor. Despite the absence of an explicit
            'constructor' keyword, the function is named 'constructor', and it initializes the contract by setting its state variables using the provided parameters. This
            constructor indeed initializes the 'snxAddress' state variable using the '_snxAddress' parameter, hardcoding it as part of the contract initialization.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
