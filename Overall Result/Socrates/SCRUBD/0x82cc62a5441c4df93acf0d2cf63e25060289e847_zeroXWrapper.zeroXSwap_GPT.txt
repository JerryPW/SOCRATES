          manipulations fitting the structures specified.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['forwarder.call.value(msg.value)(args)']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - forwarder.call.value(msg.value)(args) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['forwarder.call.value(msg.value)(args)']
    Analyze External Address
        The variable 'forwarder' in external call 'forwarder.call.value(msg.value)(args)' has no state variable assigned. Therefore we check whether it has been hardcoded
        in the function.
            No The forwarder variable is a parameter of the function zeroXSwap and is used within the function without any explicit assignment to a predefined value. It
            is assigned within the function dynamically, based on the function call input when the function is executed.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
