    There are no modifiers should be examined in function determinePID.
    Check direct function security
        - function MonkeyScam.determinePID(LDdatasets.EventReturns) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any checks or statements relating to msg.sender that match the specified structures.
        - function MonkeyScam.determinePID(LDdatasets.EventReturns) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any 'require' or 'if' statements that check a boolean condition before setting it to true or false. It does not match any of
          the specified structures.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['buyXid', 'buyXname', 'fallback', 'buyXaddr']
        Function Security Analysis for MonkeyScam.buyXid(uint256)
            The modifier of function buyXid are ['isActivated', 'isHuman', 'isWithinLimits']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier isActivated has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier 'isActivated' only checks whether `activated_` is set to true and does not enforce owner or address-specific execution nor does it
                  involve a lock operation. The name 'isActivated' does not imply ownership restriction or reentrancy prevention.
                - modifier isHuman has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier does not enforce ownership or specific addresses. It checks if the caller is a human (EOA) based on the extcodesize of the sender's
                  address. It does not use a lock or contain likely names like 'OnlyOwner' or 'nonReentrant'.
                - modifier isWithinLimits has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier checks for input value limits but does not enforce ownership or a lock mechanism. It is not related to owner-based access control
                  or non-reentrancy protections.
            Check direct function security
                - function MonkeyScam.buyXid(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any direct check on msg.sender against specific roles like owner or leader.
                - function MonkeyScam.buyXid(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not have any explicit 'require' statements or 'if(!xxx) throw;' structures that involve setting a variable subsequently.
                  Therefore, none of the defined structures that match the conditions are present.
