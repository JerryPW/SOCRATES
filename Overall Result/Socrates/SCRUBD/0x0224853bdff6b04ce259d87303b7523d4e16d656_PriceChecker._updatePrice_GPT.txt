    Check direct function security
        - function PriceChecker._updatePrice() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any conditions or assertions involving msg.sender. It only involves logic related to querying and checking balances.
        - function PriceChecker._updatePrice() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not have any of the required structures. There's no 'require' statement or logical condition that directly sets the same variable to both
          true and false, either as a part of an if-check, require, or a throw condition.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['constructor', 'constructor', 'updatePrice']

            Check direct function security
                - function PriceChecker.updatePrice() has security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The previous judgement 'Yes' was based on the presence of 'require(msg.sender == priceCheckerAddress);' which matches structure 1. However,
                  there is no mention that 'priceCheckerAddress' is a local variable in the provided code, so the initial assessment remains valid.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
