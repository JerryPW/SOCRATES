Function Security Analysis for Crowdsale.fallback()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
    Check direct function security
        - function Crowdsale.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code doesn't contain any of the specific authentication patterns listed, such as ensuring the function can only be called by a specific owner or
          address.
        - function Crowdsale.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon reviewing the provided code again, we find only the statement 'require(!crowdsaleClosed && msg.value <= 2 ether);' which partially matches the
          first requirement of structure 3. However, the second required statement 'crowdsaleClosed = True' after 'require(!crowdsaleClosed)' is missing. Therefore, it
          does not fully match the criteria of the structure as both key statements are necessary. None of the four specified structures are fully present in the code.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['beneficiary.send(amount)', 'tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,sendTokens)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - beneficiary.send(amount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call contains '.send(' keyword..
        Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,sendTokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,sendTokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,sendTokens)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['tokenReward'] should be checked in variable tokenReward
        Checked variables: tokenReward
            Yes The provided code snippet for the 'Crowdsale' contract contains a function named 'Crowdsale', which matches the contract name. This indicates that this
            function is a constructor for the contract. Furthermore, within this function, the state variable 'tokenReward' is indeed being hardcoded with the address
            '0x12AC8d8F0F48b7954bcdA736AF0576a12Dc8C387'. Hence, both conditions for satisfying the characteristics are met.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
