    There are no modifiers should be examined in function distributeDividend.
    Check direct function security
        - function DividendDistributor.distributeDividend(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code doesn't check for the sender's identity against a specific owner or leader role using any of the specified patterns.
        - function DividendDistributor.distributeDividend(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures. It begins with a conditional check (if statement), but there's no requirement or setting
          of a variable as explicitly true or false coupled with a 'require' or 'if(!xxx) throw' statement as described in the conditions.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['process', 'claimDividend', 'setShare']
        Function Security Analysis for DividendDistributor.process(uint256)
            The modifier of function process are ['onlyToken']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyToken is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The modifier contains 'require(msg.sender == _token);', which enforces that only the specific address stored in _token can execute the function.
                  This matches characteristic 1, which is about enforcing ownership or specific address execution through a requirement condition.
        Function Security Analysis for DividendDistributor.claimDividend()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function claimDividend.
            Check direct function security
                - function DividendDistributor.claimDividend() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function 'claimDividend' does not contain any conditions that check if 'msg.sender' matches a specified owner or authorized address, like

                - function DividendDistributor.claimDividend() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code provided doesn't contain any statement like require(xxx == True), require(xxx == False), require(!xxx), or if(!xxx) throw. There are no
                  manipulations of a boolean variable in a way that matches the specified structure.
