Function Security Analysis for RCpro.takeEther(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function takeEther.
    Check direct function security
        - function RCpro.takeEther(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not check msg.sender against a specific owner, address, leader, or CEO using require, if, or assert statements as described. It primarily
          deals with other operational checks.
        - function RCpro.takeEther(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: None of the required patterns are present in the code.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['fallback', 'buyTokensFor', 'releaseTokensTo', 'buyTokens', 'buyImplementation']
        Function Security Analysis for RCpro.fallback()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
            Check direct function security
                - function RCpro.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The provided code does not contain any pattern where msg.sender is explicitly compared to xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO using require,
                  if, or assert.
                - function RCpro.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: None of the given structures (1 to 4) are present in the code. The code primarily consists of a require statement checking a condition related
                  to time, without variable assignments that fit the listed structures.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['_buyer.transfer(refund)', 'tokenSaleContract.decimals()', 'tokenSaleContract.tokenValueInEther(tknPriceApplied)',
    'tokenInterface(tokenSaleContract.tokenContract()).balanceOf(tokenSaleContract)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - _buyer.transfer(refund) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: This external call contains the '.transfer('
        keyword, indicating it satisfies the condition.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - tokenSaleContract.decimals() ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - tokenSaleContract.tokenValueInEther(tknPriceApplied) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - tokenInterface(tokenSaleContract.tokenContract()).balanceOf(tokenSaleContract) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['tokenSaleContract.decimals()', 'tokenSaleContract.tokenValueInEther(tknPriceApplied)',
    'tokenInterface(tokenSaleContract.tokenContract()).balanceOf(tokenSaleContract)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['tokenSaleContract'] should be checked in variable tokenSaleContract
        Checked variables: tokenSaleContract
            Yes 1. The function name 'RCpro' matches the contract name, indicating that this function is a constructor. 2. The state variable 'tokenSaleContract' is being
            assigned from the input '_tokenSaleContract', thus it is not hardcoded. Since the function name matches the contract name, it satisfies the first
            characteristic.
        There are ['tokenSaleContract'] should be checked in variable tokenSaleContract
        Checked variables: tokenSaleContract
            Yes The provided function is named 'RCpro', which matches the contract's name 'RCpro'. This indicates that the function is a constructor in Solidity versions
            before 0.4.22, where constructors were named after the contract. As it satisfies the first characteristic, it qualifies based on the rules outlined.
        There are ['tokenSaleContract'] should be checked in variable tokenSaleContract
        Checked variables: tokenSaleContract
            Yes 1. The function name "RCpro" matches the contract name "RCpro", indicating that it is likely a constructor. 2. The state variable "tokenSaleContract" is
            being hardcoded in the constructor as it is directly set from the constructor parameter "_tokenSaleContract".
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
