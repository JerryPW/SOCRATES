Function Security Analysis for ShortOrder.exerciseLong(address[2],uint256[8],uint8,bytes32[2])
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function exerciseLong.
    Check direct function security
        - function ShortOrder.exerciseLong(address[2],uint256[8],uint8,bytes32[2]) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not include any checks for msg.sender being equal or not equal to xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO, using require, assert, or if with throw
          as described in the provided structures.
        - function ShortOrder.exerciseLong(address[2],uint256[8],uint8,bytes32[2]) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon reviewing the code, the initial statement is 'else if(!orderRecord[msg.sender][orderHash].tokenDeposit)', which matches the format 'if(!xxx)'.
          However, there is no subsequent 'xxx = true' or equivalent assignment regarding 'orderRecord[msg.sender][orderHash].tokenDeposit'. Therefore, the required
          structure is incomplete, and the code does not fully match any provided structures.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['msg.sender.transfer(safeAdd(couponAmount,orderRecord[tokenUser[1]][orderHash].longBalance[msg.sender]))', 'msg.sender.transfer(couponAmount)',
    'Token(tokenUser[0]).transfer(msg.sender,amount)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - msg.sender.transfer(safeAdd(couponAmount,orderRecord[tokenUser[1]][orderHash].longBalance[msg.sender])) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no
        potential REE problem. Here is the reason: This external call contains the '.transfer(' keyword, which satisfies the first characteristic.. Parameter in
        'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - msg.sender.transfer(couponAmount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: This external call contains the
        '.transfer(' keyword, which satisfies the first characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - Token(tokenUser[0]).transfer(msg.sender,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['Token(tokenUser[0]).transfer(msg.sender,amount)']
    Analyze External Address
        The variable 'tokenUser' in external call 'Token(tokenUser[0]).transfer(msg.sender,amount)' has no state variable assigned. Therefore we check whether it has been
        hardcoded in the function.
            No The 'tokenUser' variable is used as an input parameter for the function and is utilized within internal calculations and logic, rather than having a
            constant fixed value within the code.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
