    Check direct function security
        - function BoomerangLiquidity.payout() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any require, if, or assert statement checking msg.sender against xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
        - function BoomerangLiquidity.payout() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code snippet does not contain any of the specified patterns. It uses a require statement, but it checks for `balance > 1`, which does not
          match any of the specified conditions that involve logical operations with equality to True or False. There are no assignments that follow the pattern `xxx =
          False` or `xxx = True` that correspond to the logical requirements provided.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.call.value(payoutToSend).gas(1000000)()', 'flmContract.buy.value(investment)(msg.sender)']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - The gas limit in participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.call.value(payoutToSend).gas(1000000)() is 1000000, which is too high. Therefore, it will not prevent
        REE problem.
        - flmContract.buy.value(investment)(msg.sender) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['participants[payoutOrder].etherAddress.call.value(payoutToSend).gas(1000000)()', 'flmContract.buy.value(investment)(msg.sender)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['participants'] should be checked in variable participants
        Checked variables: participants
            No The provided function names 'deposit' and 'payout' do not match the contract name 'BoomerangLiquidity', nor are they named 'constructor'. Additionally, the
            state variable 'participants' is not hardcoded in either function, as its manipulation involves dynamic operations such as pushing new participants and
            modifying their attributes based on conditions. Therefore, neither function satisfies the conditions for a 'Yes' response.
            Function Security Analysis for BoomerangLiquidity.deposit()
                There are no modifiers should be examined in function deposit.
                Check direct function security
                    - function BoomerangLiquidity.deposit() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                      Reason: The code does not contain any require, if, or assert statements that check the sender's address against any owner or leader addresses.
                    - function BoomerangLiquidity.deposit() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                      Reason: The code snippet does not contain any of the specified structures such as 'require(xxx == True); xxx = False;', 'require(xxx == False); xxx
                      = True;', 'require(!xxx); xxx = True;', or 'if(!xxx) throw; xxx = true;'. It only accepts deposits from users and adds them to a participant list.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
