    Check direct function security
        - function TYRANT.internalTransfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any condition that explicitly checks if 'msg.sender' is equal or not equal to an owner, specific address, leader or CEO.
        - function TYRANT.internalTransfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: None of the structures specified in the guidance are present in the code. The code contains multiple require statements, but they do not follow the
          specified patterns such as changing a boolean variable after checking its state.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['AirDrop', 'transfer', 'withdrawStuckTokens', 'transferFrom', 'manualBurnTokensFromLP']
        Function Security Analysis for TYRANT.AirDrop(address[],uint256[])
            The modifier of function AirDrop are ['onlyOwner']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The code contains a 'require' statement that checks if the caller (_msgSender()) is the same as the owner. This ensures that only the owner can
                  execute the function, satisfying the conditions of characteristic 1. There are no lock operations present in the modifier which would relate to
                  characteristic 2.

            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transfer.
            Check direct function security
                - function TYRANT.transfer(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain a requirement, if statement, or assertion to check if msg.sender is equal to any xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
                - function TYRANT.transfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The given code does not include any of the required conditional statements or assignments as per the specified patterns. It only calls another
                  function and returns a boolean value.

Start analyze function: TYRANT.taxTokenSwap()
Function Security Analysis for TYRANT.taxTokenSwap()
    The modifier of function taxTokenSwap are ['lockTheSwap']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier lockTheSwap is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The code defines the lock operation by setting the flag 'inSwapAndLiquify' to true before executing the rest of the function, and resets it to false
          afterward. Both lock and unlock conditions are met.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
