    There are no modifiers should be examined in function matchOrderWithReserveWithData.
    Check direct function security
        - function dexBlueSettlementModule.matchOrderWithReserveWithData(dexBlueStructs.Order,address,dexBlueStructs.ReserveTrade,bytes32[]) has no security assurance
        protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any statement checking whether msg.sender is equal or not equal to any owner, address, leader, or CEO variable. It is only
          dealing with conditions related to order matching and execution.
        - function dexBlueSettlementModule.matchOrderWithReserveWithData(dexBlueStructs.Order,address,dexBlueStructs.ReserveTrade,bytes32[]) has no apparent security
        assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures within the function `matchOrderWithReserveWithData`. There's no 'require' statement
          ensuring a boolean condition followed by directly manipulating the same boolean variable, nor is there an 'if(!xxx) throw' structure present in the function.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['settleReserveTradeWithData']
        Function Security Analysis for dexBlueSettlementModule.settleReserveTradeWithData(dexBlueStructs.OrderInputPacked,dexBlueStructs.TradeInputPacked,bytes32[])
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function settleReserveTradeWithData.
            Check direct function security
                - function dexBlueSettlementModule.settleReserveTradeWithData(dexBlueStructs.OrderInputPacked,dexBlueStructs.TradeInputPacked,bytes32[]) has no security
                assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code uses require(arbiters[msg.sender] && marketActive);, which checks if msg.sender is an arbiter and the market is active. However,
                  'arbiters[msg.sender]' doesn't qualify as 'xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO' within the function as specified.
                - function dexBlueSettlementModule.settleReserveTradeWithData(dexBlueStructs.OrderInputPacked,dexBlueStructs.TradeInputPacked,bytes32[]) has no apparent
                security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code snippet does not match any of the specified structures. It does not contain a require statement on a boolean variable with an
                  assignment to its opposite value.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call:
    ['address(this).call.gas(trade.gasLimit)(abi.encodePacked(dexBlue(address(0)).executeReserveTradeWithData.selector,abi.encode(order.sellToken,trade.orderAmount-

    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - address(this).call.gas(trade.gasLimit)(abi.encodePacked(dexBlue(address(0)).executeReserveTradeWithData.selector,abi.encode(order.sellToken,trade.orderAmount-
        trade.reserveFee,order.buyToken,trade.reserveAmount-trade.reserveRebate,reserve,data))) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Here is the reason: The code snippet
        doesn't provide any information or context regarding the assignment to the variable `trade.gasLimit`. There are no operations, calculations, or function calls
        that define or manipulate this variable within the provided snippet. Since there is no information to analyze, it is impossible to determine whether the value
        assigned to `trade.gasLimit` is always less than or equal to 3000.  Therefore, without further context, code, or constraints, we cannot judge the truthfulness of
        the statement that the assignment to `trade.gasLimit` is always <= 3000.
    Remaining external call:
    ['address(this).call.gas(trade.gasLimit)(abi.encodePacked(dexBlue(address(0)).executeReserveTradeWithData.selector,abi.encode(order.sellToken,trade.orderAmount-
    trade.reserveFee,order.buyToken,trade.reserveAmount-trade.reserveRebate,reserve,data)))']
    Analyze External Address
        External call
        address(this).call.gas(trade.gasLimit)(abi.encodePacked(dexBlue(address(0)).executeReserveTradeWithData.selector,abi.encode(order.sellToken,trade.orderAmount-
        trade.reserveFee,order.buyToken,trade.reserveAmount-trade.reserveRebate,reserve,data))) calls contract address, which consider no REE problem.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
