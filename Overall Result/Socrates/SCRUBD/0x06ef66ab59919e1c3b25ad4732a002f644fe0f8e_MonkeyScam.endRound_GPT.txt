Function Security Analysis for MonkeyScam.endRound(LDdatasets.EventReturns)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function endRound.
    Check direct function security
        - function MonkeyScam.endRound(LDdatasets.EventReturns) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not include any conditional checks for msg.sender against a specific owner, address, Leader, or CEO role as required in the given
          structures.
        - function MonkeyScam.endRound(LDdatasets.EventReturns) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function does not contain any 'require' statements or 'if' conditions followed by 'throw'. It primarily involves computations and updates related to
          game round outcomes without specific conditional checks that match the described structures.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['reLoadCore', 'reLoadXname', 'buyXname', 'fallback', 'buyCore', 'reLoadXaddr', 'buyXaddr', 'withdraw', 'reLoadXid', 'buyXid']
        Function Security Analysis for MonkeyScam.reLoadCore(uint256,uint256,uint256,LDdatasets.EventReturns)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function reLoadCore.
            Check direct function security
                - function MonkeyScam.reLoadCore(uint256,uint256,uint256,LDdatasets.EventReturns) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of
                msg.sender
                  Reason: The function doesn't contain any checks or assertions related to msg.sender being an owner, address, leader, or CEO. Therefore, it does not
                  match any of the specified structures mentioned in the characteristics.
                - function MonkeyScam.reLoadCore(uint256,uint256,uint256,LDdatasets.EventReturns) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the required patterns, such as a require statement for a boolean variable with a subsequent boolean assignment
                  to the same variable, as described in the conditions.
            Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
            The reachable functions are ['reLoadXid', 'reLoadXname', 'reLoadXaddr']
                Function Security Analysis for MonkeyScam.reLoadXid(uint256,uint256)
                    The modifier of function reLoadXid are ['isActivated', 'isHuman', 'isWithinLimits']
                    The result of checking modifiers:
                        - modifier isActivated has no relation with controlled by owner.
                          Reason: The code checks an activation flag, but it does not enforce an owner or specific address execution nor uses a lock operation. The
                          modifier does not follow characteristics 1, 2, or suggest it by its name.
                        - modifier isHuman has no relation with controlled by owner.
                          Reason: The code in the modifier does not satisfy any of the specific characteristics outlined in the rules. It does not enforce owner or
                          specific address execution (Rule 1), and it does not use locking mechanisms (Rule 2), nor does it have a name that implies these checks (Rule
                          3).
                        - modifier isWithinLimits has no relation with controlled by owner.
                          Reason: The modifier checks a condition on the amount of Ether sent, but it does not enforce any owner or specific address execution requirement
                          (Rule 1), nor does it perform any lock operation (Rule 2). Additionally, the modifier's name is not indicative of ownership or reentrancy
                          protection (Rule 3). Therefore, none of the specific characteristics are satisfied.
                    Check direct function security
                        - function MonkeyScam.reLoadXid(uint256,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                          Reason: The function doesn't contain any checks or conditions based on the 'msg.sender' variable against a specific owner or authorized address.
                        - function MonkeyScam.reLoadXid(uint256,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                          Reason: The given code does not contain any of the required structures where a boolean variable (xxx) is required or checked with a require
                          statement or an 'if' statement, assigned true or false, and optionally flipped back. This function is only managing variables related to player
                          IDs and affiliate codes.
