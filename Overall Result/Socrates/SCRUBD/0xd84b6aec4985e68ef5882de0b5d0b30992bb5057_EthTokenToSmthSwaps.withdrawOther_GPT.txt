    Analyze External Address
        There are ['swaps'] should be checked in variable swap
        Checked variables: swaps
            No The provided code does not contain a constructor since none of the function names match the contract name "EthTokenToSmthSwaps" and there is no function
            explicitly named 'constructor'. Additionally, none of the functions have the state variable 'swaps' hardcoded with a fixed or default value; they all appear
            to perform logic or operations on the 'swaps' state variable based on input parameters or other dynamic values. Therefore, the conditions for the
            characteristics are not met.
            Function Security Analysis for EthTokenToSmthSwaps.createSwap(bytes20,address,uint256,address)
                There are no modifiers should be examined in function createSwap.
                Check direct function security
                    - function EthTokenToSmthSwaps.createSwap(bytes20,address,uint256,address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                      Reason: The function 'createSwap' does not contain any access control structures matching the specified characteristics that involve checking
                      'msg.sender' against an owner or leader address.
                    - function EthTokenToSmthSwaps.createSwap(bytes20,address,uint256,address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                      Reason: The provided code doesn't meet any of the specified structures. There are 'require' statements, but they do not pertain to checking a single
                      condition and toggling its state. Instead, they are general purpose checks for input validation.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
