External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['player_[_affID2].addr.transfer(_aff)', 'player_[_affID1].addr.transfer(_aff)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - player_[_affID2].addr.transfer(_aff) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains
        '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - player_[_affID1].addr.transfer(_aff) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains
        '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
