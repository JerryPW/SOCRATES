External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['address(subscription._member).transfer(subscription._buyAmount)', '_targetToken.safeTransfer(subscription._member,subscription._buyAmount)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - address(subscription._member).transfer(subscription._buyAmount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The
        call contains the '.transfer(' keyword, so it satisfies the characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - _targetToken.safeTransfer(subscription._member,subscription._buyAmount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['_targetToken.safeTransfer(subscription._member,subscription._buyAmount)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['_targetToken'] should be checked in variable _targetToken
        Checked variables: _targetToken
            Yes 1. The function name 'init' does not match the contract name 'Daoclub' and it is not explicitly named 'constructor', so it is not a constructor function.
            2. The function does hardcode specific smart contract addresses for certain conditions (e.g., for target symbols 'USDT' and 'USDC'), assigning them to the
            '_targetToken' state variable. These are literal address values hardcoded within the function logic, meeting the criteria for hardcoded state variable
            assignment.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
