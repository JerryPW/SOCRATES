Function Security Analysis for TokenERC20.withdrawcommissions()
    The modifier of function withdrawcommissions are ['olyowner']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier olyowner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: Upon reviewing the code again, it still aligns with characteristic 1. The modifier 'olyowner' includes the line 'require(msg.sender == owner ||
          msg.sender == aipi);', which explicitly enforces the restriction on function execution to the addresses 'owner' and 'aipi'. This satisfies the requirement of
          checking if the caller's address matches specific addresses, as per the given rules. There is no indication of a lock mechanism that would point to
          characteristic 2.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
