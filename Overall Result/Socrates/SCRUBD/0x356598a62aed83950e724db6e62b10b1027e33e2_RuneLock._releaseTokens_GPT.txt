Function Security Analysis for RuneLock._releaseTokens(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _releaseTokens.
    Check direct function security
        - function RuneLock._releaseTokens(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the required msg.sender checks or assertions involving the "==" or "!=" operators with "xxxOwner" or similar roles.
        - function RuneLock._releaseTokens(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the required structures. There is no use of require or if statements controlling the flow based on a boolean
          variable, nor setting a boolean to True or False in this manner.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['release']
        Function Security Analysis for RuneLock.release(address)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function release.
            Check direct function security
                - function RuneLock.release(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain any existing conditions or checks which compare msg.sender against xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO. Instead, it
                  verifies token amounts and release times for the sender.
                - function RuneLock.release(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code provided does not meet any of the required structures for outputting 'Yes'. There is no 'require' statement that checks for a boolean
                  condition or assigns it to True or False following that requirement. Instead, the code primarily deals with checking if a token is available for release
                  and managing token lock timing.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['IERC20(_tokenAddress).transfer(msg.sender,_amount)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - IERC20(_tokenAddress).transfer(msg.sender,_amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - IERC20(_tokenAddress).transfer(msg.sender,_amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['IERC20(_tokenAddress).transfer(msg.sender,_amount)']
    Analyze External Address
        The variable '_tokenAddress' in external call 'IERC20(_tokenAddress).transfer(msg.sender,_amount)' has no state variable assigned in
        RuneLock._releaseTokens(address). Considering that it is an internal/private function, we analyze the function inputs.
        Analyze External Address
            The variable '_tokenAddress' in external call '_tokenAddress' has no state variable assigned in RuneLock.release(address). Therefore we check whether it has
            been hardcoded in the function.
                No The function `release` uses the `_tokenAddress` parameter in a dynamic way. It is fetched from a mapping `beneficiaryToLockedTokens` and
                `beneficiaryToReleaseTime` using information about the sender and the provided `_tokenAddress`. The `_tokenAddress` is key for retrieving the relevant
                data for the transaction, and it isn't fixed or pre-determined in the code.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
