Function Security Analysis for RC.giveToken(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function giveToken.
    Check direct function security
        - function RC.giveToken(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function giveToken does not contain any of the specified structures involving msg.sender, such as require, if, or assert with msg.sender compared to
          an owner or equivalent entity.
        - function RC.giveToken(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code contains the statement 'require( pendingTokenUser[_buyer] > 0 );', which checks a condition, but it does not set a boolean variable to True or
          False afterward. None of the conditions are met from the provided characteristic structures.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

        Function Security Analysis for KYCBase.buyImplementation(address,uint64,uint256,uint8,bytes32,bytes32)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function buyImplementation.
            Check direct function security
                - function KYCBase.buyImplementation(address,uint64,uint256,uint8,bytes32,bytes32) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of
                msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain any condition directly involving 'msg.sender' as a comparison with 'xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO'. All conditions
                  focus on 'signer' and 'alreadyPayed', without directly comparing or assigning 'msg.sender'.
                - function KYCBase.buyImplementation(address,uint64,uint256,uint8,bytes32,bytes32) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: Upon reviewing the code, the structure requires 'if(!xxx) throw;' where 'xxx' has to be the same variable name in both conditions. The code uses
                  'if (!isKycSigner[signer])' which meets the first condition to potentially throw, but lacks any assignment of the 'xxx' variable (isKycSigner[signer])
                  to true later in the code. Therefore, the code lacks the structural requirement of setting 'xxx' to true after the conditional. Thus, the function
                  doesn't fully meet condition 4.
            Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
            The reachable functions are ['buyTokens', 'buyTokensFor']
                Function Security Analysis for KYCBase.buyTokens(uint64,uint256,uint8,bytes32,bytes32)
                    There are no modifiers should be examined in function buyTokens.
                    Check direct function security
                        - function KYCBase.buyTokens(uint64,uint256,uint8,bytes32,bytes32) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                          Reason: The function does not use any of the specified structures to compare or handle msg.sender with any xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO.
                        - function KYCBase.buyTokens(uint64,uint256,uint8,bytes32,bytes32) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the required structures involving 'require' or 'if' statements with specific conditions on a
                          boolean variable (xxx), and corresponding assignments to that variable (from True to False or False to True).
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['tokenSaleContract.wallet().transfer(etherUser[_buyer])', 'tokenSaleContract.claim(_buyer,pendingTokenUser[_buyer])']
    Analyze Transfer
        - tokenSaleContract.wallet().transfer(etherUser[_buyer]) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external
        call 'tokenSaleContract.wallet().transfer(etherUser[_buyer])' contains the '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - tokenSaleContract.claim(_buyer,pendingTokenUser[_buyer]) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['tokenSaleContract.claim(_buyer,pendingTokenUser[_buyer])']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['tokenSaleContract'] should be checked in variable tokenSaleContract
        Checked variables: tokenSaleContract
            Yes The function name 'RC' matches the contract name 'RC', indicating that this is a constructor. Constructors initialize contracts and are defined using the
            contract name in versions of Solidity before 0.4.22. Additionally, the function does not hardcode the state variable 'tokenSaleContract' as its value comes
            from an external input '_tokenSaleContract'. Since the function is identified as a constructor, the output is 'Yes'.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
