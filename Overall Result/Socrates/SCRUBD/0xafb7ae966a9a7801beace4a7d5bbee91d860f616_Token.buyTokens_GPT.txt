Function Security Analysis for Token.buyTokens(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function buyTokens.
    Check direct function security
        - function Token.buyTokens(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: This code doesn't involve checks related to the authority or identity of the msg.sender like comparing to an owner or similar authority figure.
        - function Token.buyTokens(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures because it lacks both the requirement checks and the following assignments for the same
          variable as described.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['fallback']
        Function Security Analysis for Token.fallback()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
            Check direct function security
                - function Token.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any msg.sender checks against an identifier like xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
                - function Token.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The function does not contain any of the required structures. There is no 'require' or 'if(!xxx) throw' statement checking a variable and then
                  setting it to 'True' or 'False'.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['token.transfer(_buyer,tokens)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - token.transfer(_buyer,tokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - token.transfer(_buyer,tokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['token.transfer(_buyer,tokens)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            No 1. The provided function is named 'tokenAddress', which does not match the contract name 'Token'. Also, it is not explicitly named 'constructor'.
            Therefore, it is not a constructor.  2. The function uses a parameter '_token' to update the state variable 'token'. It does not hardcode the state variable
            because it takes the address from the function input. Hence, it does not satisfy the hardcoding condition.  Since neither characteristics are met, the
            function does not satisfy the conditions provided.
            Function Security Analysis for Token.tokenAddress(address)
                The modifier of function tokenAddress are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The code explicitly uses 'require(msg.sender == owner);' to ensure that only the owner can execute the function. This matches the first
                      characteristic, where the code enforces that only the owner or specific addresses can execute the function. There are no structural omissions in
                      this part as it clearly satisfies the condition.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: Token.tokenBalance()
Function Security Analysis for Token.tokenBalance()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function tokenBalance.
    Check direct function security
        - function Token.tokenBalance() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures that involve checking 'msg.sender'. It simply returns the balance of tokens held by the
          contract.
        - function Token.tokenBalance() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided function does not contain any of the specified structures. It simply returns the token balance involving a function call to 'balanceOf' and
          does not use 'require' or 'if' statements with variable setting as described
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['token.balanceOf(address(this))']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - token.balanceOf(address(this)) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['token.balanceOf(address(this))']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            No 1. The function 'tokenAddress' is not a constructor since it does not match the contract name 'Token' and is not explicitly named 'constructor'.  2. The
            function does reference the state variable 'token', but it does not hardcode its value, as it takes '_token' as a parameter instead of assigning a hardcoded
            value.
            Function Security Analysis for Token.tokenAddress(address)
                The modifier of function tokenAddress are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The code uses 'require(msg.sender == owner);' to enforce that only the owner can execute the function, which matches characteristic 1. There
                      are no omissions as the modifier clearly restricts execution to the owner only.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
