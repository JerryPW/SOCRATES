    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _transfer.
    Check direct function security
        - function ChipToken._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not check `msg.sender` for ownership or specific roles using the specified patterns.
        - function ChipToken._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code contains a line using ! with a variable (require(!blacklist[from] && !blacklist[to], "sender or recipient is blacklisted!";) but the
          accompanying line does not change the state of the same variable. There are no other conditions from the specified structures found in the function.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transferFrom', 'transfer']
        Function Security Analysis for ChipToken.transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transferFrom.
            Check direct function security
                - function ChipToken.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not include any checks or structures where msg.sender is compared to an owner, address, Leader, or CEO, such as require(msg.sender
                  == xxxOwner) or if (msg.sender != xxxOwner)... etc.
                - function ChipToken.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any require statements or if statements throwing exceptions with the specified structures involving a single variable
                  being both checked and then altered. Consequently, none of the patterns are present.

Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: ChipToken.swap()
Function Security Analysis for ChipToken.swap()
    The modifier of function swap are ['lockTheSwap']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier lockTheSwap is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The modifier code 'lockTheSwap' enforces a lock operation by setting 'inSwap' to true before the function executes and resets it to false afterward.
          This matches both the lock and unlock operation criteria in rule 2, thus confirming the initial judgment is correct.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
