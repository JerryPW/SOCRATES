Function Security Analysis for ViVICO.refund()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function refund.
    Check direct function security
        - function ViVICO.refund() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: This function doesn't strictly check for the sender being a specific 'Owner', 'Address', 'Leader' or 'CEO'. It checks for a sender with a certain
          permission level, but this doesn't satisfy any specified structure in the prompt.
        - function ViVICO.refund() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code snippet contains the structure where 'require(state == State.Failed);' followed by 'state = SomeValue;' statement (in this case, variable
          'state' is compared with State.Failed and state is modified after some operations), and this is the structure where a certain state is required to be met, and
          if successful, state changes might happen, but since we don't have this mechanism of changing require variable directly in this example, and there are no other
          matchable constructs in line with given characteristics, so this code does not fulfill the conditions provided. But strictly speaking for the specific required
          pattern of check and flip after a specific require, there is no direct match.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['tokenReward.transfer(creator,remanent)', 'tokenReward.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),holderTokens)',
    'creator.transfer(address(this).balance)', 'tokenReward.balanceOf(this)', 'msg.sender.transfer(holderETH)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - tokenReward.transfer(creator,remanent) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - creator.transfer(address(this).balance) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains
        the '.transfer(' keyword, which satisfies characteristic 1.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - msg.sender.transfer(holderETH) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the
        '.transfer(' keyword, which satisfies characteristic 1.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - tokenReward.transfer(creator,remanent) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - tokenReward.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),holderTokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - tokenReward.balanceOf(this) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['tokenReward.transfer(creator,remanent)', 'tokenReward.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),holderTokens)', 'tokenReward.balanceOf(this)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['tokenReward'] should be checked in variable tokenReward
        Checked variables: tokenReward
            Yes The code provided is a constructor as it is explicitly named 'constructor'. It sets the value of the state variable 'tokenReward' using the parameter
            '_addressOfTokenUsedAsReward', but it does not hardcode the 'tokenReward'. The condition satisfied is that it is a constructor function.
        There are ['tokenReward'] should be checked in variable tokenReward
        Checked variables: tokenReward
            Yes The provided code contains a function that is explicitly named 'constructor', which matches the characteristic of a constructor. In Solidity, a
            'constructor' is a special function that is executed once at the time of contract creation and can be used to initialize state variables or set values. Hence,
            this external call satisfies the first condition.
        There are ['tokenReward'] should be checked in variable tokenReward
        Checked variables: tokenReward
            Yes The given function is a constructor, as it is explicitly named 'constructor'. Moreover, it sets the state variable 'tokenReward' with the provided
            parameter '_addressOfTokenUsedAsReward'.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
