Function Security Analysis for HeroLedger.withdrawERC20Balance(uint256)
    The modifier of function withdrawERC20Balance are ['onlyLeader']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier onlyLeader is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The modifier 'onlyLeader' uses a require statement to verify that the function caller's address (msg.sender) is equal to 'leaderAddress'. This satisfies
          characteristic 1, which checks whether the function enforces that only specific addresses can execute it. The require statement is correctly identified and
          there are no structural omissions regarding this characteristic. The code does not address characteristic 2, as there is no indication of a lock operation using
          flags in this modifier, and characteristic 3 does not apply since the function name suggests access control for a specific user ('Leader').
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
