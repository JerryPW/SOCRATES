Function Security Analysis for TheWarBlueNation.Sort()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function Sort.
    Check direct function security
        - function TheWarBlueNation.Sort() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function contains no conditionals or assertions that involve checking the identity of 'msg.sender' against any specified roles like xxxOwner,
          xxxAddress, Leader, CEO, etc.
        - function TheWarBlueNation.Sort() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not include any 'require' statements or 'if' conditions with throw that set and verify a variable to True or False, as specified in the
          structures provided.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['fallback']
        Function Security Analysis for TheWarBlueNation.fallback()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
            Check direct function security
                - function TheWarBlueNation.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function uses `require(msg.value>=0.01 ether);` which does not involve checking `msg.sender` against a specific owner or address.
                - function TheWarBlueNation.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified patterns. There's a require statement, but it doesn't check for boolean equivalence ('== True' or
                  '== False') of a variable nor is there any assignment to 'True' or 'False' for a variable related to the require statement. Therefore, it doesn't match
                  any of the given structures.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['owner.send(feecounter)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - owner.send(feecounter) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the '.send('
        keyword, which matches the second condition for an eligible characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
