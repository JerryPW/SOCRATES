Function Security Analysis for Swap.fallback()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
    Check direct function security
        - function Swap.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code only checks if 'check[msg.sender] == false' but does not directly compare 'msg.sender' to any specific owner or reserved roles within the
          require, if, or assert statements.
        - function Swap.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The structure 'require(check[msg.sender] == false);' is followed by the main logic of the function and ends with 'check[msg.sender] = true;' after
          several operations, indicating the state negation does not occur immediately after checking. Therefore, it does not meet the additional requirement for
          immediate state negation before executing main logic.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['swapaddress.transfer(msg.sender,amount/secondvalue)', 'swapaddress.transfer(msg.sender,amount/newvalue)',
    'swapaddress.transfer(msg.sender,amount/third)', 'beneficiary.send(msg.value)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - swapaddress.transfer(msg.sender,amount/secondvalue) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - swapaddress.transfer(msg.sender,amount/newvalue) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - swapaddress.transfer(msg.sender,amount/third) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - beneficiary.send(msg.value) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the '.send('
        keyword, which matches the second characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - swapaddress.transfer(msg.sender,amount/secondvalue) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - swapaddress.transfer(msg.sender,amount/newvalue) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - swapaddress.transfer(msg.sender,amount/third) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['swapaddress.transfer(msg.sender,amount/secondvalue)', 'swapaddress.transfer(msg.sender,amount/newvalue)',
    'swapaddress.transfer(msg.sender,amount/third)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['swapaddress'] should be checked in variable swapaddress
        Checked variables: swapaddress
            Yes The provided code contains a constructor function for the contract 'Swap'. The function is explicitly named 'constructor', which is a typical way to
            declare a constructor in Solidity after version 0.4.22. In this constructor, the state variable 'swapaddress' is being set using the parameter
            'addressOfCollectibleUsedAsReward'.
        There are ['swapaddress'] should be checked in variable swapaddress
        Checked variables: swapaddress
            Yes The function provided is a constructor because it has the name 'constructor' which matches the constructor naming convention explicitly. It sets the state
            variable 'swapaddress' within it, thus fulfilling the constructor check condition.
        There are ['swapaddress'] should be checked in variable swapaddress
        Checked variables: swapaddress
            Yes The function in question is a constructor because it is defined with the same name as the contract, which is 'Swap'. Furthermore, the function does set
            the state variable 'swapaddress' by assigning it the result of a function call with the parameter 'addressOfCollectibleUsedAsReward', but this is not a
            hardcoded value. Therefore, the function satisfies the first characteristic of being a constructor.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
