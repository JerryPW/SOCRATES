    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier nonReentrant is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The code initially increments a guard counter (_guardCounter) and stores its value in a local variable (localCounter). After the function logic
          (indicated by _;), it checks that the localCounter is equal to _guardCounter. This sequence corresponds to a lock operation and an implicit unlock by validating
          the counter at the end, which aligns with Rule 2. Moreover, the modifier's name 'nonReentrant' suggests a non-reentrancy feature, supporting Rule 3.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
