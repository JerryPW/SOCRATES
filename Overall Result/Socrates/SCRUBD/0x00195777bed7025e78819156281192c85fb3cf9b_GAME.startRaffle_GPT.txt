Function Security Analysis for GAME.startRaffle(uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function startRaffle.
    Check direct function security
        - function GAME.startRaffle(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not use any of the specified structures for access control related to msg.sender verification like require(msg.sender == xxxOwner), if
          (msg.sender != xxxOwner) or assert(msg.sender == xxxOwner). Instead, it uses require and if statements that do not involve msg.sender.
        - function GAME.startRaffle(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the matching structures specified in the criteria (1, 2, 3, or 4). The require statement checks for `ticketsBought ==
          ticketPool` but does not set `ticketsBought` to a new value immediately after. Additionally, the check does not involve a False or True value directly, nor does
          it use '!xxx'.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['__callback', '__callback']

            Check direct function security
                - function GAME.__callback(bytes32,string,bytes) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code contains 'require (msg.sender == oraclize_cbAddress());', but 'oraclize_cbAddress()' is not a pattern defined by the
                  xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO in structures 1, 2, 3, or 4.
                - function GAME.__callback(bytes32,string,bytes) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not exhibit any of the specified structures. There are no require or if statements followed by changes to the same variable where
                  it changes from True to False or vice versa.

    'winner.transfer(winnerPrize.add((jackpot.mul(jackpotFactor)).div(100)))']
    Analyze Transfer
        - winner.transfer(winnerPrize) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains '.transfer('
        keyword, which matches the first characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - winner.transfer(winnerPrize.add((jackpot.mul(jackpotFactor)).div(100))) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the
        reason: The external call contains '.transfer(' keyword, which matches the first characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - bonus.receiveFromGame.value(tokenCut)() ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - bank.receiveFromGame.value(address(this).balance.sub((jackpot.add(tokenCut.add(queueFunds)))))() ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['bonus.receiveFromGame.value(tokenCut)()',
    'bank.receiveFromGame.value(address(this).balance.sub((jackpot.add(tokenCut.add(queueFunds)))))()']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['bonus'] should be checked in variable bonus
        Checked variables: bonus
            Yes 1. The function name 'GAME' matches the contract name 'GAME'. This indicates that the code is a constructor.  2. There is no indication of a hardcoded
            state variable by the name 'bonus' within the provided code. Hence, characteristic 2 is not satisfied.
        There are ['bank'] should be checked in variable bank
        Checked variables: bank
            Yes 1. The function name is 'GAME', which matches the contract name given, indicating that it is a constructor.  2. The state variable 'bank' is not hardcoded
            with a specific value, but is assigned using the parameter '_ICO'. Hence only the constructor condition is satisfied.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Function Security Analysis for GAME.fillFromQueue()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function fillFromQueue.
    Check direct function security
        - function GAME.fillFromQueue() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not include any control structures that check the msg.sender against roles like Owner, Address, Leader, or CEO as specified in the
          criteria.
        - function GAME.fillFromQueue() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any 'require(xxx == True)', 'require(xxx == False)', 'require(!xxx)', or 'if(!xxx) throw' statement to check or ensure a
          condition before proceeding. Thus, it does not match any specified structure.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['__callback', 'startRaffle', '__callback', 'fillFromQueue']
        Function Security Analysis for GAME.__callback(bytes32,string,bytes)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function __callback.
            Check direct function security
                - function GAME.__callback(bytes32,string,bytes) has security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender, the function would not cause
                REE problem.
                  Reason: The 'require' statement does involve 'msg.sender' and it equates it to 'oraclize_cbAddress()', which fits the first specified structure
                  (require(msg.sender == xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO)). Thus, the previous judgment remains correct.

            There are no modifiers should be examined in function startRaffle.
            Check direct function security
                - function GAME.startRaffle(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code doesn't contain any require/assert/if statement that checks msg.sender against an owner/leader/CEO.
                - function GAME.startRaffle(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code contains a statement 'require(ticketsBought == ticketPool);' which does not match any of the specified structures where a variable is
                  set to a boolean value after a require or if statement, therefore it does not meet any of the given conditions.
            Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

                    Check direct function security
                        - function GAME.__callback(bytes32,string,bytes) has security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender, the function would not
                        cause REE problem.
                          Reason: The code contains a require statement with msg.sender compared to a function call oraclize_cbAddress(), which fits the pattern of
                          checking msg.sender against a specific address. The xxxOwner/xxxAddress pattern can include address comparisons from function calls, making the
                          initial analysis correct.

                    Check direct function security
                        - function usingOraclize.__callback(bytes32,string) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                          Reason: The function does not contain any line or structure matching the specified patterns related to msg.sender validation.
                        - function usingOraclize.__callback(bytes32,string) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                          Reason: The provided code is a function named __callback that takes two parameters: myid and result. It calls another overloaded '__callback'
                          method within itself, passing an additional parameter of 'new bytes(0)'. There is no 'require' or 'if(!xxx) throw' statements mentioned in the
                          code and hence doesn't fit any given structure.

    Analyze External Address
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            Yes The function name 'GAME' matches the contract name, indicating it is a constructor. Constructors typically initialize contracts and are executed once when
            a contract is created, not after. No state variable named 'token' is hardcoded within the function's code, making part 2 of the criteria unfulfilled. However,
            since the function matches the contract name and is thus a constructor, it satisfies the first characteristic.
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            Yes 1. The function name matches the contract name 'GAME', indicating that this function is a constructor for the contract. 2. The state variable 'token' is
            hardcoded in the function with the value AwardsTokensInterface(_BONUS).
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            Yes 1. The function is named `GAME`, which matches the name of the contract indicating that it is a constructor function.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

    The modifier of function oraclize_query are ['oraclizeAPI']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier oraclizeAPI has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier 'oraclizeAPI' does not meet any of the specified patterns for owner checks, lock mechanisms, or specific naming indicating restricted
          access like 'Onlyxxx' or 'nonReentrant'. It appears to be setting some network and address values related to 'oraclize', but does not contain any restriction or
          locking logic as per the provided criteria.
    Check direct function security
        - function usingOraclize.oraclize_query(string,bytes[],uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function provided does not include any checks using 'msg.sender' with respect to a specific owner, address, or role (like Leader/CEO) that fits the
          structural patterns described.
        - function usingOraclize.oraclize_query(string,bytes[],uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not follow any of the specified structures. There are no 'require' keyword or conditional checks that set a boolean variable to true or
          false based on the specified conditions.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['__callback', 'oraclize_newRandomDSQuery', 'startRaffle', 'oraclize_query', 'fillFromQueue', 'buyTicket', 'oraclize_query',

                REE problem.
                  Reason: The condition 'require (msg.sender == oraclize_cbAddress())' does match the structure of checking 'msg.sender' against a specific address
                  function, even though 'oraclize_cbAddress()' is a function call for a compliance check that is common in oraclize-based smart contracts.

                  role.
                - function usingOraclize.oraclize_newRandomDSQuery(uint256,uint256,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures as it does not use a variable with the required pattern of checking a condition and
                  then setting a boolean value opposite to the condition thereafter.
            Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

          Reason: The function does not contain any checks for msg.sender or any conditions related to ownership, address, leader, or CEO.
        - function GAME.getRandom() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures with the 'require' or 'if' statements, nor does it contain the variable assignment sequences
          required for the condition.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['__callback', 'forceRoll', '__callback', 'startRaffle', 'fillFromQueue', 'buyTicket']
        Function Security Analysis for GAME.__callback(bytes32,string,bytes)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function __callback.
            Check direct function security
                - function GAME.__callback(bytes32,string,bytes) has security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender, the function would not cause
                REE problem.
                  Reason: The code uses 'require (msg.sender == oraclize_cbAddress());' which satisfies the first structure as it checks if msg.sender is equal to a
                  specific address (oraclize_cbAddress()), which is similar to checking if it's xxxAddress/Owner/...
        Function Security Analysis for GAME.forceRoll()
            The modifier of function forceRoll are ['onlyOwner']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: Upon reviewing the code, the `onlyOwner` modifier contains the statement `require(msg.sender == owner)`, which directly checks that the caller
                  is the owner. This aligns with rule 1, which requires checking if only the owner or specific addresses can execute the function. No other structures
                  like lock and unlock operations are present, so rule 2 does not apply. The initial judgment of 'Yes' is based on a precise match to rule 1, without any
                  structural omissions.
        Function Security Analysis for usingOraclize.__callback(bytes32,string)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function __callback.
            Check direct function security
                - function usingOraclize.__callback(bytes32,string) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code contains a function '__callback' but there is no security check (like requiring or asserting a certain identity) based on 'msg.sender'.
                  Hence, none of the specified patterns are present.
                - function usingOraclize.__callback(bytes32,string) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code does not contain any require or if statements, nor does it modify any Boolean variables as required by the specified
                  structures.
