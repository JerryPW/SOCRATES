Start analyze function: Brave3d.buyByName(string)
Function Security Analysis for Brave3d.buyByName(string)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function buyByName.
    Check direct function security
        - function Brave3d.buyByName(string) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not include any conditional structure that specifically checks if 'msg.sender' is equal to or not equal to a specific owner, address,
          leader, or CEO. Instead, it operates based on conditions related to 'msg.value' and initializes or modifies mappings based on the input and internal mappings.
        - function Brave3d.buyByName(string) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code doesn't have the required specific variable assignment structure with 'require' or 'if-throw' statements listed in the characteristics.

Start analyze function: Brave3d.overStage(uint8)
Function Security Analysis for Brave3d.overStage(uint8)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function overStage.
    Check direct function security
        - function Brave3d.overStage(uint8) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not have any checks or assertions involving 'msg.sender'.
        - function Brave3d.overStage(uint8) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon reevaluating the code, it indeed contains `assert(!finishStage.isFinish);` which follows the `require(!xxx);` pattern. However, the subsequent `xxx
          = True;` assignment is not found immediately after this assertion. The code only has the `finishStage.isFinish = true;` statement towards the end. Therefore,
          the entire structure required by the rule is not fulfilled as the two required statements are not in sequence. This was a structural omission in the previous
          assessment.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['buyFromValue', 'buyByAddress', 'buyByName', 'withdraw', 'setName', 'forceOverStage']
        Function Security Analysis for Brave3d.buyFromValue(uint8)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function buyFromValue.
            Check direct function security
                - function Brave3d.buyFromValue(uint8) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any checks involving msg.sender comparing it to xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO using require, if-else
                  conditions, or assert statements as specified in the characteristics.
                - function Brave3d.buyFromValue(uint8) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not include any of the specified structures with the 'require' statement and the variable assignment sequences described.
