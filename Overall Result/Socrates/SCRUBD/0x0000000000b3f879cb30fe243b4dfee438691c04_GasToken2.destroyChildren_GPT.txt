    Check direct function security
        - function GasToken2.destroyChildren(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any checks or conditions involving msg.sender, let alone structuring involving msg.sender in relation to
          xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO. The function operates on internal state variables and does not incorporate access control patterns.
        - function GasToken2.destroyChildren(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not have a require statement nor an if statement with a throw which matches the specified structures.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['freeFromUpTo', 'free', 'freeFrom', 'freeUpTo']
        Function Security Analysis for GasToken2.freeFromUpTo(address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function freeFromUpTo.
            Check direct function security
                - function GasToken2.freeFromUpTo(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function checks msg.sender for allowance, not ownership or leadership, and therefore does not restrict or assert leadership or ownership
                  roles based on present criteria.
                - function GasToken2.freeFromUpTo(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The function does not contain any 'require' or 'if(!xxx) throw' statements, nor does it modify a boolean variable directly after such
                  statements. It primarily performs value checks and updates on balances and allowances without any of the specified structure.
