Function Security Analysis for BitChordCrowdsale.startOraclize(uint256)
    The modifier of function startOraclize are ['onlyOwner']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The modifier uses 'require(msg.sender == owner);', which is a code structure that enforces that only the owner can execute the function. This satisfies
          Rule 1. There are no structural omissions as I directly identified the enforcement of ownership control, which is the sole criterion for Rule 1. The structure
          does not relate to Rule 2, as there is no lock operation involved.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
