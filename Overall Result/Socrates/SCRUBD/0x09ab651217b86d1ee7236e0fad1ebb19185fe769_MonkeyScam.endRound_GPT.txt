Function Security Analysis for MonkeyScam.endRound(LDdatasets.EventReturns)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function endRound.
    Check direct function security
        - function MonkeyScam.endRound(LDdatasets.EventReturns) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not include any checks for msg.sender, which would match the specified structures (e.g., require, if, assert with msg.sender checks).
        - function MonkeyScam.endRound(LDdatasets.EventReturns) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any 'require' or 'if(!xxx) throw' statements with the corresponding variable assignments as described in the patterns. The
          available conditions using if statements are for other purposes, such as handling errors from external calls, not as boolean logic checks followed by
          assignments.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['reLoadXid', 'reLoadXaddr', 'reLoadCore', 'buyXname', 'withdraw', 'buyXaddr', 'buyCore', 'fallback', 'buyXid', 'reLoadXname']
        Function Security Analysis for MonkeyScam.reLoadXid(uint256,uint256)
            The modifier of function reLoadXid are ['isActivated', 'isHuman', 'isWithinLimits']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier isActivated has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier 'isActivated' does not explicitly show any characteristics mentioned in the rules. It does not check for a specific owner or
                  address, and it does not involve any kind of lock mechanism. The name 'isActivated' doesn't imply permission restriction based on the caller's address
                  or a lock operation.
                - modifier isHuman has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier 'isHuman' does not enforce specific owner or address check, nor does it use a reentrancy lock pattern. It only checks for non-
                  contract addresses using extcodesize.
                - modifier isWithinLimits has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier 'isWithinLimits' only checks if an amount is within a given range and does not enforce checks on the caller's identity or involve
                  lock operations. It does not fit any of the specified characteristics that would output 'Yes'.
            Check direct function security
                - function MonkeyScam.reLoadXid(uint256,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The given function code does not have any of the specified structures like checking msg.sender with xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO or
                  assert/require statements involving msg.sender.
                - function MonkeyScam.reLoadXid(uint256,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code does not contain any 'require' or 'if' statements with 'throw' that match any of the specified structures. There are neither
                  require statements setting a variable to true or false nor any conditionals that match the provided pattern.

    Analyze Gas
        - address(monkeyKing).call.value(_com)() ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - address(monkeyQueue).call.value(_queen)() ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['address(monkeyKing).call.value(_com)()', 'address(monkeyQueue).call.value(_queen)()']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['monkeyKing'] should be checked in variable monkeyKing
        Checked variables: monkeyKing
            State variable monkeyKing has initialized in public area after declaration.
        There are ['monkeyQueue'] should be checked in variable monkeyQueue
        Checked variables: monkeyQueue
            State variable monkeyQueue has initialized in public area after declaration.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
