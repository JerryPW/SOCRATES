Function Security Analysis for v1Migration.migrate(IPackFour,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function migrate.
    Check direct function security
        - function v1Migration.migrate(IPackFour,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The given function does not contain any access control logic based on msg.sender being compared to xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO by using require, if,
          or assert statements. It only contains business logic checks and operations related to migration.
        - function v1Migration.migrate(IPackFour,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code satisfies Structure 3 with require(!v1Migrated[address(pack)][id]); and v1Migrated[address(pack)][id] = true;. However, the state negation
          (v1Migrated[address(pack)][id] = true;) does not occur immediately after the require statement, as it takes place after the main logic of the function executes.
          There are several operations such as unpacking variables and processing elements before the negation is performed.

        - cards.mintCards(user,sdl.protos,sdl.qualities) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['cards.mintCards(user,sdl.protos,sdl.qualities)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['cards'] should be checked in variable cards
        Checked variables: cards
            Yes The function provided in the code is named 'constructor' which matches the typical naming convention for a constructor in Solidity. Constructors in
            Solidity are special functions used to initialize state variables like 'cards' and 'limit'. Additionally, the function is setting the state variable 'cards'
            to the input parameter '_cards', but since it's not 'hardcoded' to a specific value here, the code does not satisfy the second condition. However, since the
            function is identified as a constructor, it meets the first condition.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
