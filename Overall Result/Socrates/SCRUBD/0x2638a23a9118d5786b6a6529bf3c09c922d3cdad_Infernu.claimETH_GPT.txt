Function Security Analysis for Infernu.claimETH(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function claimETH.
    Check direct function security
        - function Infernu.claimETH(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not use any of the specified structures involving msg.sender.
        - function Infernu.claimETH(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: In the code, after `require(!_isWithdrawing);`, the negation operation `_isWithdrawing=true;` is performed immediately. However, there is a significant
          part of the main logic that executes between this and `_isWithdrawing=false;` which is intended to reset the flag. Hence, the negation operation does not
          complete immediately before the main logic of the function, even though it sets the state initially. Therefore, it does not fully meet the requirement.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['Rewards', '_taxedTransfer', 'transferFrom', 'transfer', '_transfer']
        Function Security Analysis for Infernu.Rewards()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function Rewards.
            Check direct function security
                - function Infernu.Rewards() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not include any conditional checks on 'msg.sender' related to owner or authority verification.
                - function Infernu.Rewards() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code provided does not match any of the required structures: there are no conditional checks or modifications for any variable that match
                  the criteria listed (require statement or if throw structure with a boolean variable set to both true and false).

        - _uniswapv2Router.swapExactETHForTokensSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens{value:amount}(0,path,addr,block.timestamp) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['_uniswapv2Router.swapExactETHForTokensSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens{value:amount}(0,path,addr,block.timestamp)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['_uniswapv2Router'] should be checked in variable _uniswapv2Router
        Checked variables: _uniswapv2Router
            Yes 1. The provided code is a constructor. This is evident from its presence in the constructor function, which is explicitly named 'constructor'. 2. The
            state variable '_uniswapv2Router' is assigned a hardcoded value 'IUniswapV2Router02(UniswapV2Router)' within this constructor code.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
