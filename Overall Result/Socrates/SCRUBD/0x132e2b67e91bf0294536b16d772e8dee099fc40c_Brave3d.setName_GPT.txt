Start analyze function: Brave3d.setName(string)
Function Security Analysis for Brave3d.setName(string)
    The modifier of function setName are ['isExistsOfNameAddressMap', 'isExistsOfAddressNameMap']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier isExistsOfNameAddressMap has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier `isExistsOfNameAddressMap` checks whether `_nameAddressMap[name]` is equal to 0, which does not directly enforce ownership or access
          restriction to specific addresses nor uses a lock mechanism. It also lacks naming that suggests ownership restrictions or reentrancy protection, such as
          `OnlyOwner` or `nonReentrant`.
        - modifier isExistsOfAddressNameMap has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier 'isExistsOfAddressNameMap' uses the 'require' function, but it checks if the length of bytes at _addressNameMap[msg.sender] is less than or
          equal to 0. The condition does not enforce a specific owner or address to execute the function, and there is no lock operation present. The modifier name itself
          does not imply ownership or reentrancy protection.
    Check direct function security
        - function Brave3d.setName(string) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any condition that checks or asserts the identity of msg.sender explicitly being equal or unequal to an owner or specific
          address. It lacks the structures specified in the conditions provided.
        - function Brave3d.setName(string) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: There are no require or if statements with a specific boolean variable being checked followed by an assignment to the same boolean variable.

Start analyze function: Brave3d.overStage(uint8)
Function Security Analysis for Brave3d.overStage(uint8)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function overStage.
    Check direct function security
        - function Brave3d.overStage(uint8) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not have any require, if, or assert statements that check if msg.sender is equal to or not equal to owner-type variables (like
          xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, CEO).
        - function Brave3d.overStage(uint8) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: After reviewing the code, the only relevant statement is `assert(!finishStage.isFinish);`, which matches only the first part of pattern 3
          `{require(!xxx); xxx = True;}`. However, the assignment `finishStage.isFinish = true;` comes much later and doesn't directly follow as required in the pattern.
          Thus, it cannot be considered a match for the required structure.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['withdraw', 'forceOverStage', 'buyByName', 'buyByAddress', 'setName', 'buyFromValue']
        Function Security Analysis for Brave3d.withdraw()
            The modifier of function withdraw are ['hasEarnings']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier hasEarnings has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier checks if the _valueMap[msg.sender] is greater than 0, which doesn't relate to ownership or a specific address, nor does it
                  indicate any locking operation or name pattern related to access control or reentrancy. It lacks an indicator of access control or locking feature in
                  its logic or name.
            Check direct function security
                - function Brave3d.withdraw() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures that check for msg.sender being a specific owner or address using require, if, or
                  assert statements.
                - function Brave3d.withdraw() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any 'require' statements or any pattern in which a boolean variable is checked and then subsequently modified as
                  required by the given structure. Specifically, there are no structures that involve changing the value of a boolean or equivalent statement as defined
                  in the criteria.
