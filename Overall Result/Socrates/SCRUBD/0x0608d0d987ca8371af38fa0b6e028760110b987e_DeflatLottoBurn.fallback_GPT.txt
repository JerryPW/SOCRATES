          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified patterns as there are no conditions or assertions involving msg.sender and a specific owner or address
          role (like xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO).
        - function DeflatLottoBurn.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not satisfy any of the specified structures. There are no require statements or conditional checks on a boolean variable 'xxx' followed by
          changing the value of 'xxx' as described in the checks. The require statement checks for msg.value == quota, which does not pertain to a boolean variable being
          changed. Therefore, none of the provided conditions are met.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['winner.send(amount)', 'tokenReward.transfer(burncontract,tokenReward.balanceOf(address(this)))',
    'maincontract.call.gas(200000).value(address(this).balance)()', 'tokenReward.balanceOf(address(this))']
    Analyze Transfer
        - winner.send(amount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the '.send(' keyword,
        satisfying the condition.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - tokenReward.transfer(burncontract,tokenReward.balanceOf(address(this))) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - tokenReward.transfer(burncontract,tokenReward.balanceOf(address(this))) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - The gas limit in maincontract.call.gas(200000).value(address(this).balance)() is 200000, which is too high. Therefore, it will not prevent REE problem.
        - tokenReward.balanceOf(address(this)) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['tokenReward.transfer(burncontract,tokenReward.balanceOf(address(this)))', 'maincontract.call.gas(200000).value(address(this).balance)()',
    'tokenReward.balanceOf(address(this))']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['tokenReward'] should be checked in variable tokenReward
        Checked variables: tokenReward
            State variable tokenReward has initialized in public area after declaration.
        There are ['maincontract'] should be checked in variable maincontract
        Checked variables: maincontract
            State variable maincontract has initialized in public area after declaration.
        There are ['tokenReward'] should be checked in variable tokenReward
        Checked variables: tokenReward
            State variable tokenReward has initialized in public area after declaration.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
