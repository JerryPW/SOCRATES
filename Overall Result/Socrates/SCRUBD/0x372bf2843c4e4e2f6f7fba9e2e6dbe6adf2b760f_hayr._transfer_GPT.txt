    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _transfer.
    Check direct function security
        - function hayr._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: In the given function, the condition if (msg.sender != pair) {...} checks if msg.sender is not equal to pair. The variable pair is not relevant to the
          specified conditions involving ownership or specific roles like xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO. Therefore, none of the specified structures involving checking
          or asserting msg.sender against roles such as xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO are present.
        - function hayr._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the required structures. There are 'require' statements, but their pattern does not match the prescribed conditions
          (structure 1, 2, 3 or 4) with specific variable assignments following them as described.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transferFrom', 'transfer']
        Function Security Analysis for hayr.transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transferFrom.
            Check direct function security
                - function hayr.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code checks if the allowance for the sender by the msg.sender is not equal to the maximum value, then decreases the allowance by the amount.
                  There is no structure that specifically checks for whether msg.sender is an owner, address, leader, or CEO.
                - function hayr.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not match any of the specified structures because it lacks statements like `require` or `if(!xxx) throw` which are necessary
                  conditions in the structures provided.

        - hayReflections.setShare(sender,_balances[sender]) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - hayReflections.setShare(recipient,_balances[recipient]) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['hayReflections.setShare(sender,_balances[sender])', 'hayReflections.setShare(recipient,_balances[recipient])']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['hayReflections'] should be checked in variable hayReflections
        Checked variables: hayReflections
            Yes The code provided is a constructor for the contract since the function is explicitly named 'constructor'. Constructors are special functions used to
            initialize the state of the contract when it is deployed.
        There are ['hayReflections'] should be checked in variable hayReflections
        Checked variables: hayReflections
            Yes The provided code includes a constructor function. This is evident because the function is explicitly named 'constructor', which aligns with the typical
            naming for constructor functions in Solidity smart contracts. Constructors are special functions that are executed only once when the contract is deployed and
            are responsible for initializing the contract's state variables. Additionally, the code includes initialization of the state variable 'hayReflections',
            further supporting that it is a constructor.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: hayr.swapBack()
Function Security Analysis for hayr.swapBack()
    The modifier of function swapBack are ['lockTheSwap']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier lockTheSwap is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The modifier 'lockTheSwap' does indeed match the criteria for structure 2, which requires a lock operation. The variable 'inSwapAndLiquify' is set to
          true at the beginning and reset to false at the end of the modifier, ensuring that the function is locked during execution and only entered once. Both the lock
          operation (setting to true) and the unlock operation (setting to false) are present in the code.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
