Function Security Analysis for BATMO.endRound(BATMODatasets.EventReturns)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function endRound.
    Check direct function security
        - function BATMO.endRound(BATMODatasets.EventReturns) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified patterns involving msg.sender and ownership checks.
        - function BATMO.endRound(BATMODatasets.EventReturns) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the required structures specified in the problem statement. There are no 'require' or 'if(!xxx) throw' statements
          present, and therefore no subsequent variable assignments as outlined in the potential structures.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['reLoadCore', 'withdraw', 'buyXid', 'fallback', 'reLoadXid', 'buyXaddr', 'buyCore', 'buyXname', 'reLoadXaddr', 'reLoadXname']
        Function Security Analysis for BATMO.reLoadCore(uint256,uint256,uint256,BATMODatasets.EventReturns)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function reLoadCore.
            Check direct function security
                - function BATMO.reLoadCore(uint256,uint256,uint256,BATMODatasets.EventReturns) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of
                msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not check for msg.sender to be equal or not equal to a specific owner, address, leader, or CEO.
                - function BATMO.reLoadCore(uint256,uint256,uint256,BATMODatasets.EventReturns) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures. It is mostly an event-triggering function based on round conditions, and it does not
                  have the require() or if-throw patterns followed by specific assignments described in the prompt.
            Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
            The reachable functions are ['reLoadXid', 'reLoadXaddr', 'reLoadXname']
                Function Security Analysis for BATMO.reLoadXid(uint256,uint256)
                    The modifier of function reLoadXid are ['isActivated', 'isHuman', 'isWithinLimits']
                    The result of checking modifiers:
                        - modifier isActivated has no relation with controlled by owner.
                          Reason: The modifier checks if the flag 'activated_' is set to true before allowing the function to proceed. This does not align with any of the
                          characteristics such as owner address checks or lock operations.
                        - modifier isHuman has no relation with controlled by owner.
                          Reason: The modifier is named 'isHuman' and it checks if the 'msg.sender' is equal to 'tx.origin', ensuring that the call is not from a
                          contract. While this prevents contract calls, it does not enforce ownership or specific addresses or lock mechanisms as defined by the rules.
                          None of the characteristics for ownership or lock checking from the given rules are present here.
                        - modifier isWithinLimits has no relation with controlled by owner.
                          Reason: The modifier 'isWithinLimits' only checks if a given amount of ether is within specified limits and does not include any condition on
                          the function executor, such as ownership or access control by specific addresses, nor does it involve any lock mechanism for preventing
                          reentrancy.

                        - function BATMO.reLoadXid(uint256,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                          Reason: The code does not contain any checks related to an owner or privileged address using msg.sender.
                        - function BATMO.reLoadXid(uint256,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structural patterns.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['admin2.transfer(_dev/2)', 'address(ObokContract).call.value(_OBOK.sub((_OBOK/3).mul(2)))(bytes4(keccak256()(donateDivs())))',
    'admin.transfer(_dev/2)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - admin2.transfer(_dev/2) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call 'admin2.transfer(_dev/2)'
        contains the '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - admin.transfer(_dev/2) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call 'admin.transfer(_dev/2)'
        contains the '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - address(ObokContract).call.value(_OBOK.sub((_OBOK/3).mul(2)))(bytes4(keccak256()(donateDivs()))) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['address(ObokContract).call.value(_OBOK.sub((_OBOK/3).mul(2)))(bytes4(keccak256()(donateDivs())))']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['ObokContract'] should be checked in variable ObokContract
        Checked variables: ObokContract
            Yes The function provided is named 'constructor', which explicitly indicates that it is a constructor function. According to the characteristics to be
            identified, the first rule states that a constructor function should be identified if it is explicitly named 'constructor'. Hence, the provided code satisfies
            the characteristic of being a constructor.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
