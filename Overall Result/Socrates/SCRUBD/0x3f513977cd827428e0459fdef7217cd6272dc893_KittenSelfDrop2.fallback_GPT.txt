Function Security Analysis for KittenSelfDrop2.fallback()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
    Check direct function security
        - function KittenSelfDrop2.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any require, if, or assert statements specifically checking if `msg.sender` is equal to or not equal to xxxOwner, xxxAddress,
          Leader, CEO, or similar roles.
        - function KittenSelfDrop2.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures that involve requiring a boolean condition on a variable and changing its value later
          in the function. The require statement is checking compound conditions like comparing an array value and an integer, but it does not follow any of the
          prescribed structures that involve flipping a boolean.
External Call Analysis

    Analyze Gas
        - kittenContract.balanceOf(msg.sender) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - kittenContract.transfer(msg.sender,tokensIssued) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['kittenContract.balanceOf(msg.sender)', 'kittenContract.transfer(msg.sender,tokensIssued)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['kittenContract'] should be checked in variable kittenContract
        Checked variables: kittenContract
            Yes 1) The code snippet shows a function named 'KittenSelfDrop2' which matches the name of the contract 'KittenSelfDrop2'. In Solidity, when a function has
            the same name as the contract, it is typically a constructor. Therefore, this function is determined to be a constructor.  2) The function does contain
            hardcoded values, such as 'address c = 0x2089899d03607b2192afb2567874a3f287f2f1e4', but it doesn't explicitly hardcode the state variable 'kittenContract'.
            Instead, it assigns 'KittenCoin(c)' to 'kittenContract'.  Therefore, it satisfies the first characteristic.
        There are ['kittenContract'] should be checked in variable kittenContract
        Checked variables: kittenContract
            Yes The function named 'KittenSelfDrop2' matches the contract name 'KittenSelfDrop2', indicating that this function is a constructor. According to the rules,
            if a function is a constructor, it satisfies the required characteristic.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
