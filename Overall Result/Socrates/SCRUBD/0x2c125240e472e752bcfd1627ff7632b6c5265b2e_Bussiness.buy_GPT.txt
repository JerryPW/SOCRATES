        - function Bussiness.buy(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code `require(getApproved(tokenId) == address(this));` checks if `getApproved(tokenId)` equals to `address(this)` but there is no resetting of this
          equality elsewhere in the function to imply a boolean flip. The remaining code does not follow the specified structures either.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['prices[tokenId].tokenOwner.transfer(msg.value)', 'erc721Address.transferFrom(prices[tokenId].tokenOwner,msg.sender,tokenId)']
    Analyze Transfer
