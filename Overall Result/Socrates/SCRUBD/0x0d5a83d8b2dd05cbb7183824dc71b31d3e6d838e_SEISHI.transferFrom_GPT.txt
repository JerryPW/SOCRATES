Function Security Analysis for SEISHI.transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function transferFrom.
    Check direct function security
        - function SEISHI.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not include any checks involving msg.sender compared to an owner, address, leader, or CEO for access control.
        - function SEISHI.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code checks whether the transfer amount exceeds the allowance using a require statement, but it doesn't modify the checked variable afterwards as
          required by the specified structures.

Start analyze function: SEISHI._transfer(address,address,uint256)
Function Security Analysis for SEISHI._transfer(address,address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _transfer.
    Check direct function security
        - function SEISHI._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not include any statement that checks if `msg.sender` is equal to or not equal to a specific address like xxxOwner or xxxAddress, nor does
          it involve any assert or require condition directly related to `msg.sender` in such a way.
        - function SEISHI._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures where a variable 'xxx' is checked with require or if statement and subsequently reassigned to
          a boolean value as described in the characteristics. The checks present in the code, such as 'require(tradeEnabled == false)' and 'if(tradeEnabled == false)',
          perform boolean checks but do not reassign 'tradeEnabled' to 'true', nor do they contain the full described structure.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transferFrom', 'transfer']
        Function Security Analysis for SEISHI.transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transferFrom.
            Check direct function security
                - function SEISHI.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not check for msg.sender against specific addresses like Owner, Address, Leader, or CEO, nor use assert or throw in that
                  context.
                - function SEISHI.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not satisfy any of the specified structures. The requirement mentions the usage of the 'require' keyword in combination with
                  assignment operations on the same boolean variable; however, the provided code uses 'require' to check a condition involving an amount and allowances,
                  which doesn't meet the pattern descriptions involving boolean variables.

Start analyze function: SEISHI.swapForTokenomics(uint256)
Function Security Analysis for SEISHI.swapForTokenomics(uint256)
    The modifier of function swapForTokenomics are ['lockTheSwap']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier lockTheSwap is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The modifier 'lockTheSwap' sets 'inSwapAndLiquify' to true before the function executes and resets it to false afterward. This satisfies both parts of
          the lock operation required in rule 2, ensuring the function is entered only once at a time.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
