Function Security Analysis for OpportyBountyHold.unlockTokens()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function unlockTokens.
    Check direct function security
        - function OpportyBountyHold.unlockTokens() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain checks related to specific roles or addresses like xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO.
        - function OpportyBountyHold.unlockTokens() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code contains a structure that fits pattern 3 with both required statements: `require(!holderList[msg.sender].withdrawed);` followed by
          `holderList[msg.sender].withdrawed = true;`. However, the state negation (`holderList[msg.sender].withdrawed = true;`) occurs after the main logic of the
          function (`token.transfer(msg.sender, holderList[msg.sender].tokens);`) which means it does not immediately follow and is not completed before the function's
          main logic. Hence, it does not satisfy the additional requirement.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['token.transfer(msg.sender,holderList[msg.sender].tokens)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - token.transfer(msg.sender,holderList[msg.sender].tokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - token.transfer(msg.sender,holderList[msg.sender].tokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['token.transfer(msg.sender,holderList[msg.sender].tokens)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            No The function 'setToken' is not a constructor, as the function name does not match the contract name 'OpportyBountyHold', nor is it named 'constructor'.
            Additionally, the function does not hardcode the state variable 'token'. Instead, it assigns the value based on the input parameter 'newToken'. Therefore, the
            function does not satisfy any of the given characteristics.
            Function Security Analysis for OpportyBountyHold.setToken(address)
                The modifier of function setToken are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The code contains `require(msg.sender == owner);`, which explicitly checks that only the owner can execute functions protected by this
                      modifier. This matches characteristic 1. There are no matching lock operations for characteristic 2, and as such the judgment is based entirely on
                      characteristic 1 without omissions.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
