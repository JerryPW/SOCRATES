Function Security Analysis for Swap.fallback()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
    Check direct function security
        - function Swap.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not check for the identity of the message sender against any owner or known address.
        - function Swap.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code initially requires 'check[msg.sender] == false;', however, the statement 'check[msg.sender] = true;' is executed at the end of the function,
          after all main logic and operations. This means the state negation operation doesn't immediately follow and is not completed before the main logic executes.
          Therefore, the structural requirement is not satisfied.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['msg.sender.send(msg.value)', 'beneficiary.send(msg.value)', 'swapaddress.transfer(msg.sender,amount/secondvalue)',
    'swapaddress.transfer(msg.sender,amount/thirdvalue)', 'swapaddress.transfer(msg.sender,5000000)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - msg.sender.send(msg.value) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        'msg.sender.send(msg.value)' contains the '.send(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - beneficiary.send(msg.value) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        'beneficiary.send(msg.value)' contains the '.send(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - swapaddress.transfer(msg.sender,amount/secondvalue) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - swapaddress.transfer(msg.sender,amount/thirdvalue) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - swapaddress.transfer(msg.sender,5000000) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - swapaddress.transfer(msg.sender,amount/secondvalue) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - swapaddress.transfer(msg.sender,amount/thirdvalue) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - swapaddress.transfer(msg.sender,5000000) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['swapaddress.transfer(msg.sender,amount/secondvalue)', 'swapaddress.transfer(msg.sender,amount/thirdvalue)',
    'swapaddress.transfer(msg.sender,5000000)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['swapaddress'] should be checked in variable swapaddress
        Checked variables: swapaddress
            Yes The provided code is a constructor for a contract named 'Swap'. The function is explicitly named 'constructor', which satisfies the first characteristic
            to check if the code is a constructor.
        There are ['swapaddress'] should be checked in variable swapaddress
        Checked variables: swapaddress
            Yes The function provided is named 'constructor', which matches the second part of the first characteristic indicating it is a constructor. The availability
            of a variable directly assigned within the function (e.g., 'swapaddress = ...') is not explicitly hardcoded, but the significance in this context is that the
            function's name is 'constructor'. Therefore, characteristic 1 is satisfied.
        There are ['swapaddress'] should be checked in variable swapaddress
        Checked variables: swapaddress
            Yes The code provided is a constructor of the contract because the function is explicitly named 'constructor'. Within this constructor, the state variable
            'swapaddress' is being set using the parameter 'addressOfCollectibleUsedAsReward'. Since this is a dynamic assignment to 'swapaddress' and not a hardcoded
            value, the state variable is not hardcoded. However, since the function is indeed a constructor, it satisfies the first characteristic.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
