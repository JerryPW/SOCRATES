    There are no modifiers should be examined in function sendtoRecipient.
    Check direct function security
        - function Sargasso.sendtoRecipient(uint256,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code doesn't include any of the specified conditions related to msg.sender checks, so it does not meet the criteria. It doesn't involve any
          ownership or specific address checks.
        - function Sargasso.sendtoRecipient(uint256,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures involving require statements or if(!xxx) throw statements with corresponding variable
          assignments.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['specialdeposit']
        Function Security Analysis for Sargasso.specialdeposit(uint256,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function specialdeposit.
            Check direct function security
                - function Sargasso.specialdeposit(uint256,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code requires that the function caller doesn't have a lock, but doesn't specifically check or enforce any ownership role using msg.sender
                  against Owner/Address/Leader/CEO variables or roles.
                - function Sargasso.specialdeposit(uint256,uint256) has security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The code contains the structure 'require(userLock[msg.sender] == false); userLock[msg.sender] = true;' which matches Structure 2. The negation
                  from false to true using 'userLock[msg.sender]' is done immediately after the require statement and before the main logic of the function executes.
                  Hence, the code satisfies the requirement.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
