Function Security Analysis for HeroLedger.collect(uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function collect.
    Check direct function security
        - function HeroLedger.collect(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified statements checking explicitly if msg.sender is an owner, address, leader, or CEO in the ways described.
        - function HeroLedger.collect(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code contains a require statement to check if ownerIndexToERC20Balance[msg.sender] is greater than or equal to amount, but there is no following
          assignment of ownerIndexToERC20Balance[msg.sender] or anything analogous to the conditions required. There is also no require statement with a condition of a
          boolean variable directly set followed by setting it to its opposite value.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['erc20.transfer(msg.sender,amount)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - erc20.transfer(msg.sender,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - erc20.transfer(msg.sender,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['erc20.transfer(msg.sender,amount)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['erc20'] should be checked in variable erc20
        Checked variables: erc20
            No The function provided in the code is called 'setERC20Address', which neither matches the contract name 'HeroLedger' nor is it named 'constructor'.
            Additionally, the state variable 'erc20' is not hardcoded in the function; instead, it is assigned a value based on an external input. Hence, neither of the
            specified conditions are satisfied.
            Function Security Analysis for HeroLedger.setERC20Address(address,uint256,uint256)
                The modifier of function setERC20Address are ['onlyLeader']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyLeader is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The modifier enforces that only the address stored in 'leaderAddress' can execute the function, as evident from the statement
                      'require(msg.sender == leaderAddress);'. This satisfies characteristic 1.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
