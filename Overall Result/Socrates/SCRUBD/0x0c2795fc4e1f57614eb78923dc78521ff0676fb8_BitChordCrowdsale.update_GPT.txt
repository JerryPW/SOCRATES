    Check direct function security
        - function BitChordCrowdsale.update() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not have any condition or assertion related to 'msg.sender' being equal to or different from 'xxxOwner', 'xxxAddress', 'Leader', or
          'CEO'. It involves an oracle query and subtraction but no access control check based on the call origin address.
        - function BitChordCrowdsale.update() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not contain any 'require' or 'if' statements that involve setting a variable to True or False as specified in the defined patterns.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

Start analyze function: usingOraclize.oraclize_query(uint256,string,string)
Function Security Analysis for usingOraclize.oraclize_query(uint256,string,string)
    The modifier of function oraclize_query are ['oraclizeAPI']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier oraclizeAPI has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier `oraclizeAPI` does not enforce any ownership constraint nor does it perform any lock operation. It is mainly setting or updating the
          `OraclizeI` address. There is no check for specific ownership or reentrancy protection, and the function name `oraclizeAPI` does not imply such characteristics.
    Check direct function security
        - function usingOraclize.oraclize_query(uint256,string,string) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures related to msg.sender equality or inequality checks with an owner-like entity.
        - function usingOraclize.oraclize_query(uint256,string,string) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not have any of the specified structures such as 'require(xxx == True); xxx = False;' or 'if(!xxx) throw; xxx = true;'. There are no
          require statements or logical negations that set and subsequently update a boolean variable. The function only checks for a price condition and returns values
          based on that.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

            There are no modifiers should be examined in function __callback.
            Check direct function security
                - function BitChordCrowdsale.__callback(bytes32,string,bytes) has security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender, the function would
                not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The code contains the statement 'require(msg.sender == oraclize_cbAddress());' which matches the structure of characteristic 1, as
                  'oraclize_cbAddress()' is not a local variable and it checks if msg.sender is equal to a specific address returned by 'oraclize_cbAddress()'.

                - function BitChordCrowdsale.update() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function update() does not contain any of the four specified structures that check the msg.sender against a specific role or address, such
                  as xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO.
                - function BitChordCrowdsale.update() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified require or if structures that involve setting a variable to true or false after a condition.

        There are ['oraclize'] should be checked in variable oraclize
        Checked variables: oraclize
            Yes The function is named 'BitChordCrowdsale', which matches the name of the contract 'BitChordCrowdsale'. This match suggests that the function is the
            constructor of the contract. Constructors are special types of functions used to initialize contracts and are executed once upon deployment. Hence, the
            function satisfies the first characteristic of being a constructor.
        There are ['oraclize'] should be checked in variable oraclize
        Checked variables: oraclize
            Yes The function name 'BitChordCrowdsale' matches the contract name 'BitChordCrowdsale', indicating this is a constructor function. Constructors in Solidity
            do not need to be explicitly defined as 'constructor' but can simply use the contract's name as the function name. Therefore, this satisfies the first
            characteristic.
