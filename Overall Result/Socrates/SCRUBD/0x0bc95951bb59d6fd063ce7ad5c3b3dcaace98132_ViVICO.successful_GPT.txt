Function Security Analysis for ViVICO.successful()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function successful.
    Check direct function security
        - function ViVICO.successful() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The given code lacks any messaging about ownership (msg.sender) verification or a role-based requirement.
        - function ViVICO.successful() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does have the structure of `require(xxx == True);`, corresponding to `require(state == State.Successful);`. However, it does not include the
          statement `state = False;`. Without both the required statements in the structure one, it doesn't match the full pattern described. The structure requires both
          statements present.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['tokenReward.transfer(creator,remanent)', 'tokenReward.balanceOf(this)', 'creator.transfer(address(this).balance)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - tokenReward.transfer(creator,remanent) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - creator.transfer(address(this).balance) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        'creator.transfer(address(this).balance)' contains '.transfer('.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - tokenReward.transfer(creator,remanent) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - tokenReward.balanceOf(this) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['tokenReward.transfer(creator,remanent)', 'tokenReward.balanceOf(this)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['tokenReward'] should be checked in variable tokenReward
        Checked variables: tokenReward
            Yes The provided code contains a function explicitly named 'constructor', which is a clear indication that it is a constructor function. This satisfies the
            first characteristic.
        There are ['tokenReward'] should be checked in variable tokenReward
        Checked variables: tokenReward
            Yes The function in the provided code snippet is explicitly named 'constructor'.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
