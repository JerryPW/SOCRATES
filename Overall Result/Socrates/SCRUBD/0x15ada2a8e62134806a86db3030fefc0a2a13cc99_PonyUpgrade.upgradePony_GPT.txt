Function Security Analysis for PonyUpgrade.upgradePony(uint256,uint256,bytes)
    The modifier of function upgradePony are ['whenNotPaused']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier whenNotPaused has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier 'whenNotPaused' does not enforce ownership checks, nor does it implement a lock mechanism related to reentrancy protection. It doesn't fit
          any of the criteria outlined in the rules.
    Check direct function security
        - function PonyUpgrade.upgradePony(uint256,uint256,bytes) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not have any checks involving compare msg.sender to an owner or privileged address like xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO.
        - function PonyUpgrade.upgradePony(uint256,uint256,bytes) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not contain any require statement that changes or validates a boolean within the specified structures. It only checks conditions
          related to ownership and IDs, without altering any boolean variables directly after such a check.

    Analyze External Address
        There are ['geneScience'] should be checked in variable geneScience
        Checked variables: geneScience
            No The function 'setGeneScienceAddress' does not satisfy any of the specified characteristics. It is not a constructor, as it does not share the name with the
            contract 'PonyUpgrade' and is not explicitly named 'constructor'. Additionally, the function does not contain any hardcoded state variables; it simply sets
            'geneScience' using an external address without any hardcoded values.
            Function Security Analysis for PonyBreeding.setGeneScienceAddress(address)
                The modifier of function setGeneScienceAddress are ['onlyCEO']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyCEO is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The usage of 'require(msg.sender == ceoAddress);' clearly restricts the execution of functions using this modifier to only the CEO. This
                      directly corresponds to rule 1, where the code enforces that only specific addresses can execute the function. There are no indications of a lock
                      operation, thus no structural omissions based on the provided code.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
