Start analyze function: Dice.__callback(bytes32,string)
Function Security Analysis for Dice.__callback(bytes32,string)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function __callback.
    Check direct function security
        - function Dice.__callback(bytes32,string) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: Though the code contains `require(msg.sender == oraclize_cb);`, `oraclize_cb` is assigned by calling `oraclize_cbAddress()` and is not a local,
          contract-level variable of type Owner/Address/Leader/CEO. Therefore, it does not satisfy the condition where the check should involve a variable directly named
          as such owners or addresses.
        - function Dice.__callback(bytes32,string) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code uses a `require` statement to check `msg.sender == oraclize_cb` and updates a boolean flag `playerWins` inside the function, but this does not
          fall into any of the specified patterns. There are no negation checks or flag toggling that matches the required patterns.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['address(player).transfer(winAmount)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - address(player).transfer(winAmount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the
        '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: usingOraclize.oraclize_cbAddress()
Function Security Analysis for usingOraclize.oraclize_cbAddress()
    The modifier of function oraclize_cbAddress are ['oraclizeAPI']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier oraclizeAPI has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier does not enforce ownership checks, nor does it implement any lock operations. It also doesn't suggest any ownership or locking based on its
          name.
    Check direct function security
        - function usingOraclize.oraclize_cbAddress() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any conditions or assertions with msg.sender related to specific owner, leader, or CEO addresses.
        - function usingOraclize.oraclize_cbAddress() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code doesn't contain any of the specified structures: there are no 'require' or 'if' statements with conditions on a variable, nor
          assignments changing the variable's state as outlined in the criteria.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['__callback']
        Function Security Analysis for Dice.__callback(bytes32,string)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function __callback.
            Check direct function security
                - function Dice.__callback(bytes32,string) has security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender, the function would not cause REE
                problem.
                  Reason: The code contains 'require(msg.sender == oraclize_cb);'. Even though 'oraclize_cb' is guided by a local variable oraclize_cb, it is checking the
                  address against msg.sender, which matches structure 1.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
