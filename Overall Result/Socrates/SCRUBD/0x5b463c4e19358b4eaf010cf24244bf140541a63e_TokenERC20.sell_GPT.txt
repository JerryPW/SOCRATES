    Check direct function security
        - function TokenERC20.sell(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function checks if the sender has enough tokens to sell, but it does not check if the sender is a specific owner/leader or require them to be, which
          does not match any of the outlined structures.
        - function TokenERC20.sell(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: Upon reevaluation, the code contains an 'if (balanceOf[msg.sender] < amount) throw;' statement, which matches the first part of the fourth structure.
          However, there is no subsequent 'xxx = true;' statement relating to the same variable (balanceOf[msg.sender]). Therefore, it does not fully match any of the
          specified structures.
