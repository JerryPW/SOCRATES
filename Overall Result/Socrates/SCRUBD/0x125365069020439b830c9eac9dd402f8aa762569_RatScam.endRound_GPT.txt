          indicates internal access, but doesn't involve msg.sender checks relevant to the specified patterns.
        - function RatScam.endRound(RSdatasets.EventReturns) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided Smart Contract code does not contain any of the required structures involving require() or if() statements as described.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

        Function Security Analysis for RatScam.withdraw()
            The modifier of function withdraw are ['isActivated', 'isHuman']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier isActivated has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier checks a state variable 'activated_' to determine if it's true, but doesn't enforce ownership or a lock mechanism. It doesn't
                  fulfil any of the specified conditions.
                - modifier isHuman has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier enforces that only externally owned accounts (not contracts) can execute the function. This does not match any of the specific
                  characteristics, since it doesn't check for a specific owner or a locking mechanism, nor does it have a name suggesting such a mechanism.

                  Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified patterns related to permission checks with msg.sender for specific roles such as
                  xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO.
                - function RatScam.withdraw() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures. There are no `require(!xxx)`, `require(xxx == True)`, `require(xxx == False)`, or
                  `if(!xxx) throw` conditions followed by an assignment to the same variable inside the function provided.
