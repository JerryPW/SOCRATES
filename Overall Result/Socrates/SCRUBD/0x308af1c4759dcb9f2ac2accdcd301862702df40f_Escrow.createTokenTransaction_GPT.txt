Function Security Analysis for Escrow.createTokenTransaction(address,uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256,address,uint256)
    The modifier of function createTokenTransaction are ['onlyAllowed']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier onlyAllowed is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The code within the onlyAllowed modifier uses the require statement to check if msg.sender is either the owner or a specific address from
          eternal.getAddress(0). This aligns perfectly with characteristic 1, where access control is enforced by checking the caller against specific authorized
          addresses. There are no indications of any locking mechanism or protection against reentrancy, and only the presence of owner/address checking satisfies one of
          the listed characteristics, fitting the conditions for a 'Yes' judgment. Thus, the judgment as 'Yes' was made correctly based purely on the access control logic
          implemented in this modifier.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
