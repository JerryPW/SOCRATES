Function Security Analysis for TopInvest125.fallback()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
    Check direct function security
        - function TopInvest125.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code doesn't have any checks against specific roles like xxxOwner or Leader involving 'msg.sender'. It deals with sender in terms of processing
          deposits.
        - function TopInvest125.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not include any of the defined structures. There are no require statements checking a boolean variable for True or False and then altering
          it, nor are there any if conditions followed by a throw dealing with boolean variables. Instead, it checks conditions related to gas and Ether values, which do
          not fit the prescribed patterns.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['PROMO.send(promo)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - PROMO.send(promo) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the '.send(' keyword..
        Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Function Security Analysis for TopInvest125.pay()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function pay.
    Check direct function security
        - function TopInvest125.pay() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any statements that explicitly check if the sender of the message (msg.sender) is equal to or not equal to a specific owner or
          address using 'require', 'if', or 'assert' statements as described in the characteristics. It operates on financial state transitions without sender-specific
          checks.
        - function TopInvest125.pay() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code contains a loop for processing payments to investors, checking conditions related to available contract money and gas, but does not
          include any of the specified patterns of `require` or `if` statements with explicit checks for a boolean variable being true or false followed by setting that
          variable to the opposite. Hence, none of the defined structures are present in this code.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['fallback']
        Function Security Analysis for TopInvest125.fallback()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
            Check direct function security
                - function TopInvest125.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code only uses 'msg.sender' to track the sender's address for value deposits and does not enforce any ownership logic based on 'msg.sender'.
                  There are no conditions checking against specific owner, address, leader, or CEO roles for any type of access control.
                - function TopInvest125.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The given code does not have any structures that match the specified patterns. The code only contains condition checks and operations related to
                  investments and payments like adding to a queue, sending some promotional amount, and making payments. There are no structures involving changing a
                  variable's value that are pre-conditioned by a 'require' statement specifically checking its boolean state or designated conditions followed by changes
                  to that variable as described in any of the characteristic structures.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['dep.depositor.send(money)', 'dep.depositor.send(dep.expect)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - dep.depositor.send(money) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains '.send('
        keyword, thus satisfying the rule.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - dep.depositor.send(dep.expect) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains '.send('
        keyword, thus satisfying the rule.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
