Function Security Analysis for VotingChallenge.sendReward(address)
    The modifier of function sendReward are ['afterVotingPeriod']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier afterVotingPeriod has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier checks if the variable 'isVotingPeriod' is false to allow execution of the function, which does not match any of the specified
          characteristics related to ownership or reentrancy locks. It does not satisfy any of the characteristics outlined.
    Check direct function security
        - function VotingChallenge.sendReward(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not have any of the required structures such as a check using require, if conditional with msg.sender checking or assert involving
          msg.sender.
        - function VotingChallenge.sendReward(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not implement a structure matching any of the provided patterns. There are no 'require' statements or direct logical checks that are
          followed by setting the same variable to True or False as described in the patterns.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['to.transfer(reward+voters[to].fullVotes[winner])', 'forwarder.forward.value(sum)(referrer1,to)', 'forwarder.forward.value(sum)(referrer2,to)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - to.transfer(reward+voters[to].fullVotes[winner]) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        contains '.transfer(', therefore it satisfies the characteristic of containing '.transfer('.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - forwarder.forward.value(sum)(referrer1,to) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - forwarder.forward.value(sum)(referrer2,to) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['forwarder.forward.value(sum)(referrer1,to)', 'forwarder.forward.value(sum)(referrer2,to)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['forwarder'] should be checked in variable forwarder
        Checked variables: forwarder
            Yes The function is a constructor because it has the same name as the contract, VotingChallenge, and it explicitly uses the word 'constructor'. Thus, it
            satisfies the first characteristic.
        There are ['forwarder'] should be checked in variable forwarder
        Checked variables: forwarder
            Yes The provided code is a constructor because it does not have a separate function name and is defined with the 'constructor' keyword. Therefore, it
            satisfies the first characteristic.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
