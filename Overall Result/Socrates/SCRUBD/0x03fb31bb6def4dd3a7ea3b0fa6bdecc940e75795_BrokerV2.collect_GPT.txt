Function Security Analysis for BrokerV2.collect(uint256,address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function collect.
    Check direct function security
        - function BrokerV2.collect(uint256,address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code checks for 'msg.sender' in multiple instances but none match the specified patterns involving permission checks against an owner or equivalent
          role.
        - function BrokerV2.collect(uint256,address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not meet any of the specified structures: there are no variable requirement statements followed by immediate state toggling within the
          context of the described characteristics. Specifically, the code contains a requirement check for the auction closing time and conditional logic for payments,
          but this does not fit the required pattern of checking a boolean variable and immediately setting it to the opposite value.

    Analyze Transfer
        - erc20Token.transfer(lastOwner2,lastOwner_funds) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - creator.transfer(royality) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains '.transfer('
        keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - lastOwner2.transfer(lastOwner_funds) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains
        '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - erc20Token.transfer(creator,royality) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - Token.safeTransferFrom(Token.ownerOf(tokenID),_auction.highestBidder,tokenID) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - erc20Token.transfer(lastOwner2,lastOwner_funds) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - erc20Token.transfer(creator,royality) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['Token.safeTransferFrom(Token.ownerOf(tokenID),_auction.highestBidder,tokenID)', 'erc20Token.transfer(lastOwner2,lastOwner_funds)',
    'erc20Token.transfer(creator,royality)']
    Analyze External Address
        The variable 'Token' in external call 'Token.safeTransferFrom(Token.ownerOf(tokenID),_auction.highestBidder,tokenID)' has no state variable assigned. Therefore we
        check whether it has been hardcoded in the function.
            No The variable Token is not hardcoded. It is instantiated using the parameter _mintableToken passed to the function, which indicates that its value is
            dynamic and not fixed within the code. The function uses this parameter to interact with the IMintableToken interface corresponding to the provided
            _mintableToken address.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
