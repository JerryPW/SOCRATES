Function Security Analysis for XYZProtocol._beforeTokenTransfer(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _beforeTokenTransfer.
    Check direct function security
        - function XYZProtocol._beforeTokenTransfer(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function is checking if the recipient is equal to 'pair', but it does not involve 'msg.sender'. Also, 'msg.sender' is not being compared against
          'Owner', 'Address', 'Leader', or 'CEO'.
        - function XYZProtocol._beforeTokenTransfer(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code contains 'if (!isInPresale)', but it lacks a 'isInPresale = true' statement or similar structure required by one of the specified patterns for
          a positive match.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transfer', '_transfer', 'transferFrom']
        Function Security Analysis for XYZProtocol.transfer(address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transfer.
            Check direct function security
                - function XYZProtocol.transfer(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not perform any checks related to msg.sender against xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO. It only calls another function
                  _transfer with _msgSender(), recipient, and amount as arguments.
                - function XYZProtocol.transfer(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code doesn't contain any `require` statement or conditional statement related to a variable `xxx`, nor any assignment to a boolean variable.
                  It only calls a function and returns `true`. It doesn't match any of the required structures.

Start analyze function: XYZProtocol.swapBack()
Function Security Analysis for XYZProtocol.swapBack()
    The modifier of function swapBack are ['nonReentrant']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier nonReentrant is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The modifier 'nonReentrant' enforces a lock operation by setting '_status' to '_ENTERED' initially to prevent reentrancy attacks and resets it back to
          '_NOT_ENTERED' at the end of the function. This matches structure 2, where a flag is used to ensure the function enters only once, thereby not overlooking any
          parts of the structure.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
