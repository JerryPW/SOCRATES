Function Security Analysis for InstaDice.payoutPreviousRoll()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function payoutPreviousRoll.
    Check direct function security
        - function InstaDice.payoutPreviousRoll() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any patterns that match the specified structures related to checking msg.sender against specific roles like xxxOwner,
          xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO.
        - function InstaDice.payoutPreviousRoll() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not initialize any variable with require or if statement in the patterns mentioned, nor does it set a boolean variable to true or false as
          depicted in the demanded pattern. It checks specific conditions with require statements but does not satisfy the sequence and condition requirement exactly as
          outlined.

Function Security Analysis for InstaDice._finalizePreviousRoll(InstaDice.User,InstaDice.Stats)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _finalizePreviousRoll.
    Check direct function security
        - function InstaDice._finalizePreviousRoll(InstaDice.User,InstaDice.Stats) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function lacks msg.sender characteristic patterns linked to verification against xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
        - function InstaDice._finalizePreviousRoll(InstaDice.User,InstaDice.Stats) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not have a structure that matches any of the specified patterns in the prompt. The conditions in the code are used for assertion and
          require statements with different logic, but the pattern emphasized in the prompt requires specific sequence of setting boolean values after conditional
          requirements or assertions, which this code lacks.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['roll', 'payoutPreviousRoll']
        Function Security Analysis for InstaDice.roll(uint8)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function roll.
            Check direct function security
                - function InstaDice.roll(uint8) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not include information about msg.sender being compared against xxxOwner or similar.
                - function InstaDice.roll(uint8) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The given code does not contain any required patterns of 'require' or 'if' with the specified conditions and variable manipulations as mentioned
                  in the criteria.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['msg.sender.call.value(_user.r_payout)()']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - msg.sender.call.value(_user.r_payout)() ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['msg.sender.call.value(_user.r_payout)()']
    Analyze External Address
        External call msg.sender.call.value(_user.r_payout)() calls msg.sender, which consider potential REE problem.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
