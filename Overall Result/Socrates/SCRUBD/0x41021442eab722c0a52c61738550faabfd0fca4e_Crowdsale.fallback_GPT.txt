Function Security Analysis for Crowdsale.fallback()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
    Check direct function security
        - function Crowdsale.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any checks or assertions involving msg.sender being a specific owner or leader role.
        - function Crowdsale.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code snippet contains a 'require(!crowdsaleClosed && msg.value >= 1 ether);' statement which is a variation of structure 3 but doesn't fully match
          because there's no subsequent setting of `crowdsaleClosed` to `True`. So, none of the required structures is matched completely.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,sendTokens)', 'beneficiary.send(amount)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,sendTokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - beneficiary.send(amount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the '.send('
        keyword, which satisfies the second condition.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,sendTokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender,sendTokens)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['tokenReward'] should be checked in variable tokenReward
        Checked variables: tokenReward
            Yes The function in the provided code snippet is named 'Crowdsale', which matches the contract name, 'Crowdsale', indicating that it is the constructor of the
            contract. Additionally, the state variable 'tokenReward' is being hardcoded with the value returned by 'token(0x12AC8d8F0F48b7954bcdA736AF0576a12Dc8C387)'.
            Thus, the function satisfies both Constructor detection and state variable hardcoding.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
