    The modifier of function launch are ['onlyOwner']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The code uses 'require(_owner == _msgSender())' to restrict function execution to the owner, which aligns with rule 1 (check whether the code enforces
          only the owner can execute the function). There is no need to match structure 2 as structure 1 is already satisfied.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
