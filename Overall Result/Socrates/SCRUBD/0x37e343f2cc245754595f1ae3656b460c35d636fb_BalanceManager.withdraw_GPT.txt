    There are no modifiers should be examined in function withdraw.
    Check direct function security
        - function BalanceManager.withdraw(uint64) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code checks conditions based on the balances and whether a user has an account, but does not include any of the specified structural checks for
          msg.sender against some kind of specific ownership or leadership variable.
        - function BalanceManager.withdraw(uint64) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.

        - gameToken.transfer(msg.sender,_amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - gameToken.transfer(msg.sender,_amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['gameToken.transfer(msg.sender,_amount)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['gameToken'] should be checked in variable gameToken
        Checked variables: gameToken
            Yes 1. The function 'constructor' is explicitly named 'constructor', which satisfies the first characteristic of being a constructor. 2. The function sets the
            state variable 'gameToken' by assigning it the result of the external call "ERC223(_gameTokenAddress)", where '_gameTokenAddress' is a parameter rather than a
            hardcoded value. Thus, it does not satisfy the second characteristic of hardcoding the state variable.  Therefore, the function satisfies the first
            characteristic.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
