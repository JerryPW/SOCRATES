Function Security Analysis for CharityMiner.deposit(uint8)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function deposit.
    Check direct function security
        - function CharityMiner.deposit(uint8) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The given code uses the 'require' statement but does not match any of the specified patterns regarding msg.sender and owner or leader addresses.
        - function CharityMiner.deposit(uint8) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code checks if the function has a structure where a variable's value is conditioned with a requirement. In this code, there is no 'require(xxx ==
          True)', 'require(xxx == False)', 'require(!xxx)', or 'if(!xxx) throw;', followed by assignments to the same variable outside of the condition checks. Even
          though there's a 'require(!paused)', the pattern of setting 'paused = True/False' afterwards is not present inside this function.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['p3d.buy.value(purchase)(msg.sender)', 'charityAddress.transfer(donation)', 'p3d.withdraw()']
    Analyze Transfer
        - charityAddress.transfer(donation) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call contains the '.transfer('
        keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - p3d.buy.value(purchase)(msg.sender) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - p3d.withdraw() ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['p3d.buy.value(purchase)(msg.sender)', 'p3d.withdraw()']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['p3d'] should be checked in variable p3d
        Checked variables: p3d
            Yes The provided code is a constructor because the function is explicitly named 'constructor'. Constructors are executed once when the contract is deployed,
            and do not have a function name matching the contract name.  Additionally, the code initializes the state variable 'p3d'. The assignment 'p3d = POWH(powh);'
            suggests it is setting 'p3d' based on the passed constructor parameter 'powh', but there is no evidence of the variable being hardcoded. Therefore, the
            hardcoded condition doesn't apply here. Based on the constructor criteria being met, 'Yes' is returned.
        There are ['p3d'] should be checked in variable p3d
        Checked variables: p3d
            Yes The code provided is a constructor as it is named 'constructor'. This matches with one of the characteristics to output 'Yes'.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: CharityMiner.myDividends()
Function Security Analysis for CharityMiner.myDividends()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function myDividends.
    Check direct function security
        - function CharityMiner.myDividends() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any checks or assertions on msg.sender.
        - function CharityMiner.myDividends() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not have any of the specified structures. There are no conditional statements or assignments to a boolean variable as required by the
          conditions.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['p3d.myDividends(true)']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - p3d.myDividends(true) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['p3d.myDividends(true)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['p3d'] should be checked in variable p3d
        Checked variables: p3d
            Yes The provided code is a constructor, as the function is explicitly named 'constructor'.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: CharityMiner.myTokens()
Function Security Analysis for CharityMiner.myTokens()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function myTokens.
    Check direct function security
        - function CharityMiner.myTokens() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not involve checking the identity of the msg.sender against any owner or specific authority role within its logic.
        - function CharityMiner.myTokens() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not have any 'require' statements or conditional throwing related to a boolean variable being set to True or False. The function
          simply returns a value from another function without fulfilling any of the specified structures.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['p3d.myTokens()']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - p3d.myTokens() ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['p3d.myTokens()']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['p3d'] should be checked in variable p3d
        Checked variables: p3d
            Yes The function is explicitly named 'constructor', which matches the typical naming for a constructor function in Solidity.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
