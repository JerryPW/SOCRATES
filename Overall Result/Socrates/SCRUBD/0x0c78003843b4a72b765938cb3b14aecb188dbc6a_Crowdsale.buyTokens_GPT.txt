Start analyze function: Crowdsale.buyTokens(address)
Function Security Analysis for Crowdsale.buyTokens(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function buyTokens.
    Check direct function security
        - function Crowdsale.buyTokens(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not have any conditionals or assertions guarding access based on `msg.sender`. None of the specified patterns are present in this
          piece of code.
        - function Crowdsale.buyTokens(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain require statements or conditional checks of the types specified in the characteristics.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['msg.sender.transfer(_diff)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - msg.sender.transfer(_diff) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains '.transfer('
        keyword, thus it satisfies the first characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: Crowdsale._processPurchase(address,uint256)
Function Security Analysis for Crowdsale._processPurchase(address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _processPurchase.
    Check direct function security
        - function Crowdsale._processPurchase(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any checks or assertions that involve 'msg.sender == xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO' or similar structures. It only
          calls a function to deliver tokens without any conditions related to msg.sender.
        - function Crowdsale._processPurchase(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code snippet provided does not contain any of the required conditional structures that involve logical checking or modifying a boolean variable
          named xxx. Therefore, it does not fit any of the given patterns.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['fallback', 'manualSale', 'buyTokens']
        Function Security Analysis for Crowdsale.fallback()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
            Check direct function security
                - function Crowdsale.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code snippet does not involve any checks related to msg.sender against an owner-like address, nor does it perform assert or require
                  operations for sender verification. Therefore, it does not match any of the given characteristics.
                - function Crowdsale.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code provided consists of a function that calls another function `buyTokens` with `msg.sender` as a parameter. There are no `require`
                  statements checking a boolean variable or modifying a boolean variable's state as outlined in the specified structures.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: []
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: Crowdsale._deliverTokens(address,uint256)
Function Security Analysis for Crowdsale._deliverTokens(address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _deliverTokens.
    Check direct function security
        - function Crowdsale._deliverTokens(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures that involve checking the msg.sender against an xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
        - function Crowdsale._deliverTokens(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided function does not contain any of the specified structures. It neither has 'require' or 'if' statements, nor does it manipulate any boolean
          variable named 'xxx'.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['fallback', '_processPurchase', 'manualSale', 'buyTokens']
        Function Security Analysis for Crowdsale.fallback()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
            Check direct function security
                - function Crowdsale.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The provided function does not contain any checks or conditions involving `msg.sender` that match the specified patterns for msg.sender checks.
                - function Crowdsale.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code provided does not contain any of the specified structures. It doesn't include a 'require' statement or an 'if' condition related to a
                  boolean variable that is toggled between true and false.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['token.safeOwnerTransfer(_beneficiary,_tokenAmount)']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - token.safeOwnerTransfer(_beneficiary,_tokenAmount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['token.safeOwnerTransfer(_beneficiary,_tokenAmount)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            Yes The function provided in the code is a constructor because its name is explicitly 'constructor'. This matches one of the characteristics that satisfies
            the condition.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
