Function Security Analysis for bebBUYtwo.DayQuKuanUsdt()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function DayQuKuanUsdt.
    Check direct function security
        - function bebBUYtwo.DayQuKuanUsdt() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not include any checks or assertions directly involving msg.sender being equal to or not equal to a specific owner, address, leader,
          or CEO. It only works with the user's storage data and general conditions, without access control based on msg.sender.
        - function bebBUYtwo.DayQuKuanUsdt() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not exhibit any of the defined structures as it lacks a require statement followed by a variable assignment that toggles the same
          variable.

    Analyze External Address
        There are ['bebTokenTransfer'] should be checked in variable bebTokenTransfer
        Checked variables: bebTokenTransfer
            Yes The provided code snippet contains a function named 'bebBUYtwo'. This function does not match the contract name 'bebBUYtwo' or is not explicitly named
            'constructor', indicating it is not a constructor. However, the function does hardcode several state variables, like 'bebethex', 'decimals', 'BEBday',
            'bebjiage', 'bebtime', and 'usdtex'. This means it satisfies the second characteristic of having hardcoded state variables.
        There are ['bebTokenTransferUSDT'] should be checked in variable bebTokenTransferUSDT
        Checked variables: bebTokenTransferUSDT
            Yes 1. The function name "bebBUYtwo" matches the contract name "bebBUYtwo". This indicates that the function is likely a constructor according to the
            characteristic rule that checks if the function name matches the contract name.  2. Additionally, the function hardcodes the state variable
            "bebTokenTransferUSDT" with the value returned by "tokenTransferUSDT(_usdtadderss)" function, satisfying the second characteristic of hardcoding the provided
            state variable.
        There are ['bebTokenTransfer'] should be checked in variable bebTokenTransfer
        Checked variables: bebTokenTransfer
            Yes The function name 'bebBUYtwo' matches the contract name 'bebBUYtwo', indicating that this function acts as a constructor. Constructors are special
            functions that are executed during the deployment of a contract and typically initialize state variables. Since the function name matches the contract name,
            it satisfies the first characteristic.
        There are ['bebTokenTransfer'] should be checked in variable bebTokenTransfer
        Checked variables: bebTokenTransfer
            Yes The function name 'bebBUYtwo' matches the contract name 'bebBUYtwo', which is one of the characteristics for a constructor.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
