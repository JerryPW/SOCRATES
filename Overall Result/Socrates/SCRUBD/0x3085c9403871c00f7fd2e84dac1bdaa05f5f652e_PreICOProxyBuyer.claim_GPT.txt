        There are ['crowdsale'] should be checked in variable crowdsale
        Checked variables: crowdsale
            No The function `setCrowdsale` does not match the name of the contract `PreICOProxyBuyer` nor is it explicitly named 'constructor', so it is not a
            constructor. Additionally, it assigns the input parameter `_crowdsale` to the state variable `crowdsale`, rather than hardcoding a specific value.

                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: Upon rechecking, the code 'if (msg.sender != owner) throw;' enforces that only the owner can execute the function. This clearly matches rule
                      1, which focuses on owner or specific address enforcement.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
