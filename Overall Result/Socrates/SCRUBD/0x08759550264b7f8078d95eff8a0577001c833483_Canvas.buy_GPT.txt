Function Security Analysis for Canvas.buy()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function buy.
    Check direct function security
        - function Canvas.buy() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not have any conditional checks or assertions related to msg.sender being compared with xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
        - function Canvas.buy() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not follow any of the specified structures.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['hodler.call{gas:20000,value:hodler_share}()']
    Analyze Transfer
    Analyze Gas
        - The gas limit in hodler.call{gas:20000,value:hodler_share}() is 20000, which is too high. Therefore, it will not prevent REE problem.
    Remaining external call: ['hodler.call{gas:20000,value:hodler_share}()']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['hodler'] should be checked in variable hodler
        Checked variables: hodler
            No The given code snippet represents a function named 'buy'. This function is not a constructor because its name is 'buy', which does not match the contract
            name 'Canvas', nor is it explicitly named 'constructor'.   Additionally, the function does not hardcode the state variable 'hodler'. In the provided code, the
            'hodler' variable is used dynamically in the calculation of 'hodler_share' and in a conditional statement, but it is not directly assigned a fixed value
            within the function. It calls the 'hodler' address with some calculated value, but that does not mean 'hodler' is hardcoded within the 'buy' function.
            Function Security Analysis for BoringSingleNFT._transferBase(address)
                There are no modifiers should be examined in function _transferBase.
                Check direct function security
                    - function BoringSingleNFT._transferBase(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                      Reason: The function _transferBase does not contain any condition checks involving msg.sender, so it does not match the required structures.
                    - function BoringSingleNFT._transferBase(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                      Reason: The code provided does not contain any of the required patterns, as there are no `require` statements or `if` conditions with logical checks
                      that would lead to the toggling of the same boolean variable between true and false, or vice versa.
                Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
                The reachable functions are ['buy', '_transfer', 'safeTransferFrom', 'constructor', 'safeTransferFrom', 'transferFrom']
                    Function Security Analysis for Canvas.buy()
                        There are no modifiers should be examined in function buy.
                        Check direct function security
                            - function Canvas.buy() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                              Reason: The function does not check for any conditions involving msg.sender with respect to xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
                            - function Canvas.buy() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                              Reason: The code contains a `require` statement with a condition but does not satisfy the pattern outlined in the structures provided.
                              Specifically, the statement `require(msg.value == price, "Value != price");` does not involve assigning a variable `xxx` to `True` or
                              `False` as required by the templates, nor does it use a variable consistently in such manner afterwards in the code. Thus, it doesn't match
                              any of the given structures.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
