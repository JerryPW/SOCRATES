Function Security Analysis for EtherRolling.withdraw(uint8)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function withdraw.
    Check direct function security
        - function EtherRolling.withdraw(uint8) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any checks specifically restricting or allowing the execution of code based on whether `msg.sender` is a specific owner,
          address, leader, or CEO. All conditional logic is related to payouts and bonuses, not sender validation for such roles.
        - function EtherRolling.withdraw(uint8) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function does have a structure where a variable is set to false based on a condition, but it does not strictly follow the required pattern. To be
          specific, at the very end of the function there is a statement that sets 'users[msg.sender].isWithdrawActive = false;' based on a condition, but there is no
          matched 'require' or 'if' statement using '!xxx' before changing its value. Thus, the function does not strictly follow any of the specified structures.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['address(msg.sender).transfer(to_payout)', '_token.send(msg.sender,to_payout,TokenWithdrawed)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - address(msg.sender).transfer(to_payout) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call
        'address(msg.sender).transfer(to_payout)' contains the keyword '.transfer(', satisfying the first characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - _token.send(msg.sender,to_payout,TokenWithdrawed) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 3.
    Analyze Gas
        - _token.send(msg.sender,to_payout,TokenWithdrawed) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['_token.send(msg.sender,to_payout,TokenWithdrawed)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['_token'] should be checked in variable _token
        Checked variables: _token
            Yes 1. The provided code is a constructor, which is explicitly named 'constructor'. Therefore, it satisfies the first characteristic. 2. The state variable
            '_token' is directly assigned within the constructor using '_token = IERC777(token);'. Therefore, it does not have any hardcoded value and does not satisfy
            the second characteristic.  Since the code satisfies the first characteristic (being a constructor), the output is 'Yes'.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
