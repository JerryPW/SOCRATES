    Analyze External Address
        There are ['minter'] should be checked in variable minter
        Checked variables: minter
            Yes The given code contains a constructor for the 'LiquidityPool' contract, as indicated by the presence of 'constructor() public'. This matches the first
            characteristic to check for, that the function is a constructor. However, there is no indication that the 'minter' state variable is hardcoded, since it is
            set using an address in the constructor and can also be updated in the 'updateMinter' function externally. Therefore, the code meets the characteristic of
            having a constructor, not hardcoding the state variable.
        There are ['uniswapV2'] should be checked in variable uniswapV2
        Checked variables: uniswapV2
            Yes The code contains a constructor function, which is named "constructor", and in this constructor, the state variable "uniswapV2" is hardcoded with the
            value "0x7a250d5630B4cF539739dF2C5dAcb4c659F2488D". This satisfies both characteristics where the function is a constructor and the state variable is
            hardcoded with a specific address in the constructor.
        There are ['uniswapV2'] should be checked in variable uniswapV2
        Checked variables: uniswapV2
            Yes The code contains a constructor, which is named 'constructor', and within this constructor, the state variable 'uniswapV2' is hardcoded with a specific
            address '0x7a250d5630B4cF539739dF2C5dAcb4c659F2488D'.
        There are ['minter'] should be checked in variable minter
        Checked variables: minter
            Yes The provided code includes a function explicitly named 'constructor', which initializes various state variables, including 'minter'. This function matches
            the first characteristic as it is the constructor function for the contract. Therefore, it satisfies at least one of the given characteristics.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
