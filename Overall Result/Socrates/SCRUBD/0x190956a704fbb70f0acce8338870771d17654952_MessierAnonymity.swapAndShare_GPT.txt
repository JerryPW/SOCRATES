Function Security Analysis for MessierAnonymity.swapAndShare()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function swapAndShare.
    Check direct function security
        - function MessierAnonymity.swapAndShare() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not include any authorization checks or conditions related to msg.sender such as require, if, or assert statements for specific owner
          or leader roles.
        - function MessierAnonymity.swapAndShare() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not include any of the required structures. It lacks the use of the same variable being required to be true or false, subsequently
          assigned the opposite Boolean value, and then optionally flipped back.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['deposit', 'forceSwapAndShare']
        Function Security Analysis for MessierAnonymity.deposit(bytes32)
            The modifier of function deposit are ['nonReentrant']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier nonReentrant is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: Upon re-evaluating the code, the lock operation is present where `_guardCounter` is incremented, and the unlock operation is implied by the
                  requirement that checks `localCounter == _guardCounter`. The function name 'nonReentrant' also suggests its purpose is to prevent reentrancy attacks,
                  fitting either rule 2 or the inference in rule 3. Therefore, the previous assessment remains correct with no structural omissions found.
        Function Security Analysis for MessierAnonymity.forceSwapAndShare()
            The modifier of function forceSwapAndShare are ['onlyOwner']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The code contains a require statement that enforces only the owner, identified by `messier_owner`, can execute the function. This satisfies rule
                  1, which checks for conditions allowing only specific addresses to execute the function.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
