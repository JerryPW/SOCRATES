Function Security Analysis for EthTokenToSmthSwaps.withdraw(bytes32,address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function withdraw.
    Check direct function security
        - function EthTokenToSmthSwaps.withdraw(bytes32,address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any requirement or conditional check directly involving the condition where msg.sender should or should not be an owner or
          similar roles.
        - function EthTokenToSmthSwaps.withdraw(bytes32,address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures. There are no require statements checking if a variable is true or false followed by
          reassigning the same variable to the opposite value, nor are there any if statements followed by assignments in the described pattern. Hence, it doesn't match
          any of the required patterns.

    Analyze External Address
        There are ['swaps'] should be checked in variable swap
        Checked variables: swaps
            No The provided functions in the code do not include a constructor function. None of the function names match the contract name 'EthTokenToSmthSwaps', nor is
            there a function explicitly named 'constructor'. Additionally, there is no evidence in the functions provided that the state variable 'swaps' is being
            hardcoded with a fixed value. All assignments and operations involving 'swaps' appear dynamic and based on function parameters passed during execution.
            Function Security Analysis for EthTokenToSmthSwaps.createSwap(bytes20,address,uint256,address)
                There are no modifiers should be examined in function createSwap.
                Check direct function security
                    - function EthTokenToSmthSwaps.createSwap(bytes20,address,uint256,address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                      Reason: The function does not use any of the specified patterns that involve checking the msg.sender against a specific owner or leader address.
                    - function EthTokenToSmthSwaps.createSwap(bytes20,address,uint256,address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                      Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures: it has 'require' conditions, but none relate to changing a boolean variable as
                      outlined in the conditions.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
