                - function ExclusiveDividendTracker.process(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not have any 'require' or 'if' statements checking a boolean variable and then setting its value. It lacks the specific code
                  patterns described in the task.
