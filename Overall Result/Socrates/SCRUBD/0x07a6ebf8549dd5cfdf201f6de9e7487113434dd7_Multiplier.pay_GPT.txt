Function Security Analysis for Multiplier.pay()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function pay.
    Check direct function security
        - function Multiplier.pay() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures that check for msg.sender with the specified roles (xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO).
        - function Multiplier.pay() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code contains neither of the specified structures involving checks or conditions with a boolean variable being set to True/False, nor is there a
          require or if-throw structure present. It mostly deals with processing payments to investors in a queue without using such conditional structures for booleans.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['fallback']
        Function Security Analysis for Multiplier.fallback()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
            Check direct function security
                - function Multiplier.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain any explicit conditions like 'require', 'if', 'assert' comparing `msg.sender` with specific owner or leader addresses
                  as listed in the criteria.
                - function Multiplier.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: Upon re-evaluation, the code does contain 'require(!isContract(msg.sender));', but it does not contain the corresponding 'isContract(msg.sender)
                  = True; or xxx = True;' statement that is required directly after as per the structures outlined. Therefore, there is no complete structure match
                  present in the code according to the criteria specified.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['dep.depositor.send(money)', 'dep.depositor.send(dep.expect)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - dep.depositor.send(money) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the '.send('
        keyword indicating that it matches the specified characteristics.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - dep.depositor.send(dep.expect) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the
        '.send(' keyword indicating that it matches the specified characteristics.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
