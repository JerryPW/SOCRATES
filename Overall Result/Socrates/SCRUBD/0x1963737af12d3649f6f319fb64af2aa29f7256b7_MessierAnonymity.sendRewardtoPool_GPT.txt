Function Security Analysis for MessierAnonymity.sendRewardtoPool()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function sendRewardtoPool.
    Check direct function security
        - function MessierAnonymity.sendRewardtoPool() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The provided code does not include any conditions that check if msg.sender is equal to or not equal to any owner or address. It simply iterates over a
          loop for the poolIndex and executes token transfers without such conditional statements.
        - function MessierAnonymity.sendRewardtoPool() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures that involve 'require' or 'if' statements with specific boolean assignments.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['withdraw', 'deposit']
        Function Security Analysis for MessierAnonymity.withdraw(bytes,bytes32,bytes32,address,address,uint256,uint256)
            The modifier of function withdraw are ['nonReentrant']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier nonReentrant is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The modifier 'nonReentrant' matches rule 3, as its function name is commonly used to prevent reentrancy attacks. Additionally, the code
                  structure enforces this by using a lock operation with '_guardCounter' to ensure the function is only entered once by using an increment and a
                  comparison to prevent reentrancy.
        Function Security Analysis for MessierAnonymity.deposit(bytes32)
            The modifier of function deposit are ['nonReentrant']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier nonReentrant is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The code uses a lock operation to prevent reentrancy: 1. The statement '_guardCounter += 1;' acts as a lock by incrementing the counter. 2. The
                  statement 'require(localCounter == _guardCounter, "ReentrancyGuard: reentrant call");' acts as an unlock by ensuring the function has not been re-
                  entered before resetting the lock.  Thus, it satisfies both lock and unlock requirements of characteristic 2.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
