Function Security Analysis for FarmMain._toggleSetup(uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _toggleSetup.
    Check direct function security
        - function FarmMain._toggleSetup(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the four specified characteristics relating to msg.sender checks or assertions against an Owner, Address, Leader, or
          CEO role.
        - function FarmMain._toggleSetup(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any `require(xxx == True); xxx = False;`, `require(xxx == False); xxx = True;`, `require(!xxx); xxx = True;`, or `if(!xxx)
          throw; xxx = true;` structures as described in the instructions. It does have a `require(block.number > _setupsInfo[setup.infoIndex].startBlock, "Too early for
          this setup");` statement, but it doesn't change the same variable within the following lines that match the criteria given. Thus, based on the outlined
          structures, the answer is 'No'.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['setFarmingSetups', '_setOrAddFarmingSetupInfo', 'init', '_removeLiquidity', 'withdrawReward', 'withdrawLiquidity', 'unlock',
    'activateSetup']
        Function Security Analysis for FarmMain.setFarmingSetups(FarmingSetupConfiguration[])
            The modifier of function setFarmingSetups are ['byExtension']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier byExtension is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The modifier 'byExtension' includes a 'require' statement that ensures 'msg.sender' is equal to '_extension'. This matches the first
                  characteristic of checking if only specific addresses can execute the function.
        Function Security Analysis for FarmMain._setOrAddFarmingSetupInfo(FarmingSetupInfo,bool,bool,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function _setOrAddFarmingSetupInfo.
            Check direct function security
                - function FarmMain._setOrAddFarmingSetupInfo(FarmingSetupInfo,bool,bool,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of
                msg.sender
                  Reason: The code doesn't contain any conditions checking msg.sender for specific roles or addresses like Owner, Address, Leader, or CEO.
                - function FarmMain._setOrAddFarmingSetupInfo(FarmingSetupInfo,bool,bool,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not match any of the listed structures in terms of conditional checking and assignments related to the same variable. While it
                  does use `require` statements to check conditions, it does not flip the boolean values of a single variable in a sequence that matches any of the
                  specified structures.
            Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
            The reachable functions are ['setFarmingSetups', 'init']
                Function Security Analysis for FarmMain.setFarmingSetups(FarmingSetupConfiguration[])
                    The modifier of function setFarmingSetups are ['byExtension']
                    The result of checking modifiers:
                        - modifier byExtension is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                          Reason: The code uses 'require(msg.sender == _extension, "Unauthorized");', which enforces that only the address _extension can execute the
                          function. This matches characteristic 1. There are no lock operations in the code that would match characteristic 2.
                Function Security Analysis for FarmMain.init(address,bytes,address,address,bytes)
                    There are no modifiers should be examined in function init.
                    Check direct function security
                        - function FarmMain.init(address,bytes,address,address,bytes) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                          Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structural requirements such as checks or assertions on the msg.sender compared to
                          certain roles like xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO.
                        - function FarmMain.init(address,bytes,address,address,bytes) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                          Reason: The given code snippet does not match any of the specified structures. It includes 'require' statements, but none of them are checking a
                          boolean variable for a state and altering it as per the given structure.

Function Security Analysis for FarmMain._ensureTransfer(uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _ensureTransfer.
    Check direct function security
        - function FarmMain._ensureTransfer(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not include any checks on msg.sender for roles like xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO. It focuses on balance ensuring and
          transferring tokens.
        - function FarmMain._ensureTransfer(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code doesn't meet any of the specified structures as it does not contain any 'require' or 'if' statements that manipulate a single boolean variable
          through checks and assignments as described.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['setFarmingSetups', '_setOrAddFarmingSetupInfo', 'init', '_toggleSetup', '_removeLiquidity', 'withdrawReward', 'withdrawLiquidity',

        Function Security Analysis for FarmMain.setFarmingSetups(FarmingSetupConfiguration[])
            The modifier of function setFarmingSetups are ['byExtension']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier byExtension is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: Re-evaluating the modifier, it uses 'require(msg.sender == _extension, "Unauthorized")'. This directly checks if the caller's address
                  ('msg.sender') matches a specific address stored in '_extension'. This aligns with the first rule that enforces function execution by specific addresses
                  only. The modifier does not contain lock/unlock operations, so rule two is not applicable here.
        Function Security Analysis for FarmMain._setOrAddFarmingSetupInfo(FarmingSetupInfo,bool,bool,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function _setOrAddFarmingSetupInfo.

                - function FarmMain._setOrAddFarmingSetupInfo(FarmingSetupInfo,bool,bool,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of
                msg.sender
                  Reason: The provided function does not contain any statement that checks msg.sender against xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO, which are necessary
                  conditions to return 'Yes'.
                - function FarmMain._setOrAddFarmingSetupInfo(FarmingSetupInfo,bool,bool,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures. It uses require statements, but none of them match the particular patterns
                  described (require(xxx == True); xxx = False or require(xxx == False); xxx = True or require(!xxx); xxx = True or if(!xxx) throw; xxx = true).
            Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.

                    The modifier of function setFarmingSetups are ['byExtension']
                    The result of checking modifiers:
                        - modifier byExtension is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                          Reason: The code uses 'require(msg.sender == _extension, "Unauthorized");', which restricts execution to a specific address, fulfilling the
                          first characteristic.
                Function Security Analysis for FarmMain.init(address,bytes,address,address,bytes)

                          Reason: The code does not contain any require/assert statements, 'if' condition blocks or throw statements that specifically check if msg.sender
                          is equal or not equal to an owner/leader/CEO address.
                        - function FarmMain.init(address,bytes,address,address,bytes) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                          Reason: The provided code does not have any of the specified structures (require(xxx == True/False) or require(!xxx) or if(!xxx) throw, followed
                          by xxx assignment).

            No 1. The function is not a constructor because its name 'init' does not match the contract name 'FarmMain', nor is it explicitly named 'constructor'. 2. The
            state variable '_extension' is being set with the argument 'extension', which is not hardcoded. The condition is checked using `require((_extension =
            extension) != address(0), "extension");`, where 'extension' is a parameter, not a hardcoded value. Therefore, neither characteristic is satisfied.
