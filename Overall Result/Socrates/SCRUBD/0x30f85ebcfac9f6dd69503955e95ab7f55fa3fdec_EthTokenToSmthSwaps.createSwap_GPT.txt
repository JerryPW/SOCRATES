    Analyze External Address
        The variable '_token' in external call 'ERC20(_token).transferFrom(msg.sender,this,_value)' has no state variable assigned. Therefore we check whether it has been
        hardcoded in the function.
            No The _token variable is not hardcoded as its value is provided as an argument to the function createSwap, allowing it to be dynamically set each time the
            function is called.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
