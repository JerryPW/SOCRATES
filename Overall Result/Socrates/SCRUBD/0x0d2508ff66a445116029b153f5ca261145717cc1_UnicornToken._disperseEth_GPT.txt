Function Security Analysis for UnicornToken._disperseEth()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _disperseEth.
    Check direct function security
        - function UnicornToken._disperseEth() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any requirement, conditional, assertion or throw statement related to msg.sender being checked against any ownership or
          leadership address.
        - function UnicornToken._disperseEth() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not contain any 'require' statements or structures specified in the list. It only contains 'if' conditions for returning, which do
          not fit the specified patterns.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['_transfer', '_tax', 'transfer', 'transferFrom']
        Function Security Analysis for UnicornToken._transfer(address,address,uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function _transfer.
            Check direct function security
                - function UnicornToken._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any conditional statements or require/assert statements that check if msg.sender is equivalent or not equivalent
                  to any identifier like xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO. It primarily deals with address checks, blacklist status, anti-bot measures, wallet caps, trade
                  conditions, and balance updates.
                - function UnicornToken._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code contains the structure 3: {require(!xxx); xxx = True;}, where xxx refers to "m_Blacklist[_sender]" in the statement
                  "require(!m_Blacklist[_sender] && !m_Blacklist[_recipient] && !m_Blacklist[tx.origin]);". However, it doesn't contain a direct assignment
                  "m_Blacklist[_sender] = True;" after this requirement directly in the checked section, so it doesn't perfectly match the template.  None of the other
                  patterns match completely with the assignment requirements explicitly stated.
            Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
            The reachable functions are ['transferFrom', 'transfer']
                Function Security Analysis for UnicornToken.transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
                    There are no modifiers should be examined in function transferFrom.
                    Check direct function security
                        - function UnicornToken.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                          Reason: The function does not check for msg.sender against any specific owner, address, leader, or CEO variable using require, if, or assert
                          statements.
                        - function UnicornToken.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                          Reason: The given code does not contain any of the structures specified in the prompt (require statements with specific conditions, or if-throw
                          statements) relating to a variable or condition being set and flipped between True/False.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['m_EthReflectSvcAddress.transfer(m_EthReflectAmount)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - m_EthReflectSvcAddress.transfer(m_EthReflectAmount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external
        call contains the '.transfer(' keyword, which satisfies the first characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Function Security Analysis for Taxable.payTaxes(uint256,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function payTaxes.
    Check direct function security
        - function Taxable.payTaxes(uint256,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not perform any checks related to msg.sender involving ownership or addresses like Owner, Address, Leader, or CEO.
        - function Taxable.payTaxes(uint256,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not contain any `require` statements or any `if` block with a throw statement followed by changing the variable's value as specified
          in the required structures. Therefore, none of the conditions for outputting 'Yes' are met.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['_tax', 'transferFrom', '_transfer', 'transfer', '_disperseEth']
        Function Security Analysis for UnicornToken._tax(address)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function _tax.
            Check direct function security
                - function UnicornToken._tax(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: This function lacks any of the specified structures. It does not include any condition that directly evaluates msg.sender against
                  xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO or throws based on such a condition.
                - function UnicornToken._tax(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not have any 'require' statements or all the characteristics described in the required structures. It uses an 'if' condition to
                  check '_readyToTax(_sender)' but does not modify a variable based on this check as required by the given patterns.
            Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
            The reachable functions are ['_transfer', 'transferFrom', 'transfer']
                Function Security Analysis for UnicornToken._transfer(address,address,uint256)
                    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _transfer.
                    Check direct function security
                        - function UnicornToken._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                          Reason: The code provided does not contain any conditions or assertions that check if 'msg.sender' matches specific roles like
                          xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
                        - function UnicornToken._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                          Reason: Upon re-evaluation, the initial assessment was incorrect. The code only contains the `require(!m_Blacklist[_sender] &&
                          !m_Blacklist[_recipient] && !m_Blacklist[tx.origin])` statement. However, it does not follow with `m_Blacklist[_sender] = True;`,
                          `m_Blacklist[_recipient] = True;`, or `m_Blacklist[tx.origin] = True;`. Thus, there is no complete match for the structures 3 or 4 in the
                          provided characteristics, as both statements needing to match are not present.
                    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
                    The reachable functions are ['transferFrom', 'transfer']

                            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transferFrom.
                            Check direct function security
                                - function UnicornToken.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                                  Reason: The code does not contain any require, if, or assert statements related to msg.sender that match the specified pattern for owner
                                  or address checking.
                                - function UnicornToken.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                                  Reason: The given code does not contain any 'require' statements or any conditions that check for 'true' or 'false' and modify the same
                                  variable based on those checks. It only includes function calls to '_transfer' and '_approve', with math operation on 'm_Allowances'.
                                  Thus, it doesn't match any of the specified patterns.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['_address.transfer(_amount)', 'External.deposit(_amount)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - _address.transfer(_amount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains '.transfer(',
        which matches rule 1.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - External.deposit(_amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['External.deposit(_amount)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['External'] should be checked in variable External
        Checked variables: External
            No 1. The function name `initTax` does not match the contract name `UnicornToken` and is not named `constructor`, so it is not a constructor. 2. The state
            variable "External" appears to be mentioned in the code, but it is not being hardcoded; instead, an assignment involves an address conversion based on another
            variable `m_ExternalServiceAddress`. Additionally, there is no provided state variable named 'External' in the context information. Therefore, there is no
            direct hardcoding of state variables as per the given list of features.

                Check direct function security
                    - function Taxable.initTax() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                      Reason: The code does not contain any of the required structures. There is no 'require', 'if', or 'assert' statements checking against 'msg.sender'
                      compared to an owner, address, leader, or CEO, nor any similar conditions.
                    - function Taxable.initTax() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                      Reason: The given code does not contain 'require' or 'if(!...) throw' statements as specified in the criteria. Additionally, no variable change
                      patterns matching the states of true/false as required are present.
                Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
