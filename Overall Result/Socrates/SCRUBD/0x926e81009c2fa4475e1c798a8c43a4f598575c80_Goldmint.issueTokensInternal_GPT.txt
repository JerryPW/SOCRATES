Function Security Analysis for Goldmint.issueTokensInternal(address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function issueTokensInternal.
    Check direct function security
        - function Goldmint.issueTokensInternal(address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not have any of the specified structures that involve checking msg.sender with respect to xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
        - function Goldmint.issueTokensInternal(address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code uses a `require` statement, but it does not check a boolean variable to update it in the manner described in the specified structures.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['issueTokensFromOtherCurrency', 'buyTokens', 'fallback']
        Function Security Analysis for Goldmint.issueTokensFromOtherCurrency(address,uint256)
            The modifier of function issueTokensFromOtherCurrency are ['onlyInState', 'onlyOtherCurrenciesChecker']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyInState has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier only checks whether the contract is in a specific state (`state == currentState`). It does not enforce any ownership or authorized
                  address access control, does not use lock operations, nor does it have a function name suggesting such a behavior.
                - modifier onlyOtherCurrenciesChecker is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: Rule 1: The require statement in the modifier enforces that only the specific address (otherCurrenciesChecker) can execute the function. There
                  are no structural omissions as this matches the characteristic directly.
        Function Security Analysis for Goldmint.buyTokens(address)
            The modifier of function buyTokens are ['onlyInState']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyInState has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier 'onlyInState' seems to suggest a restriction based on the function name, but it doesn't match the specific conditions outlined in
                  the provided characteristics. It does not enforce access control based on addresses or include any non-reentrancy mechanisms.
            Check direct function security
                - function Goldmint.buyTokens(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code doesn't check for the specific structures related to msg.sender == xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO, which are essential to output 'Yes'.
                - function Goldmint.buyTokens(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code has a `require(msg.value!=0);` statement but does not contain any subsequent statements that assign a boolean value to the
                  variable checked or throw an exception based on a boolean variable. Therefore, it does not match any of the specified structures.

        - mntToken.issueTokens(_to,_tokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['mntToken.issueTokens(_to,_tokens)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['mntToken'] should be checked in variable mntToken
        Checked variables: mntToken
            Yes The function name 'Goldmint' matches the contract name, indicating that it is a constructor. Constructors are typically used for initialization purposes
            during contract deployment.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
