    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.

          function, aligning with rule 1. There are no structural omissions as the code is explicitly checking for ownership, and there is no lock/unlock operation to
          assess for rule 2.
