Function Security Analysis for BDSM_Crowdsale.fallback()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
    Check direct function security
        - function BDSM_Crowdsale.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any checks or assertions related to msg.sender being equal to or not equal to an owner, address, leader, or CEO.
        - function BDSM_Crowdsale.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code contains the condition 'if(!tokensWithdrawn)', which prompts an action when the condition is true and subsequently changes the
          'tokensWithdrawn' state to true. However, to fit structure 4, it should have initially thrown an exception if !tokensWithdrawn wasn't true, and then changed the
          state to true. Hence, it doesn't strictly match the required structures.

    Analyze Transfer
        - msg.sender.transfer(msg.value-sendETH) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call contains
        '.transfer(' keyword, as found in 'msg.sender.transfer('.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - sharesTokenAddress.transfer(safeContract,sharesTokenAddress.balanceOf(this)) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - msg.sender.transfer(msg.value-actualETHTransfer) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call contains
        '.transfer(' keyword, as found in 'msg.sender.transfer('.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - owner.transfer(sendETH) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call contains '.transfer(' keyword, as
        found in 'owner.transfer('.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - sharesTokenAddress.transfer(msg.sender,tokenToBuy) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - msg.sender.transfer(msg.value) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call contains '.transfer('
        keyword, as found in 'msg.sender.transfer('.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - sharesTokenAddress.transfer(msg.sender,tokenFree) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - owner.transfer(actualETHTransfer) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call contains '.transfer('
        keyword, as found in 'owner.transfer('.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - sharesTokenAddress.balanceOf(this) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - sharesTokenAddress.transfer(safeContract,sharesTokenAddress.balanceOf(this)) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - sharesTokenAddress.transfer(msg.sender,tokenToBuy) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - sharesTokenAddress.transfer(msg.sender,tokenFree) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['sharesTokenAddress.balanceOf(this)', 'sharesTokenAddress.transfer(safeContract,sharesTokenAddress.balanceOf(this))',
    'sharesTokenAddress.transfer(msg.sender,tokenToBuy)', 'sharesTokenAddress.transfer(msg.sender,tokenFree)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['sharesTokenAddress'] should be checked in variable sharesTokenAddress
        Checked variables: sharesTokenAddress
            Yes The function name matches the contract name 'BDSM_Crowdsale', indicating it is likely a constructor.
        There are ['sharesTokenAddress'] should be checked in variable sharesTokenAddress
        Checked variables: sharesTokenAddress
            Yes The function provided is named 'BDSM_Crowdsale', which matches the contract name 'BDSM_Crowdsale'. This indicates that the code is a constructor.
        There are ['sharesTokenAddress'] should be checked in variable sharesTokenAddress
        Checked variables: sharesTokenAddress
            Yes The function name 'BDSM_Crowdsale' matches the contract name 'BDSM_Crowdsale', indicating that it is a constructor.
        There are ['sharesTokenAddress'] should be checked in variable sharesTokenAddress
        Checked variables: sharesTokenAddress
            Yes The function 'BDSM_Crowdsale' has the same name as the contract 'BDSM_Crowdsale', which indicates that it is a constructor of the contract. Constructers
            are functions whose names match the contract name and are executed once during the contract's deployment to initialize the contract's state variables.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
