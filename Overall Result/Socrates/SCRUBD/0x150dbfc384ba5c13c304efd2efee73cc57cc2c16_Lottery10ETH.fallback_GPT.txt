Function Security Analysis for Lottery10ETH.fallback()
    The modifier of function fallback are ['notFromContract']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier notFromContract has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier checks if the caller is not a contract by verifying that the code size at the caller's address is zero using extcodesize. This does not
          explicitly enforce ownership or use a lock mechanism as described in characteristics 1 and 2. The modifier name 'notFromContract' does not imply ownership or
          reentrancy prevention, so it does not fit characteristic 3 either.
    Check direct function security
        - function Lottery10ETH.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any statements that check or assert conditions involving msg.sender in relation to roles such as Owner, Address, Leader, or
          CEO.
        - function Lottery10ETH.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: None of the required structures (1 through 4) for the variable 'xxx' are found in the provided code. There is no 'require' statement that sets and
          resets a boolean in the specified manner, nor a conditional throw and reset pattern.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['RS.newTicket()', 'RS.addReferrer(bytesToAddress(bytes(msg.data)))', 'msg.sender.transfer(msg.value-PRICE)', 'x.purchase(msg.sender)',
    'LT.emitEvent(msg.sender)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - msg.sender.transfer(msg.value-PRICE) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        'msg.sender.transfer(msg.value-PRICE)' contains the '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.

        - RS.newTicket() ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - RS.addReferrer(bytesToAddress(bytes(msg.data))) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - x.purchase(msg.sender) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.

    Remaining external call: ['RS.newTicket()', 'RS.addReferrer(bytesToAddress(bytes(msg.data)))', 'x.purchase(msg.sender)', 'LT.emitEvent(msg.sender)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['RS'] should be checked in variable RS
        Checked variables: RS
            Yes The provided code snippet is a constructor because it is named 'constructor', which is explicitly mentioned in rule 1. Therefore, this satisfies the first
            characteristic regarding constructor identification.
        There are ['RS'] should be checked in variable RS
        Checked variables: RS
            Yes The provided code is a constructor because the function is explicitly named 'constructor'.
        There are ['x'] should be checked in variable x
        Checked variables: x
            Yes The provided contract code includes a constructor function that matches the contract name `Lottery10ETH`. The code snippet provided is a constructor
            because it specifically states `constructor(address RS_Addr)` and includes initializations typical for a constructor, such as setting up state variables and
            incrementing `gameCount`. The drawing function does not hardcode the state variable `x`, as the logic involves dynamic operations with `x`. Therefore, the
            constructor characteristic is satisfied.
        There are ['LT'] should be checked in variable LT
        Checked variables: LT
            Yes The provided code contains a function named 'constructor', which explicitly indicates that it is a constructor function. Constructor functions meet the
            first characteristic as they are used to initialize the contract state during deployment and their name either matches the contract name or is explicitly
            named 'constructor'.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: Lottery10ETH.drawing()
Function Security Analysis for Lottery10ETH.drawing()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function drawing.
    Check direct function security
        - function Lottery10ETH.drawing() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function `drawing` does not contain any of the specified structures that check `msg.sender` against an owner or address field like
          `xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO`. It primarily involves logic relating to the game drawing process.
        - function Lottery10ETH.drawing() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given function does not include any of the specified structures. It lacks a require statement checking the state of a boolean variable followed by
          setting the same variable to true or false. The require statement present checks a condition on block.number instead, unrelated to a variable, and doesn't
          modify a boolean variable subsequently.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['fallback']
        Function Security Analysis for Lottery10ETH.fallback()
            The modifier of function fallback are ['notFromContract']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier notFromContract has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The code in the modifier checks whether the caller is a contract by examining the extcodesize, ensuring that only external accounts can execute
                  the function and not contracts. Although this does not directly enforce ownership or specific address checks, it restricts the caller type.
            Check direct function security
                - function Lottery10ETH.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not check for msg.sender being equal or not equal to xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO using the specified structures.
                - function Lottery10ETH.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code uses 'require' statements, but none match the specific structures provided in the task definition. There is no sequence where a
                  variable is set to True or False after a specific requirement or if condition as outlined in the criteria.

    Analyze External Address
        There are ['WT'] should be checked in variable WT
        Checked variables: WT
            Yes The given code snippet is a constructor because the function name 'constructor' is explicitly used, matching the typical naming convention for
            constructors in Solidity. It initializes several variables, including 'WT', and increments 'gameCount'.
        There are ['x'] should be checked in variable x
        Checked variables: x
            Yes 1. The provided code contains a constructor function `constructor` which exactly matches rule #1 for checking constructor based on the name. 2. The
            drawing function does use the state variable 'x', but it is not hardcoded; it's being set and used, not hardcoded to a constant value.
        There are ['RS'] should be checked in variable RS
        Checked variables: RS
            Yes The provided code is a constructor for the contract named Lottery10ETH. The function is explicitly named 'constructor', which satisfies the first
            characteristic. The state variable 'RS' is not hardcoded in this constructor but assigned using a parameter, RS_Addr, so this does not satisfy the second
            characteristic.
        There are ['WT'] should be checked in variable WT
        Checked variables: WT
            Yes The function in the provided code is named 'constructor', which indicates that it is indeed a constructor for the contract. Constructors are special
            functions used to initialize state variables and are called only once when the contract is deployed. In this case, it is hardcoding the initialization of the
            WT state variable as 'WT = new WinnerTicket();'.
        There are ['x'] should be checked in variable x
        Checked variables: x
            Yes The provided code snippet includes a function that is a constructor because it is explicitly named 'constructor' and is part of the code. Its function
            name matches the standard constructor naming, which is simply 'constructor'. This satisfies characteristic 1.
        There are ['WT'] should be checked in variable WT
        Checked variables: WT
            Yes The code snippet provided is a constructor because the function is named 'constructor', which aligns with characteristic 1.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
