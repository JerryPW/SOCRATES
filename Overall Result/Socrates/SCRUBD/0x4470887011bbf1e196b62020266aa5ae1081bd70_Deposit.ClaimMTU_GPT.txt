Function Security Analysis for Deposit.ClaimMTU(bool)
    The modifier of function ClaimMTU are ['paused']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier paused has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier name and content do not imply limiting access to a specific owner or using a reentrancy lock. It checks the state of a variable 'Paused',
          without any reference to specific addresses or a locking mechanism.
    Check direct function security
        - function Deposit.ClaimMTU(bool) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: No patterns found matching the specified structures involving msg.sender with xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO.
        - function Deposit.ClaimMTU(bool) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code provided does not contain any of the defined structures. There is no use of 'require(xxx == True)' followed by 'xxx = False', or 'require(xxx
          == False)' followed by 'xxx = True', or any equivalent form using '!' operator or 'if(!xxx) throw;'.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['msg.sender.transfer(ethVal)', 'getAddress(team).transfer(ethVal/20)', 'tokenTransfer.transfer(msg.sender,claimTokens)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - msg.sender.transfer(ethVal) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        'msg.sender.transfer(ethVal)' contains the keyword '.transfer('.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - getAddress(team).transfer(ethVal/20) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        'getAddress(team).transfer(ethVal/20)' contains the keyword '.transfer('.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - tokenTransfer.transfer(msg.sender,claimTokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - tokenTransfer.transfer(msg.sender,claimTokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['tokenTransfer.transfer(msg.sender,claimTokens)']
    Analyze External Address
        The variable 'tokenTransfer' in external call 'tokenTransfer.transfer(msg.sender,claimTokens)' has no state variable assigned. Therefore we check whether it has
        been hardcoded in the function.
            No The variable `tokenTransfer` is initialized dynamically with the line `token tokenTransfer = token(tokenAddress);`. Here, `tokenAddress` is obtained by
            calling a function `getAddress("unit")`, which likely retrieves the address from some external source or state, depending on the contract's environment.
            Hence, `tokenTransfer` is not hardcoded as its instantiation involves external values rather than a static assignment.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
