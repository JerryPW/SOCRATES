Function Security Analysis for Loan._userRefund(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _userRefund.
    Check direct function security
        - function Loan._userRefund(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code checks if msg.sender is equal to shareholder, which is a specific address variable and fits the characteristic described in point 1 and 3.
          However, the relevant checks are not used in a require() or assert() statement, nor do they result in a throw, which means this does not match the exact
          structures outlined in 1, 2, 3 or 4.
        - function Loan._userRefund(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code contains the statement '_result = false;' before any other logic is executed and manipulated only inside conditions. However, it
          doesn't match the specified structures, as there is no 'require' or '!xxx' pattern with matching conditions and variable usage across the statements mentioned.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['userRefund']
        Function Security Analysis for Loan.userRefund()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function userRefund.
            Check direct function security
                - function Loan.userRefund() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any conditional checks against 'msg.sender'.
                - function Loan.userRefund() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The given function does not contain any of the specified structures with 'require' or 'if' statements followed by assignments to the same
                  variable.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['_to.transfer(amount)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - _to.transfer(amount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the '.transfer('
        keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: Loan.checkPayShareholder()
Function Security Analysis for Loan.checkPayShareholder()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function checkPayShareholder.
    Check direct function security
        - function Loan.checkPayShareholder() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any conditional checks involving `msg.sender` comparing it against an owner or specific addresses like xxxOwner, xxxAddress,
          Leader, or CEO.
        - function Loan.checkPayShareholder() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code snippet does not contain any of the specified code structures or conditions listed. It lacks the 'require' function or the specific
          if-check followed by the throwing of an exception. Additionally, it does not manipulate a boolean variable based on those conditions.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['autoCheckPayShareholder', '_userRefund', 'userRefund']
        Function Security Analysis for Loan.autoCheckPayShareholder()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function autoCheckPayShareholder.
            Check direct function security
                - function Loan.autoCheckPayShareholder() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain msg.sender checks against any named entities like xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO.
                - function Loan.autoCheckPayShareholder() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code provided doesn't match any of the specified structures as there are no 'require', 'if', or variable assignments of False/True in the
                  format given.
            Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
            There are no reachable function for internal/private function, please manually check its successor contracts.
        Function Security Analysis for Loan._userRefund(address)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function _userRefund.
            Check direct function security
                - function Loan._userRefund(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not satisfy any of the specified structures. It only includes a condition that checks if msg.sender equals 'shareholder', but
                  it doesn't align with the specified patterns because it is not a direct access control using msg.sender against a defined ownership variable explicitly
                  setting restrictions or requirements according to the given patterns.
                - function Loan._userRefund(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code does not contain the specific sequences mentioned in the provided structures: 1) require(xxx == True); xxx = False; 2) require(xxx ==
                  False); xxx = True; 3) require(!xxx); xxx = True; 4) if(!xxx) throw; xxx = true;. Although it has require and assignment statements, they do not match
                  the conditions specified.
            Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
            The reachable functions are ['userRefund']
                Function Security Analysis for Loan.userRefund()
                    There are no modifiers should be examined in function userRefund.
                    Check direct function security
                        - function Loan.userRefund() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                          Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures involving comparisons or conditions on msg.sender.
                        - function Loan.userRefund() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                          Reason: The provided function does not contain any of the specific code structures mentioned in the guidelines. It simply calls another function
                          and returns its result without any `require` statements or assignments to a variable named `xxx`.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['shareholder.transfer(toShareHolder)', 'token.profitOrgPay.value(toShareHolder)()']
    Analyze Transfer
        - shareholder.transfer(toShareHolder) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call
        'shareholder.transfer(toShareHolder)' contains the '.transfer(' keyword, satisfying the first characteristic.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - token.profitOrgPay.value(toShareHolder)() ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['token.profitOrgPay.value(toShareHolder)()']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['shareholder'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: shareholder
        There are no function that assign and initialize this variable. Please further manually check on successor contracts or modifiers.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
