    Check direct function security
        - function Escrow.cancelTransaction(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not check or restrict access based on the msg.sender address or compare it against a specific owner or privileged address.
        - function Escrow.cancelTransaction(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code contains the line 'require(transaction.status == transactionStatus.Pending);' but does not have the corresponding line where
          'transaction.status' is set to 'transactionStatus.Pending'. Instead, 'transaction.status' is set to 'transactionStatus.Canceled'. Therefore, it doesn't match
          any of the outlined structures.

                  an address from getAddress) can execute the function. This matches rule 1.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
