    The modifier of function signatureDropMultipleAmount are ['onlyAdmin', 'validBalanceMultiple']

        - modifier onlyAdmin is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The modifier uses 'require(msg.sender == admin);' to enforce that only the admin address can execute the function. This matches characteristic 1, as it
          checks for ownership or specific addresses. There are no structural omissions in this context as it clearly enforces access control. Structure 2 is not
          applicable here since there is no lock operation present.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
