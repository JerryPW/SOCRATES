Function Security Analysis for FarmMain.addLiquidity(uint256,FarmingPositionRequest)
    The modifier of function addLiquidity are ['activeSetupOnly', 'byPositionOwner']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier activeSetupOnly has no relation with controlled by owner.
          Reason: The modifier does not enforce owner or specific address execution or contain a lock operation. It only checks the activation and validity of a setup
          based on the block number.
        - modifier byPositionOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The modifier 'byPositionOwner' contains the line 'require(_positions[positionId].uniqueOwner == msg.sender && _positions[positionId].creationBlock != 0,
          "Not owned");'. This requires the msg.sender to be the unique owner of a specific position. This matches rule 1, as it enforces that only specific addresses
          (i.e., the unique owner) can execute the function. There is no structural omission here, as the code explicitly checks for ownership using the msg.sender.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
