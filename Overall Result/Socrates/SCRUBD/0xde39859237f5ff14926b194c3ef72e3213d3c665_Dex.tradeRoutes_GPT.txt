Function Security Analysis for Dex.tradeRoutes(ERC20,uint256,ERC20,uint256,address[])
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function tradeRoutes.
    Check direct function security
        - function Dex.tradeRoutes(ERC20,uint256,ERC20,uint256,address[]) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified patterns relating to msg.sender comparison with owner or leader variables.
        - function Dex.tradeRoutes(ERC20,uint256,ERC20,uint256,address[]) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the required structures with 'require', 'if', or conditions as per the given patterns or conditions to check variable
          values for transition between True and False in any structured way. It uses 'assert' for a condition, and 'require' for transferring tokens, but this does not
          fit into the given structures.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['dest.transfer(msg.sender,destAmount)', 'msg.sender.send(destAmount)', 'src.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),srcAmount)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - dest.transfer(msg.sender,destAmount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - msg.sender.send(destAmount) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains '.send('
        keyword with 'msg.sender.send(destAmount)'.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - dest.transfer(msg.sender,destAmount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - src.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),srcAmount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['dest.transfer(msg.sender,destAmount)', 'src.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),srcAmount)']
    Analyze External Address
        The variable 'dest' in external call 'dest.transfer(msg.sender,destAmount)' has no state variable assigned. Therefore we check whether it has been hardcoded in
        the function.
            No The variable 'dest' is not hardcoded in the function because it is used as a parameter that is input by whoever calls the function. A hardcoded variable
            would mean that the function has a fixed value for 'dest' that cannot be changed when the function is called, which is not the case here.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
