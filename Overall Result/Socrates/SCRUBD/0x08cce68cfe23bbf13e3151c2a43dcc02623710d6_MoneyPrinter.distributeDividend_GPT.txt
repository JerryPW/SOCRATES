Function Security Analysis for MoneyPrinter.distributeDividend(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function distributeDividend.
    Check direct function security
        - function MoneyPrinter.distributeDividend(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code checks if a shareholder's shares amount is 0 and returns if true, but it does not check the msg.sender against any specific owner or address.
          The function does not satisfy any of the specified characteristics since it doesn't involve any require/assert statement or msg.sender validation against
          ownership roles.
        - function MoneyPrinter.distributeDividend(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided code block does not contain any 'require' or 'if' statements that match the specified patterns related to variable assignment of true or
          false.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['setShare', 'goBrrr', 'process']
        Function Security Analysis for MoneyPrinter.setShare(address,uint256)
            The modifier of function setShare are ['onlyToken']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyToken is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: Upon reviewing the modifier onlyToken, it uses the require statement to ensure that only a specific address (_token) can execute the function.
                  This matches the first rule where the function checks if msg.sender matches a specific address (_token). There is no indication of a locking mechanism
                  or any reference to another function name like nonReentrant that might imply a lock operation by its naming convention.
        Function Security Analysis for MoneyPrinter.goBrrr(address)
            The modifier of function goBrrr are ['onlyToken']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyToken is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The code in the modifier enforces that only a specific address (stored in the variable _token) can execute the function, meeting characteristic
                  1 of checking ownership or specific address execution enforcement. There is no indication of a lock mechanism, so characteristic 2 is not applicable.
        Function Security Analysis for MoneyPrinter.process(uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function process.
            Check direct function security
                - function MoneyPrinter.process(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any checks against msg.sender with the specified patterns.
                - function MoneyPrinter.process(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code lacks any 'require' statements or 'if' statements that throw an exception, which are preconditions for matching any of the patterns
                  given in the structure.

        - IERC20(DigitalGold).transfer(shareholder,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['IERC20(DigitalGold).transfer(shareholder,amount)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['DigitalGold'] should be checked in variable DigitalGold
        Checked variables: DigitalGold
            Yes The provided code contains a constructor function as indicated by the keyword 'constructor'. In this constructor, the state variable 'DigitalGold' is
            indeed hardcoded to a specific address: 0x2260FAC5E5542a773Aa44fBCfeDf7C193bc2C599. This satisfies the check for both a constructor function and a hardcoded
            state variable. Therefore, it meets at least one of the specified characteristics.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
