Function Security Analysis for BitChordCrowdsale.buy(address,uint256,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function buy.
    Check direct function security
        - function BitChordCrowdsale.buy(address,uint256,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The provided function does not include any conditions or assertions that check if msg.sender is equal to or different from
          xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO. The function primarily deals with purchasing logic and updates, without incorporating any access control relating to msg.sender.
        - function BitChordCrowdsale.buy(address,uint256,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function does not contain any require or if statements with the specific structures provided in the characteristics.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['fallback']
        Function Security Analysis for BitChordCrowdsale.fallback()
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function fallback.
            Check direct function security
                - function BitChordCrowdsale.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function does not contain any conditional or assertion statement related to msg.sender being equal to or not equal to specific roles or
                  addresses like xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO.
                - function BitChordCrowdsale.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The code provided does not exhibit any of the specified structures. There are require statements present, but they do not involve any assignment
                  or change of state for the same variable that meet the required patterns. The requires are simply gating logic that do not modify any variable to True
                  or False afterward.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['token.transfer(_address,tokensToSend)', 'distributionAddress.transfer(address(this).balance.sub(oraclizeBalance))',
    'msg.sender.transfer(_value.sub(ethRequire))', 'token.transfer(_address,availableTokens)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - token.transfer(_address,tokensToSend) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
        - distributionAddress.transfer(address(this).balance.sub(oraclizeBalance)) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the
        reason: The external call 'distributionAddress.transfer(address(this).balance.sub(oraclizeBalance))' contains '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in
        'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - msg.sender.transfer(_value.sub(ethRequire)) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        'msg.sender.transfer(_value.sub(ethRequire))' contains '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
        - token.transfer(_address,availableTokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - token.transfer(_address,tokensToSend) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - token.transfer(_address,availableTokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['token.transfer(_address,tokensToSend)', 'token.transfer(_address,availableTokens)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            Yes The function name 'BitChordCrowdsale' matches the contract name, indicating that it is a constructor. Constructors are typically used to initialize a
            contract's state variables and are executed once when the contract is created, satisfying the first characteristic.
        There are ['token'] should be checked in variable token
        Checked variables: token
            Yes The code snippet provided is for the function named 'BitChordCrowdsale', which matches the contract name 'BitChordCrowdsale', hence it is a constructor
            function.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
