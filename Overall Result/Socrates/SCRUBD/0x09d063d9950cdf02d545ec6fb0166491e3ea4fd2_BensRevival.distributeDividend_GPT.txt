Function Security Analysis for BensRevival.distributeDividend(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function distributeDividend.
    Check direct function security
        - function BensRevival.distributeDividend(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any checks involving 'msg.sender' against a 'xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO' pattern in line with the specified
          structures.
        - function BensRevival.distributeDividend(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not have any of the required characteristic structures, as it lacks any statements using 'require' or using a similar conditional
          structure directly related to setting a boolean variable to true or false.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['setShare', 'claimTokens', 'process']
        Function Security Analysis for BensRevival.setShare(address,uint256)
            The modifier of function setShare are ['onlyToken']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyToken is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: Upon reviewing the code, the modifier 'onlyToken' contains a require statement that verifies msg.sender is equal to a specific address (_token),
                  enforcing that only a specific address can execute the function. This matches rule 1 entirely without any structural omission.
        Function Security Analysis for BensRevival.claimTokens(address)
            The modifier of function claimTokens are ['onlyToken']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier onlyToken is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: Upon reevaluation, the judgment remains the same. The code clearly includes a require statement that checks if msg.sender is a specific address
                  (_token), enforcing specific address execution. There are no structural omissions related to a lock operation in this code since we are judging based on
                  characteristic 1.
        Function Security Analysis for BensRevival.process(uint256)
            There are no modifiers should be examined in function process.
            Check direct function security
                - function BensRevival.process(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The provided function does not include any checks or conditions related to msg.sender being compared to any xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO
                  variables using require, if, or assert statements as described in the criteria.
                - function BensRevival.process(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The provided code does not contain any of the specified structures involving require statements or if statements with throw related to a boolean
                  variable followed by its negation or affirmation within the same code block. The code includes a loop structure and condition checks related to gas
                  usage and shareholder distribution, but these do not fit the given patterns.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['IERC20(REVIVAL).transfer(shareholder,amount)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - IERC20(REVIVAL).transfer(shareholder,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - IERC20(REVIVAL).transfer(shareholder,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['IERC20(REVIVAL).transfer(shareholder,amount)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['REVIVAL'] should be checked in variable REVIVAL
        Checked variables: REVIVAL
            Yes The function in the provided code is a constructor. This is evident from the function being explicitly named 'constructor', which matches the constructor
            characteristic. Additionally, the constructor function hardcodes the state variable 'REVIVAL' by setting it to a specific literal address value.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
