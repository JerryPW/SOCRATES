    Analyze External Address
        There are ['_ledgerExternalTokensAddresses'] should be checked in variable i
        Checked variables: _ledgerExternalTokensAddresses
            No The code provided does not match the contract name 'Town'; thus, it is not a constructor. Additionally, there is no hardcoded state variable
            '_ledgerExternalTokensAddresses' within the functions provided. The functions work with '_ledgerExternalTokensAddresses', but it is used as a part of logic
            and not hardcoded with a specific value, thus it does not satisfy the condition for hardcoding.
            Function Security Analysis for Town.distributionSnapshot()
                There are no modifiers should be examined in function distributionSnapshot.
                Check direct function security
                    - function Town.distributionSnapshot() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                      Reason: The code does not contain any access control logic related to the identity of the sender (msg.sender). There are no require, if, or assert
                      statements checking msg.sender against any address like Owner, Leader or CEO.
                    - function Town.distributionSnapshot() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                      Reason: The code does not contain any conditional or throw statement that checks the truth value of a variable and then changes it. For example,
                      there is no 'require' or 'if' statement that is directly followed by an assignment to the same variable that it checks, such as {require(xxx ==
                      True); xxx = False;} or {if(!xxx) throw; xxx = true;}.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
