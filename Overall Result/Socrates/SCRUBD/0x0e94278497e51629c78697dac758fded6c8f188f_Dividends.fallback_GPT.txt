          checked variable afterwards. This doesn't match any of the specified structures.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['user.transfer(userether)', 'tokenReward.balanceOf(user)']
    Analyze Transfer

        'user.transfer(userether)' contains the '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - tokenReward.balanceOf(user) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['tokenReward.balanceOf(user)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['tokenReward'] should be checked in variable tokenReward
        Checked variables: tokenReward
            Yes The provided code shows a function named "Dividends", which matches the contract name. According to the first characteristic, if the function name matches
            the contract name, it is likely a constructor.
