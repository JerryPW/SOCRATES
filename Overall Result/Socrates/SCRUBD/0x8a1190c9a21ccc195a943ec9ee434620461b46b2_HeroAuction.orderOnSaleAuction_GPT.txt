Function Security Analysis for HeroAuction.orderOnSaleAuction(uint256,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function orderOnSaleAuction.
    Check direct function security
        - function HeroAuction.orderOnSaleAuction(uint256,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not contain any checks that explicitly compare msg.sender with any specific roles like xxxOwner, xxxAddress, Leader, or CEO. It only
          checks the balance of msg.sender and other conditions.
        - function HeroAuction.orderOnSaleAuction(uint256,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the required structures such as 'require(xxx == True); xxx = False;', 'require(xxx == False); xxx = True;',
          'require(!xxx); xxx = True;', or 'if(!xxx) throw; xxx = true'. The 'require' statements in the code are checking conditions not equating to a boolean 'True' or
          'False'.

    Analyze External Address
        There are ['saleAuction'] should be checked in variable saleAuction
        Checked variables: saleAuction
            No The function provided is named 'setSaleAuctionAddress' and does not match the contract name 'HeroAuction', indicating it is not a constructor. The state
            variable 'saleAuction' is being set, but it is not hardcoded with a particular value; instead, it is set using the parameter '_address'. Therefore, the
            function does not satisfy any of the given characteristics.
            Function Security Analysis for HeroAuction.setSaleAuctionAddress(address)
                The modifier of function setSaleAuctionAddress are ['onlyLeader']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyLeader is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The modifier requires that 'msg.sender' is equal to 'leaderAddress', enforcing that only the specific address can execute the function. This
                      corresponds to characteristic 1, as it checks if 'msg.sender == xxxAddress' before executing the function.
        There are ['saleAuction'] should be checked in variable saleAuction
        Checked variables: saleAuction
            No The function is not a constructor as its name does not match the contract name 'HeroAuction', nor is it explicitly named 'constructor'. Additionally, the
            function does not hardcode the state variable 'saleAuction', instead, it assigns it a value based on the parameter '_address' and validates it using
            'isSaleClockAuction()' function, which is not hardcoding.
            Function Security Analysis for HeroAuction.setSaleAuctionAddress(address)
                The modifier of function setSaleAuctionAddress are ['onlyLeader']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyLeader is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The modifier enforces that only the address stored in 'leaderAddress' can execute the function by using 'require(msg.sender ==
                      leaderAddress);'. This satisfies Rule 1, as the structure matches the requirement that only specific addresses can execute the function.
        There are ['saleAuction'] should be checked in variable saleAuction
        Checked variables: saleAuction
            No The given code is a function named "setSaleAuctionAddress", which is not explicitly a constructor because its name does not match the contract name
            "HeroAuction", nor is it named "constructor". Furthermore, the state variable 'saleAuction' is not hardcoded in the function's code, as it is assigned a new
            value based on the _address parameter provided at runtime, dynimically setting the saleAuction variable to the candidateContract. Hence, this function does
            not satisfy either of the specified characteristics.
            Function Security Analysis for HeroAuction.setSaleAuctionAddress(address)
                The modifier of function setSaleAuctionAddress are ['onlyLeader']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyLeader is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The modifier enforces that only the leader, identified by the 'leaderAddress', can execute the function. The statement 'require(msg.sender
                      == leaderAddress);' matches rule 1. There is no lock operation involved, thus rule 2 is not applicable.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
