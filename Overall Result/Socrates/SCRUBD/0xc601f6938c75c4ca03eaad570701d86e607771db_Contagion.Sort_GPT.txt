            Check direct function security
                - function Contagion.fallback() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The function only checks for `msg.value` and does not involve `msg.sender` comparisons for an owner or specific address.
                - function Contagion.fallback() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.

                  variable by setting it as true or false as required by the patterns defined.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['owner.send(feecounter)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - owner.send(feecounter) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call contains the keyword
        '.send(' which is one of the specified characteristics.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
    Remaining external call: []
    No more external call should be analyzed.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
