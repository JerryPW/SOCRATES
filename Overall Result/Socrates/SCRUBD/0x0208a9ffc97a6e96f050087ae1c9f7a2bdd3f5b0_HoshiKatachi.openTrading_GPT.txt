        - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.

          function. This directly corresponds to the characteristic 1: 'require(msg.sender == xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO)'. There are no structural omissions as the
          requirement is clearly enforced by the require statement, satisfying condition 1 alone without needing to check for locks/unlocks or modifier naming
          conventions.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
