Function Security Analysis for dividendsContract.collectDividends(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function collectDividends.
    Check direct function security
        - function dividendsContract.collectDividends(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The condition `require(msg.sender == member && dc.endDate() < now);` does have a check involving msg.sender, but it's comparing msg.sender with a
          function parameter (member), not an owner, address, or leader role as defined by xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO. Therefore, this doesn't match the required
          structures.
        - function dividendsContract.collectDividends(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given code does not meet any of the specified structures as it lacks any require statements that set a boolean variable followed by a complimentary
          assignment to that same variable within the discussed context.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['dc.balanceOf(member)', 'member.transfer(payout)', 'dc.endDate()']
    Analyze Transfer
        - member.transfer(payout) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The call 'member.transfer(payout)' contains
        the keyword '.transfer('.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - dc.balanceOf(member) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - dc.endDate() ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['dc.balanceOf(member)', 'dc.endDate()']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['dc'] should be checked in variable dc
        Checked variables: dc
            No The function name 'ICOaddress' does not match the contract name 'dividendsContract' and is not explicitly named 'constructor'. Therefore, the function is
            not a constructor. Additionally, the function assigns the passed parameter '_t' to the state variable 'ICOaddress', so it does not hardcode it. Although it
            assigns a value to the state variable 'dc', it uses the result from the external method Ethernational(_t) rather than a hardcoded value. Therefore, neither of
            the characteristics are satisfied.
            Function Security Analysis for dividendsContract.ICOaddress(address)
                The modifier of function ICOaddress are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The code uses 'require(msg.sender == owner);', which satisfies the first characteristic, ensuring only the owner can execute the function.
                      There are no structural omissions as this is the only relevant condition needed for this characteristic.
        There are ['dc'] should be checked in variable dc
        Checked variables: dc
            No 1. The function name 'ICOaddress' does not match the contract name 'dividendsContract', and it is not explicitly named 'constructor', so it is not a
            constructor. 2. The function assigns a value to the state variable 'dc', but it is not hardcoded as it is assigned via a parameter '_t'. Instead, 'dc' is set
            using the value provided to the function, which means it is not a hardcoded assignment.
            Function Security Analysis for dividendsContract.ICOaddress(address)
                The modifier of function ICOaddress are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The code uses 'require(msg.sender == owner);' which matches the structure of checking if the sender is the owner. This satisfies rule 1.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
