Function Security Analysis for Multiplier.verify(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function verify.
    Check direct function security
        - function Multiplier.verify(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The condition 'if (msg.sender != owner())' checks if the sender is not the owner. However, 'owner' in this context appears to be a function or local
          construct rather than a directly referenced state variable like xxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO, and thus does not match the specified structures.
        - function Multiplier.verify(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the required structures: checking for a boolean condition followed by setting a boolean variable according to the
          specified patterns or throwing an error based on that condition.
