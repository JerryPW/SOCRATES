Function Security Analysis for EthTokenToSmthSwaps.refund(address)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function refund.
    Check direct function security
        - function EthTokenToSmthSwaps.refund(address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not have any structure that controls access based on msg.sender being an owner or equivalent.
        - function EthTokenToSmthSwaps.refund(address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The function does not contain any of the specified structures that require a boolean check followed by assignments to that variable.

    Analyze Transfer
        - ERC20(swap.token).transfer(msg.sender,swap.balance) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - ERC20(swap.token).transfer(msg.sender,swap.balance) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['ERC20(swap.token).transfer(msg.sender,swap.balance)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['swaps'] should be checked in variable swap
        Checked variables: swaps
            No After evaluating the provided code and characteristics, we can make the following observations:  1. Constructor Check: The function names provided are:
            createSwap, createSwapTarget, withdraw, withdrawNoMoney, withdrawOther, and clean. None of these functions are named 'EthTokenToSmthSwaps', which is the
            provided contract name, nor is any function explicitly named 'constructor'. Therefore, none of the functions can be identified as a constructor.  2. Hardcoded
            State Variable Check: The state variable is 'swaps'. All the functions interact with the 'swaps' state variable but none of them have this state variable
            hardcoded to a specific value. They dynamically handle the state variable based on inputs such as  _ownerAddress, _participantAddress, and msg.sender. Hence,
            there is no hardcoded usage of the 'swaps' state variable.  Since the evaluation of each function does not meet the criteria of either being a constructor or
            having a hardcoded state variable, the output is 'No'.
            Function Security Analysis for EthTokenToSmthSwaps.createSwap(bytes20,address,uint256,address)
                There are no modifiers should be examined in function createSwap.
                Check direct function security
                    - function EthTokenToSmthSwaps.createSwap(bytes20,address,uint256,address) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                      Reason: The provided function does not contain any check or assertion of msg.sender against a specific owner or leader's address.
                    - function EthTokenToSmthSwaps.createSwap(bytes20,address,uint256,address) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                      Reason: The code provided does not contain any of the specified structures, as it lacks any statements involving 'require(xxx == True)' or
                      'require(xxx == False)', nor does it use '!xxx' or 'if(!xxx) throw' with related variable assignments.
Conclusion: This function will cause REE Problem.
