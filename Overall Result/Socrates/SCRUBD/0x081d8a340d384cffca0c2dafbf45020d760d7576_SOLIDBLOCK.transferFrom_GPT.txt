Function Security Analysis for SOLIDBLOCK.transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function transferFrom.
    Check direct function security
        - function SOLIDBLOCK.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code checks the allowance for a transfer but does not involve any direct comparison or assertion involving msg.sender against a specific owner or
          leader address.
        - function SOLIDBLOCK.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not have any of the structures specified in the characteristics. There is a 'require' statement, but it doesn't check equality with True
          or False; it compares two values to ensure one is greater than or equal to the other.

Function Security Analysis for SOLIDBLOCK._transfer(address,address,uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _transfer.
    Check direct function security
        - function SOLIDBLOCK._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not include any condition structures like 'require', 'if', or 'assert' that specifically check if 'msg.sender' is equal to or not
          equal to an owner, address, leader, or CEO. It validates different conditions such as ensuring addresses are not zero, trading allowances, transaction limits,
          and more, but none are related to verifying 'msg.sender' against specific authority roles.
        - function SOLIDBLOCK._transfer(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code does not contain any of the required structures specified in the given patterns (i.e., no matching 'require' followed by variable assignment
          with same variable across the function).
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['transferFrom', 'transfer']

            There are no modifiers should be examined in function transferFrom.
            Check direct function security
                - function SOLIDBLOCK.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
                  Reason: The code does not contain any of the specified structures involving msg.sender and any Owner or similar address check.
                - function SOLIDBLOCK.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
                  Reason: The function does not contain any of the required structures. It contains a require statement that checks for condition (currentAllowance >=
                  amount) but does not modify the variable being checked in the way described in the conditions. Therefore, none of the patterns match.

Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.

Start analyze function: SOLIDBLOCK.swapTokensForETH(uint256)
Function Security Analysis for SOLIDBLOCK.swapTokensForETH(uint256)
    The modifier of function swapTokensForETH are ['lockTheSwap']
    The result of checking modifiers:
        - modifier lockTheSwap is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
          Reason: The modifier 'lockTheSwap' sets a flag 'swapping' to true before executing the function body and resets it to false afterward, meeting the criteria for
          characteristic 2. Both the lock and unlock operations are present in the code.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
