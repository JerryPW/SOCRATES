Function Security Analysis for VaultWETH._claimCompoundDivs()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function _claimCompoundDivs.
    Check direct function security
        - function VaultWETH._claimCompoundDivs() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not have any statement related to msg.sender checking against any xxxxOwner/xxxAddress/Leader/CEO for authorization or condition
          checking.
        - function VaultWETH._claimCompoundDivs() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The code provided does not contain any of the specific structures outlined in the question. There are no require statements that set a variable to
          True/False immediately following a check, nor is there a conditional throw statement that immediately sets a related variable to true afterwards.
    Since the function can only be called by functions, we start to analyze indirect function security.
    The reachable functions are ['claim', 'claimCompoundDivs']
        Function Security Analysis for VaultWETH.claim(uint256)
            The modifier of function claim are ['noContractsAllowed', 'nonReentrant']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier noContractsAllowed has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier does not directly include explicit owner or specific address checks, lock operations, or named patterns like Onlyxxx or
                  nonReentrant that would match the specified characteristics.
                - modifier nonReentrant is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The code of the modifier uses a lock mechanism by setting '_status = _ENTERED;' before the function body is executed and resets it with '_status
                  = _NOT_ENTERED;' after. Both set and reset operations are present, confirming a complete lock structure that matches rule 2.
        Function Security Analysis for VaultWETH.claimCompoundDivs()
            The modifier of function claimCompoundDivs are ['noContractsAllowed', 'nonReentrant']
            The result of checking modifiers:
                - modifier noContractsAllowed has no relation with controlled by owner.
                  Reason: The modifier does not follow any of the characteristics described in the instructions. It checks if the transaction sender is the original
                  caller, which prevents smart contracts from calling the function, but it doesn't restrict access to specific addresses or use a lock mechanism.
                - modifier nonReentrant is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                  Reason: The code sets _status to _ENTERED before execution and resets it to _NOT_ENTERED after execution, which confirms the lock and unlock operations,
                  satisfying characteristic 2. Additionally, the function name 'nonReentrant' implies reentrancy prevention, aligning with characteristic 3.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
