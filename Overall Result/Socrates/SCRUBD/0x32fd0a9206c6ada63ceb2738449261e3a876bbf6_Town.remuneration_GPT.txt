Function Security Analysis for Town.remuneration(uint256)
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function remuneration.
    Check direct function security
        - function Town.remuneration(uint256) has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code does not include any conditions checking whether 'msg.sender' is equal or not equal to an owner, address, leader, or CEO. It only checks for
          token balances and allowances.
        - function Town.remuneration(uint256) has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The provided function does not exhibit any of the specified control flow structures involving require statements and assignments to a variable named
          'xxx'. The pattern for the structures checks for require statements and specific assignment sequences to the same variable, which are not present in the
          provided code.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['_token.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),restOfTokens)', '_token.transferFrom(msg.sender,user,amount)',
    'msg.sender.transfer(address(this).balance)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - msg.sender.transfer(address(this).balance) is subjected to gas limits. Therefore, it has no potential REE problem. Here is the reason: The external call
        'msg.sender.transfer(address(this).balance)' contains the '.transfer(' keyword.. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 1.
    Analyze Gas
        - _token.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),restOfTokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
        - _token.transferFrom(msg.sender,user,amount) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['_token.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),restOfTokens)', '_token.transferFrom(msg.sender,user,amount)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['_token'] should be checked in variable _token
        Checked variables: _token
            Yes The provided code is a constructor, as the function is explicitly named 'constructor'. This matches the first characteristic, which is checking whether
            the code provided is a constructor.
        There are ['_token'] should be checked in variable _token
        Checked variables: _token
            Yes 1. The provided code contains a constructor function, which is explicitly named 'constructor'. This satisfies the first characteristic, which checks
            whether the function is a constructor by checking whether it's named 'constructor'.  2. The constructor also initializes the state variable '_token' with a
            hardcoded assignment to the 'tokenAddress' parameter, so it satisfies the second characteristic of hardcoding a provided state variable.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
