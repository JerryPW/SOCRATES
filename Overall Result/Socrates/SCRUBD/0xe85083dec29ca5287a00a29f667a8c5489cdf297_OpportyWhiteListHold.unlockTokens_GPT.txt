Function Security Analysis for OpportyWhiteListHold.unlockTokens()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function unlockTokens.
    Check direct function security
        - function OpportyWhiteListHold.unlockTokens() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The function does not contain any checks related to msg.sender being an owner, address, leader, or CEO based on the provided structure guidelines.
        - function OpportyWhiteListHold.unlockTokens() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: In the code, the sequence of operations is as follows: it first checks '!holderList[msg.sender].withdrawed' using require, and only after some main
          logic executes (specifically, a call to OppToken.transfer), does it change the state of 'holderList[msg.sender].withdrawed' to true. Thus, the main logic is
          executed before the state negation, which does not satisfy the structural characteristics where state negation must happen immediately after the check and
          before any main logic. Therefore, it fails the requirement.
External Call Analysis
    Direct external call: ['OppToken.transfer(msg.sender,holderList[msg.sender].tokens)']
    Analyze Transfer
        - OppToken.transfer(msg.sender,holderList[msg.sender].tokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits. Parameter in 'transfer'/'send': 2.
    Analyze Gas
        - OppToken.transfer(msg.sender,holderList[msg.sender].tokens) ISN'T subjected to gas limits.
    Remaining external call: ['OppToken.transfer(msg.sender,holderList[msg.sender].tokens)']
    Analyze External Address
        There are ['OppToken'] should be checked in variable OppToken
        Checked variables: OppToken
            No The function 'setToken' is not a constructor because its name does not match the contract name 'OpportyWhiteListHold', nor is it explicitly named
            'constructor'. Additionally, the function does not use any hardcoded values for the state variable 'OppToken'. The address for 'OppToken' is set dynamically
            via the 'newToken' parameter that is passed to the function, and thus it is not hardcoded.
            Function Security Analysis for OpportyWhiteListHold.setToken(address)
                The modifier of function setToken are ['onlyOwner']
                The result of checking modifiers:
                    - modifier onlyOwner is controlled by owner, the function would not cause REE problem.
                      Reason: The judgment is based on the first rule. The modifier contains the statement 'require(msg.sender == owner);', ensuring only the owner can
                      execute the function, which fulfills the criteria of enforcing execution by the owner or a specific address.
Conclusion: This function will not cause REE Problem.
