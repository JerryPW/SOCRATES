Function Security Analysis for HoldPresaleContract.unlockTokens()
    There are no modifiers should be examined in function unlockTokens.
    Check direct function security
        - function HoldPresaleContract.unlockTokens() has no security assurance protected by checking the authority of msg.sender
          Reason: The code performs checks on the state and time conditions for a contributor to unlock tokens but does not restrict this action to a specific owner or
          address based on the sender's address (msg.sender). Instead, the function is open to any msg.sender and makes logical checks based on the holderList. There is
          no structure like msg.sender == xxxOwner/xxxAddress or similar conditions explicitly restricting access based on msg.sender in the specified ways.
        - function HoldPresaleContract.unlockTokens() has no apparent security assurance by utilizing a lock machinism.
          Reason: The given function does not contain any of the specified structures. While it includes conditional logic checking values and setting them if they meet
          certain conditions, the specific pattern of `require(xxx == True); xxx = False;` or `require(xxx == False); xxx = True;` or their equivalent forms as detailed
          in the criteria is not present.

            Yes The function HoldPresaleContract matches the name of the contract HoldPresaleContract, thus it is identified as a constructor. Constructors are functions
            that have the same name as the contract they are part of, especially in older versions of Solidity before version 0.4.22, where usage of 'constructor' keyword
            was introduced.
