Depot.withdrawMyDepositedSynths: GPTScan analysis start 
Prompt:
Given the following smart contract code, answer the questions below and organize the result in a json format like {"1": "Yes" or "No"}.
"1": Does it "have an external call"?

    function withdrawMyDepositedSynths()
        external
    {
        uint synthsToSend = 0;

        for (uint i = depositStartIndex; i < depositEndIndex; i++) {
            synthDeposit memory deposit = deposits[i];

            if (deposit.user == msg.sender) {
                // The user is withdrawing this deposit. Remove it from our queue.
                // We'll just leave a gap, which the purchasing logic can walk past.
                synthsToSend = synthsToSend.add(deposit.amount);
                delete deposits[i];
                //Let the DApps know we've removed this deposit
                emit SynthDepositRemoved(deposit.user, deposit.amount, i);
            }
        }

        // Update our total
        totalSellableDeposits = totalSellableDeposits.sub(synthsToSend);

        // Check if the user has tried to send deposit amounts < the minimumDepositAmount to the FIFO
        // queue which would have been added to this mapping for withdrawal only
        synthsToSend = synthsToSend.add(smallDeposits[msg.sender]);
        smallDeposits[msg.sender] = 0;

        // If there's nothing to do then go ahead and revert the transaction
        require(synthsToSend > 0, "You have no deposits to withdraw.");

        // Send their deposits back to them (minus fees)
