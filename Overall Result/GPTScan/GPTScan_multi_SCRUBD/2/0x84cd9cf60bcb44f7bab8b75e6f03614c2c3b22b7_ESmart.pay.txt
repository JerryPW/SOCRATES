Prompt:
Given the following smart contract code, answer the questions below and organize the result in a json format like {"1": "Yes" or "No"}.
"1": Does it "have an external call"?

    function pay() private {
        //Try to send all the money on contract to the first investors in line

            money = uint128(balance - jackpotAmount);

Does the following smart contract code "have an external call and followed by any state changes"? Answer only "Yes" or "No".
