        Corn(object).transfer(msg.sender, workDone[msg.sender]);
        workDone[msg.sender] = 0;
    }
Response:
{"1": "Yes"}

Prompt:
Does the following smart contract code "have an external call and followed by any state changes"? Answer only "Yes" or "No".

    function reapFarm() external {
        require(workDone[msg.sender] > 0);
        Corn(object).transfer(msg.sender, workDone[msg.sender]);
        workDone[msg.sender] = 0;
    }
    
Response:
Yes

Prompt:
In this function, which statement updates a state variable? Please answer in a section starting with "StatementsA:".
In this function, which statement executes an external call? Please answer in a section starting with "StatementsB:".
In this function, which variable holds the sender's address of the external call? Please answer in a section starting with "VariableA:". 
Please answer strictly in the following format: {"StatementsA": {"State update statement":"Description"}, "StatementsB": {"External call statement"ï¼š"Description"}, "VariableA": {"Variable name": "Description"}}

    function reapFarm() external {
        require(workDone[msg.sender] > 0);
        Corn(object).transfer(msg.sender, workDone[msg.sender]);
        workDone[msg.sender] = 0;
    }
Response:
{"StatementsA": {"workDone[msg.sender] = 0;":"Resets the workDone mapping for the sender to zero."}, "StatementsB": {"Corn(object).transfer(msg.sender, workDone[msg.sender]);":"Transfers tokens to the sender using an external call to the Corn contract."}, "VariableA": {"msg.sender": "Holds the address of the sender of the external call."}}
