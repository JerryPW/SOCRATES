Prompt:
Given the following smart contract code, answer the questions below and organize the result in a json format like {"1": "Yes" or "No"}.
"1": Does it "have an external call"?

     function withdrawTokens() public {
          // 1 - wait for next month!
          uint64 oneMonth = lastWithdrawTime + 30 days;  
          require(uint(now) >= oneMonth);

          // 2 - calculate amount (only first time)
          if(withdrawsCount==0){
               amountToSend = mntToken.balanceOf(this) / 10;
          }

          require(amountToSend!=0);

          // 3 - send 1/10th
          uint currentBalance = mntToken.balanceOf(this);
          if(currentBalance<amountToSend){
             amountToSend = currentBalance;  
          }
          mntToken.transfer(teamAccountAddress,amountToSend);

          // 4 - update counter
          withdrawsCount++;
          lastWithdrawTime = uint64(now);
     }
Response:
{"1": "Yes"}

Prompt:
Does the following smart contract code "have an external call and followed by any state changes"? Answer only "Yes" or "No".

     function withdrawTokens() public {
          // 1 - wait for next month!
          uint64 oneMonth = lastWithdrawTime + 30 days;  
          require(uint(now) >= oneMonth);

          // 2 - calculate amount (only first time)
          if(withdrawsCount==0){
               amountToSend = mntToken.balanceOf(this) / 10;
          }

          require(amountToSend!=0);

          // 3 - send 1/10th
          uint currentBalance = mntToken.balanceOf(this);
          if(currentBalance<amountToSend){
             amountToSend = currentBalance;  
          }
          mntToken.transfer(teamAccountAddress,amountToSend);

          // 4 - update counter
          withdrawsCount++;
          lastWithdrawTime = uint64(now);
     }
    
Response:
Yes

Prompt:
In this function, which statement updates a state variable? Please answer in a section starting with "StatementsA:".
In this function, which statement executes an external call? Please answer in a section starting with "StatementsB:".
In this function, which variable holds the sender's address of the external call? Please answer in a section starting with "VariableA:". 
Please answer strictly in the following format: {"StatementsA": {"State update statement":"Description"}, "StatementsB": {"External call statement"ï¼š"Description"}, "VariableA": {"Variable name": "Description"}}

     function withdrawTokens() public {
          // 1 - wait for next month!
          uint64 oneMonth = lastWithdrawTime + 30 days;

     }
Response:
{"StatementsA": {"withdrawsCount++;":"Increments the withdrawsCount state variable", "lastWithdrawTime = uint64(now);":"Updates the lastWithdrawTime state variable"}, "StatementsB": {"mntToken.transfer(teamAccountAddress,amountToSend);":"Executes an external call to transfer tokens"}, "VariableA": {"teamAccountAddress": "Holds the recipient's address for the external call"}}
