IOU.withdraw: GPTScan analysis start 
Prompt:
Given the following smart contract code, answer the questions below and organize the result in a json format like {"1": "Yes" or "No"}.
"1": Does it "have an external call"?

  function withdraw() payable {
    /*
      Main mechanism to ensure a buyer's purchase/ETH/IOU is safe.

      Refund the buyer's ETH if we're beyond the cut-off date of our distribution
      promise AND if the contract doesn't have an adequate amount of tokens
      to distribute to the buyer. Time-sensitive buyer/ETH protection is only
      applicable if the contract doesn't have adequate tokens for the buyer.

      The "adequacy" check prevents the seller and/or third party attacker
      from locking down buyers' ETH by sending in an arbitrary amount of tokens.

      If for whatever reason the tokens remain locked for an unexpected period
      beyond the time defined by block.number, patient buyers may still wait until
      the contract is filled with their purchased IOUs/tokens. Once the tokens
      are here, they can initiate a withdraw() to retrieve their tokens. Attempting
      to withdraw any sooner (after the block has been mined, but tokens not arrived)
      will result in a refund of buyer's ETH.
