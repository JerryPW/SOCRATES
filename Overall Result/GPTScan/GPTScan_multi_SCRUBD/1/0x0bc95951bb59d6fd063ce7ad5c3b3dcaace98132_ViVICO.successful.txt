Prompt:
Given the following smart contract code, answer the questions below and organize the result in a json format like {"1": "Yes" or "No"}.
"1": Does it "have an external call"?

    function successful() public { 
        //When successful
        require(state == State.Successful);
        //Users have 14 days period to claim tokens
        if (now > completedAt.add(14 days)){
            //If there is any token left after
            uint256 remanent = tokenReward.balanceOf(this);
            //It's send to creator
            tokenReward.transfer(creator,remanent);
            emit LogContributorsPayout(creator, remanent);
        }
        //After successful eth is send to creator
        creator.transfer(address(this).balance);

        emit LogBeneficiaryPaid(creator);

In this function, which variable holds the sender's address of the external call? Please answer in a section starting with "VariableA:". 
Please answer strictly in the following format: {"StatementsA": {"State update statement":"Description"}, "StatementsB": {"External call statement"ï¼š"Description"}, "VariableA": {"Variable name": "Description"}}

    function successful() public { 
        //When successful
        require(state == State.Successful);
