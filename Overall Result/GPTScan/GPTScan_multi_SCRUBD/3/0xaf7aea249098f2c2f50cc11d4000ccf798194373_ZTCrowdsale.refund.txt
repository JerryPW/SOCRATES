Prompt:
Given the following smart contract code, answer the questions below and organize the result in a json format like {"1": "Yes" or "No"}.
"1": Does it "have an external call"?

    function refund() atStage(Stages.Ended) {

        // Only allow refunds if minAmount is not raised
        require(raised < minAmount);

        uint256 receivedAmount = balances[msg.sender];
        balances[msg.sender] = 0;

        if (receivedAmount > 0 && !msg.sender.send(receivedAmount)) {
            balances[msg.sender] = receivedAmount;
        }
    }

Prompt:
Does the following smart contract code "have an external call and followed by any state changes"? Answer only "Yes" or "No".

Prompt:
In this function, which statement updates a state variable? Please answer in a section starting with "StatementsA:".
In this function, which statement executes an external call? Please answer in a section starting with "StatementsB:".
In this function, which variable holds the sender's address of the external call? Please answer in a section starting with "VariableA:". 
Please answer strictly in the following format: {"StatementsA": {"State update statement":"Description"}, "StatementsB": {"External call statement"："Description"}, "VariableA": {"Variable name": "Description"}}
