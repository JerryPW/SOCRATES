Prompt:
Given the following smart contract code, answer the questions below and organize the result in a json format like {"1": "Yes" or "No"}.
"1": Does it "have an external call"?

    function doPayments() public {
        Recipient storage rec = recs[msg.sender];
        require(rec.balance >= 1e12);
        rec.addr.transfer(rec.balance);
        emit Payment(rec.addr, rec.balance);
        rec.received = (rec.received).add(rec.balance);
        rec.balance = 0;
    }
Response:
{"1": "Yes"}

Prompt:
Does the following smart contract code "have an external call and followed by any state changes"? Answer only "Yes" or "No".

Prompt:
In this function, which statement updates a state variable? Please answer in a section starting with "StatementsA:".
In this function, which statement executes an external call? Please answer in a section starting with "StatementsB:".
In this function, which variable holds the sender's address of the external call? Please answer in a section starting with "VariableA:". 
Please answer strictly in the following format: {"StatementsA": {"State update statement":"Description"}, "StatementsB": {"External call statement"："Description"}, "VariableA": {"Variable name": "Description"}}

    function doPayments() public {
        Recipient storage rec = recs[msg.sender];
