Prompt:
Given the following smart contract code, answer the questions below and organize the result in a json format like {"1": "Yes" or "No"}.
"1": Does it "have an external call"?

    function () public payable {
        if(msg.value > 0){
            require(gasleft() >= 220000, "We require more gas!"); //gas need to process transaction
            require(msg.value <= 2 ether); //We not allow big sums, it is for contract long life

            //Adding investor into queue. Now he expects to receive 111% of his deposit
            queue.push(Deposit(msg.sender, uint128(msg.value), uint128(msg.value*PROFIT/100)));
