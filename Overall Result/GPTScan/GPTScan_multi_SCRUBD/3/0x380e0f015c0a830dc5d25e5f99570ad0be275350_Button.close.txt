Button.close: GPTScan analysis start 
Prompt:
Given the following smart contract code, answer the questions below and organize the result in a json format like {"1": "Yes" or "No"}.
"1": Does it "have an external call"?

  function close() public {
    require(block.number > endBlock);

    ButtonFactory f = ButtonFactory(factory);

    if (!owner.send(3*rake/4)){
      // Owner can't accept their portion of the rake, so send it to the factory.
      f.announceWinner.value(rake)(lastPresser, address(this).balance);
    } else {
