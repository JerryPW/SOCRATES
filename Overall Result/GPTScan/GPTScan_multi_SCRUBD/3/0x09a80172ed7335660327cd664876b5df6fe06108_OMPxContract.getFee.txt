            feeReceiverContract.receiveFunds.value(feeBalance).gas(150000)();
            trackFee(feeBalance);
            feeBalance = 0;
        }
    }
Response:
{"1": "Yes"}

Prompt:
In this function, which statement updates a state variable? Please answer in a section starting with "StatementsA:".
In this function, which statement executes an external call? Please answer in a section starting with "StatementsB:".
In this function, which variable holds the sender's address of the external call? Please answer in a section starting with "VariableA:". 
Please answer strictly in the following format: {"StatementsA": {"State update statement":"Description"}, "StatementsB": {"External call statement"："Description"}, "VariableA": {"Variable name": "Description"}}

    function getFee() public {
