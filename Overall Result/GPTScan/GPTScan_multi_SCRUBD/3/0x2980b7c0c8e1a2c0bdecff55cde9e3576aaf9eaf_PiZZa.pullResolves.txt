Prompt:
Given the following smart contract code, answer the questions below and organize the result in a json format like {"1": "Yes" or "No"}.
"1": Does it "have an external call"?

	function pullResolves(uint amount) public returns (uint forfeiture){
		address sender = msg.sender;
		uint resolves = resolveWeight[ sender ];
		require(amount <= resolves && amount > 0);
		require(amount < dissolvingResolves);//"you can't forfeit the last resolve"

		uint yourTotalEarnings = (uint)((int256)(resolves * earningsPerResolve) - payouts[sender]);
		uint forfeitedEarnings = yourTotalEarnings * amount / resolves;

		// Update the payout array so that the "resolve shareholder" cannot claim resolveEarnings on previous staked resolves.
		payouts[sender] += (int256)(forfeitedEarnings) - (int256)(earningsPerResolve * amount);

		resolveWeight[sender] -= amount;
		dissolvingResolves -= amount;
		// The Ether value per token is increased proportionally.
		earningsPerResolve += forfeitedEarnings / dissolvingResolves;

		resolveToken.transfer( sender, amount );
		emit PullResolves( sender, amount, forfeitedEarnings / scaleFactor);
