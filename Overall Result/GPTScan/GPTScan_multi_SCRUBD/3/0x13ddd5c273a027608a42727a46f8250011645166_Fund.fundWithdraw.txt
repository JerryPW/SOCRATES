Prompt:
Given the following smart contract code, answer the questions below and organize the result in a json format like {"1": "Yes" or "No"}.
"1": Does it "have an external call"?

    function fundWithdraw(address addr, uint value) payable public _rA {
        require(value <= funds);
        addr.transfer(value); 
        funds -= value;
    }    
Response:
{"1": "Yes"}
--------------------------------------------------
Prompt:
Does the following smart contract code "have an external call and followed by any state changes"? Answer only "Yes" or "No".

    function fundWithdraw(address addr, uint value) payable public _rA {
        require(value <= funds);
        addr.transfer(value); 
        funds -= value;
    }    
    
Response:
Yes

Prompt:
In this function, which statement updates a state variable? Please answer in a section starting with "StatementsA:".
In this function, which statement executes an external call? Please answer in a section starting with "StatementsB:".
In this function, which variable holds the sender's address of the external call? Please answer in a section starting with "VariableA:". 
Please answer strictly in the following format: {"StatementsA": {"State update statement":"Description"}, "StatementsB": {"External call statement"："Description"}, "VariableA": {"Variable name": "Description"}}

        require(value <= funds);
        addr.transfer(value); 
        funds -= value;
    }    
Response:
{"StatementsA": {"funds -= value;":"This statement updates the state variable 'funds' by subtracting the 'value'."}, "StatementsB": {"addr.transfer(value);":"This statement executes an external call to transfer 'value' amount to the address 'addr'."}, "VariableA": {"addr": "This variable holds the address to which the external call is made."}}
