Prompt:
Given the following smart contract code, answer the questions below and organize the result in a json format like {"1": "Yes" or "No"}.
"1": Does it "have an external call"?

    function singleRefunding() private {
        Deposit storage dep = queue[queue.length - 1];
        uint amount = dep.deposit * 2 / 100 + dep.expect;
        if (reserved < amount) {
            amount = reserved;
        }
        dep.depositor.send(amount);
        reserved -= amount;

Prompt:
In this function, which statement updates a state variable? Please answer in a section starting with "StatementsA:".
In this function, which statement executes an external call? Please answer in a section starting with "StatementsB:".
In this function, which variable holds the sender's address of the external call? Please answer in a section starting with "VariableA:". 
Please answer strictly in the following format: {"StatementsA": {"State update statement":"Description"}, "StatementsB": {"External call statement"："Description"}, "VariableA": {"Variable name": "Description"}}

    function singleRefunding() private {
