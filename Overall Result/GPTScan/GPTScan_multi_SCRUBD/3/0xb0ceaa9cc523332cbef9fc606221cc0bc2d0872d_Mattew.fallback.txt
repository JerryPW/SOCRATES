Mattew.fallback: GPTScan analysis start 
Prompt:
Given the following smart contract code, answer the questions below and organize the result in a json format like {"1": "Yes" or "No"}.
"1": Does it "have an external call"?

    function () payable{
        if (block.number - PERIOD > blockheight){
            bool isSuccess = whale.send(stake);
            MattewWon("Mattew won (mattew, stake, blockheight)", whale, stake, block.number);
            setFacts();
            // selfdestruct(whale); People with Ethereum Foundation are ok with it.
            return;
            
        }else{

Prompt:
In this function, which statement updates a state variable? Answer only ZERO or ONE statement. Please answer in a section starting with "StatementsA:".
In this function, which statement executes an external call? Answer only ZERO or ONE statement.Please answer in a section starting with "StatementsB:".
In this function, which variable holds the sender's address of the external call? Please answer in a section starting with "VariableA:". 
Please answer strictly in the following format: {"StatementsA": {"State update statement":"Description"}, "StatementsB": {"External call statement"："Description"}, "VariableA": {"Variable name": "Description"}}
